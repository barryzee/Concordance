Chapter 1
==> The red leather chair was four feet away from the end of Nero Wolfe's desk, so when she got the gun from her handbag she had to get up and take a step to put it on the desk. Then she returned to the chair, closed the bag, and told Wolfe, "That's the gun I'm not going to shoot my husband with." <==
Sitting facing her with my back to my desk, which was at right angles to Wolfe's, I raised my brows. I hadn't expected her to put on an act. When she had phoned the previous afternoon to ask for an appointment she had of course sounded a little jumpy, as most people do when they call the office of a private detective, but she had been quite matter-of-fact in giving the details. Her name
was Lucy Hazen, Mrs. Barry Hazen. She gave her address, on East 37th Street between Park and Lexington. All she wanted was thirty minutes with Nero Wolfe, to tell him something confidential. She didn't want him to do anything, not even give her advice; she merely wanted to tell him something; and she would pay one hundred dollars for the half-hour. She could and would pay more if she had to, but she hoped the hundred would be enough.
In November or December, when Wolfe's income has reached a point where out of a hundred received he can keep only twenty bucks, he will make an appointment only for someone or something very special, but this was January, no big fee was in prospect, and even a measly C would help in the upkeep of his
old brownstone on West 35th Street, including staff, particularly since he wouldn't have to work for it. So it was set for 11:30 the following morning, Tuesday.
When the doorbell rang at 11:30 on the dot and I went to let her in, she gave me a smile and said, "Thank you for getting him to see me." Handshakes can be faked and usually are, but smiles can't. It isn't often that a man gets a natural, friendly, straightforward smile from a young woman who has never seen him before, with no come-on, no catch, and no dare, and the least he can do is return it if he has that kind in stock. As I took her to the office and helped her off with her coat, which was mink, I was thinking that you never know, even the good- looking wife of a well-known public relations operator like Barry Hazen could have her feelings on straight. I was pleased to meet her.

 open a conversation with a stranger by taking a revolver from her bag and saying that's the gun she isn't going to shoot her husband with. I must have been wrong about the smile, and since I don't like to be wrong I was no longer pleased to meet her. I raised my brows and tightened my lips.

==> Wolfe, in his oversized chair behind his desk, darted a glance at the gun, returned his eyes to her, and grunted. "I am not impressed," he said, "by histrionics." <==
"Oh," she said, "I'm not trying to impress you, I'm only telling you. That's what I came for, just to tell you. I thought it would be more - more definite, I guess - if I brought the gun and showed it to you."
"Very well, you have done so." Wolfe was frowning. "I understand that you intend to ask me for no service or advice; you wish only to tell me something in confidence. I should remind you that I am not a lawyer or a priest; a communication from you to me will not be privileged. If you tell me about a crime I can't engage not to disclose it. I mean a serious crime, not some petty offense such as carrying a deadly weapon for which you have no permit."
"I hadn't thought of that, carrying a weapon." She dismissed it with a little gesture. "That's all right. There hasn't been any crime and there isn't going to be, that's just the point. That's what I came to tell you, that I'm not going to shoot my husband."
Wolfe's eyes were narrowed at her. He is convinced that all women are dotty or devious, or both, and here was more evidence to support it. "Just that?" he demanded. "You wanted half an hour."
She nodded. She set her teeth on her lip, nice white teeth, and in a moment released it. "Because I thought it would be better if I told you something about ... why. If you will regard it as confidential."

She stopped and put her teeth on her lip. She shook her head, with energy, as if to chase a fly. "There you are," she said. "I mean there I am. You don't need to know all that. I'm blubbering, fishing for pity. You don't even need to know why I want to kill him."

"I don't hate him." She shook her head again. "I think
I despise him - I know I do - and he won't let me get a divorce. I tried to leave him, I did leave him, but he made such a - There I go again! I don't need to tell you all that!"
"As you please."
"It's not as I please, Mr. Wolfe, it's as I must!" "As you must, then."
"This is what I must tell you. He has a gun in a drawer in his bedroom. That's it there on your desk. We have separate bedrooms. You know how there can be something in your mind but you don't know it's there until all of a sudden there it is?"

"Certainly. The subconscious is not a grave; it's a cistern."
"But we don't know what's in it. I didn't. One day a month ago, it was the day after Christmas, I went to his bedroom and took the gun from the drawer and looked to see if it was loaded, and it was, and all of a sudden I was thinking how easy it would be to shoot him while he was in bed asleep. I said to myself, 'You idiot, you absolute idiot/ and put the gun back, and I didn't go near that drawer again. But the thought came back, it kept coming, mostly when I was trying to go to sleep, and it got worse. It got worse this way, it wasn't just going in when he was asleep and getting the gun and shooting him, it was planning how to do it so I wouldn't get caught. I knew it was idiotic, but I couldn't stop. I could not!

 And one night, just two nights ago, Sunday night, I got out of bed trembling all over and went to the shower and turned on the cold water and stood under it. I had found a plan that would work. I don't have to tell you what the plan was."

"It doesn't matter. I went back to bed, but I didn't sleep. I wasn't afraid I might do something in my sleep, I was afraid of what my mind might do. I had found out that I couldn't manage my mind. So yesterday afternoon I decided I would fix it so my mind would have to quit. I would tell someone all about it and then the plan wouldn't work, and no plan would work so I wouldn't get caught. Telling a friend wouldn't do, not a real friend, because that would leave a loophole. Of course I couldn't tell the police. I have no pastor because I don't go to church. Then I thought of you, and I phoned for an appointment, and here I am. That's all, except this: I want you to promise that if my husband is shot and killed you will tell the police about my coming here and what I said."
==> Wolfe grunted. <==
She unlocked her fingers, straightened her shoulders, and took a long deep breath - in with her mouth closed and out with it open. "There!" she said. "That's it."
Wolfe was regarding her. "I engaged only to listen," he said, "but I must offer a comment. Your stratagem should be effective as a self-deterrent, but what if someone else shoots him? And I report this conversation to the police. You'll be in a pickle."
"Not if I didn't do it."
"Pfui. Of course you will, unless the culprit is soon exposed."
"If I didn't do it I wouldn't care." She extended a hand, palm up. "Mr. Wolfe. After I decided to tell you and made the appointment, I had the first good night's sleep I have had for a month. No one is going to shoot him. I want you to promise, so I can't."

Very well." His shoulders went up a quarter of an inch and down again. "You promise?"
"Yes."
She opened her bag, a large tan leather one, and took out a checkfold and a pen. "I would rather make it a check than cash," she said, "so it will be on record. Is a check all right?"

"I mentioned a hundred dollars to Mr. Goodwin. Will that be enough?"
==> He said yes, and she wrote, resting the check on the side of the bag. To save her the trouble of getting up to hand it over I went and took it, but when she had closed the bag she arose anyway, and was turning to get her coat from the back of the chair when Wolfe spoke. <==
"Ten minutes of your half-hour is left, Mrs. Hazen, if you have any use for it."
"No, thank you. I just realized that wasn't exactly the truth, what I told Mr. Goodwin, that I only wanted to tell you something. I wanted you to promise something too. I do thank you and I won't take - oh! You say I have ten minutes?" She glanced at her wrist. She turned to me. "I would love to see the orchids - just a quick look. If you would, Mr. Goodwin?"
"It will be a pleasure," I said, and meant it, but Wolfe was pushing back his chair. "Mr. Goodwin doesn't owe you the ten minutes. I do," he said, lifting his bulk.
"Come with me. You won't need your coat." He headed for the door. She gave me a glance with a suggestion of a smile, and followed him out. The sound came from the hall of the elevator door opening and closing.
I had no kick coming. The ten thousand orchids in the three plant rooms up on the roof of the old brownstone were his, not mine. He did like to show them off - so would you if they were yours - but that wasn't why he had intervened. He had some letters to dictate, and he thought that if I took her up to look at the orchids there was no telling when we would come back down.

He said yes, and she wrote, resting the check on the side of the bag. To save her the trouble of getting up to hand it over I went and took it, but when she had closed the bag she arose anyway, and was turning to get her coat from the back of the chair when Wolfe spoke.
"Ten minutes of your half-hour is left, Mrs. Hazen, if you have any use for it."
"No, thank you. I just realized that wasn't exactly the truth, what I told Mr. Goodwin, that I only wanted to tell you something. I wanted you to promise something too. I do thank you and I won't take - oh! You say I have ten minutes?" She glanced at her wrist. She turned to me. "I would love to see the orchids - just a quick look. If you would, Mr. Goodwin?"
==> "It will be a pleasure," I said, and meant it, but Wolfe was pushing back his chair. "Mr. Goodwin doesn't owe you the ten minutes. I do," he said, lifting his bulk. <==
"Come with me. You won't need your coat." He headed for the door. She gave me a glance with a suggestion of a smile, and followed him out. The sound came from the hall of the elevator door opening and closing.
I had no kick coming. The ten thousand orchids in the three plant rooms up on the roof of the old brownstone were his, not mine. He did like to show them off - so would you if they were yours - but that wasn't why he had intervened. He had some letters to dictate, and he thought that if I took her up to look at the orchids there was no telling when we would come back down.

Years ago he decided, on insufficient evidence, that I forget about time when I am with an attractive young woman, and once he has decided something that settles it.
The phone rang. I got it at my desk and told it, "Nero Wolfe's office, Archie Goodwin speaking." It was a man over in Jersey who makes sausage to Wolfe's specifications, wanting to know if we were ready for a shipment, and I switched it to Fritz in the kitchen. Thinking there was no better way for a licensed detective to fill idle time than by snooping, I picked up the mink coat for an inspection. When I saw that the label said Bergmann I decided that inspection would be superfluous and put it back on the chair. I picked up the gun that she wasn't going to shoot her husband with. It was a Drexel .32, nice and clean, and the cylinder was full of cartridges, nothing for a lady with no permit to be toting around town. I inspected her check, East Side Bank and Trust Company, signed Lucy Hazen, and went and put it in the safe. After glancing at my watch, I turned on the radio for the noon news, and stood and stretched while

I listened to it. Algeria was boiling. A building contractor on Staten Island denied that he had had favors from a politician. Fidel Castro was telling the Cuban people that the people who ran the United States government were a bunch of bums (my translation). Then:
"The body of a man named Barry Hazen was found this morning in an alley between two buildings on Norton Street in the lower West Side of Manhattan. He had been shot in the back and had been dead for some hours. No further details are available at present. Mr. Hazen was a well-known public-relations counselor. The Democratic leaders in Congress have apparently decided to center their fire - "
I turned it off.

Chapter 2
I went and picked up the gun and smelled it, the barrel tip and the sides. That was silly but natural.
When you would like to know if a gun has been fired recently you smell it automatically, but it doesn't mean a thing unless it has just been fired, say within thirty minutes, and there has been no opportunity to clean it.
I stood with it in my hand, looking at it, and then put it in a drawer of my desk. Her bag was there on the red leather chair, and I opened it and removed the contents.
==> There were all the items you would expect a woman who wore Bergmann mink to have with her, but nothing more. I got the gun from the drawer, removed the cartridges, and examined them with a glass, to see if one of them, or maybe two, was brighter and newer than the others. They all looked alike. As I was returning the gun to the drawer the sound came from the elevator descending, its thud at the bottom, and the door opening. They entered, Mrs. Hazen in front, and she crossed to the red leather chair, picked up her bag, turned to Wolfe's desk, and then turned to me. <==
"Where's the gun?" she asked. "I'm taking it."
"There has been a development, Mrs. Hazen." I was facing her at arm's length. "I turned on the radio for the news, and he said that - I'll repeat it verbatim. He said, The body of a man named Barry Hazen was found this morning in an alley between two buildings on Norton Street in lower Manhattan. He had been shot in the back and had been dead for some hours. No further details are available at present. Mr. Hazen was a public-relations counselor.' That's what he said."
She was gawking at me. "You're m - m - m - m - " She started over. "You're making it up."
"No. That's what he said. Your husband has been shot dead."
The bag slipped from her hand to the floor and her face went white and stiff. I had seen people turn pale before, but I had never seen blood leave skin so thoroughly and so fast. She backed up an unsteady step, and I took her arm and

I moved, but she said, "Not for me. He said that?" "Yes."
"He's dead. He's dead?"
"Yes."
She rammed her fists against her temples and pounded them. Wolfe said, "I'll be in the kitchen," and turned to go. To him a woman overwhelmed, no matter by what, is merely a woman having a fit, and it's too much for him. But I said, "Hold it, she'll be all right in a minute," and he came and looked down at her, let out a growl, went to his chair, and sat.
"I want to phone somebody," she said. "I have to know. Who can I phone?" Her fists were in her lap.

"A shot of brandy or whisky wouldn't hurt," I told her. "I don't want anything. Who can I phone?"
"Nobody." Wolfe was curt. "Not just now."
Her head jerked to him. "Why not?"
"Because he must first consider whether I should phone - phone the police to report what you have told me. I promised to. Archie. Where's the gun?"

"No telling. If so it's been cleaned. It's fully loaded and the cartridges all look alike."

She shook her head. She looked at me and back at him. "Oh," she said. "You'll have to tell me what to say."
He nodded. "I expected that." His head turned. "Archie. What grounds have you for your guess?"


I was back in my chair. "Partly personal," I told him, "and partly professional. Personal, my general impression of her, and specifically her smile when I let her in. Professional, two points. First, if she shot him last night after making an appointment with you and then came here with that jabber, she is either completely loony or the trickiest specimen I have ever laid eyes on, and I'll buy neither one. Second, and this is really it, her face when she realized he was dead. She might fake a faint or the staggers or even some fancy hysterics, but no woman alive could make her blood go like that. I said I would need facts to make it final, but I should have said I would need facts, and good ones, to make me guess again."
==> Wolfe grunted and turned to her with a scowl. <==
"Granting that Mr. Goodwin's grounds are valid, what then? When the police learn that the widow of a man murdered last night came to see me this morning they will harass me beyond tolerance. I owe you nothing. You are not my client. You have paid me a hundred dollars for half an hour of my time, now stretched to more than an hour, and released me from my promise, so that incident is closed. You asked me to tell you what to say when they ask you what you came here for, but they will also ask me. What if you fail to follow my advice and my account differs from yours? Why should I take that risk? I can see no alternative - What are you doing now?"
She had opened her bag and was taking out the checkfold and pen. "I'm going to write a check," she said. "Then I'll be your client. What shall I ... how much?"
He nodded. "I expected that too. It won't do. I am not a blackmailer. I take pay for services, not for forbearance, and you may not need my services. If you do, we'll see. Will you answer some questions?"
"Of course. But I've taken more than my half an hour, and I owe you - "
"No. If you didn't shoot your husband we have both been snared by circumstance. First, instead of a question, a statement: you can't take the gun. The gun stays here. Now. When and where did - "

"I don't know exactly. Barry had told me he was going to discuss something with them, and I wouldn't be needed, and after the coffee I left. That's when I last saw him, there with them. I went upstairs to my bedroom."
"Did you hear him when he went up to bed?"
"No. There's a spare bedroom between his room and mine. And I was played out. I told you, I had the first good night's sleep I have had for a month."
"You didn't see him this morning?"
"No. He wasn't there. He rises early. The maid who - oh. Oh!" "What?"
==> "Nothing - nothing that matters to you. I am not liking myself, Mr. Wolfe. I said he rises early, but now I can say he rose early, and I wanted to sing it. I did! No one is good enough to have a right to be glad that someone has died. The Lord knows I'm not. What if I never loved him? What if I married him because - " <==
Wolfe cut her off. "If you please. You'll have plenty of time for that. About the maid?"
She swallowed with her lips pressed tight. "I'm sorry. The maid who sleeps in and gets breakfast said he hadn't come down, and she had gone up and the door of his room was open and his bed hadn't been slept in. He had done that before, not very often, once or twice a month."
"Without telling you where he was going or, afterwards, where he had been?"

 "Yes."

"Yes."
"Were you in it continually from the time you went to your bedroom last night until you left this morning?"
"Yes."
"Would the maid have heard you if you had gone out during the night? Sneaked out, and later in again?"
"I don't think so. Her room is in the basement."
==> Wolfe nodded. "You are vulnerable. What time did you leave this morning?" "At five minutes past eleven. I wanted to be sure to get here on time." "When did you take the gun from the drawer in your husband's room?" <==
"Just before I left. I didn't decide to bring it until the last minute."
"How many people know that you despised your husband?"
She gazed at him, not blinking, no reply.
"'Despise' is your word, Mrs. Hazen. It is not adequate. No one kills a man, or wants to, merely because she despises him. But I'm not going into that; it could take all day. How many people know that you despised him?"
"I don't think anyone does." It was barely audible, and I have good ears. "I have never told anyone, not even my best friend. She may have suspected, I suppose

==> "Pfui." Wolfe flipped a hand. "Your maid knows, for one, if she's not a dolt. She is of course being questioned at this moment. Was your husband wealthy?" <==
"I don't know. He had a large income, he must have, he was free with money. He owned the house."
"Any children?"
"No."
"You will inherit?"
Her eyes flashed. "Mr. Wolfe, this is ridiculous! I don't want anything from him!"

"I am merely examining your position. You will inherit?"
"Yes. He told me I would."
"Didn't he know you despised him?"
"He was incapable of believing that anyone could despise him. I suppose he was a psychopath. I looked up psychopathy in the dictionary."
"No doubt that was a help." He looked up at the wall clock. "I presume you will now go home. Since you must tell the police that you were here you might as well say that you learned of your husband's death from my radio; it will save you the bother of feigning surprise and shock." He eyed her. "I said you would be in a pickle, and you are. When I asked what you wanted of me, I shall say that you consulted me in confidence and I will reveal nothing of your conversation. It will be a little ticklish, but until and unless you are arrested on a charge of murder the pressure will not be intolerable. So you may tell them as much about your visit here, or as little, as you please."

 guess has not been discredited, we'll see."
He pushed his chair back and stood up.
She rose to her feet, steady this time, and I went and held her coat for her.

Chapter 3
==> When I returned to the office after letting her out, Wolfe had straightened up in his chair to lean forward, and, with his head cocked, was sniffing the air. For a second I thought he was pretending that our ex-client had polluted the atmosphere with perfume, but then I realized that he was merely trying to catch an odor from the kitchen, where Fritz was baking scallops in shells - or probably, since I could catch the odor without sniffing, he was deciding whether Fritz had used only shallots in the sauce or had added an onion. By the time I got to my chair he had settled it; anyway, he turned to me. <==
"I do not intend," he stated, "to serve the convenience of a murderer. What about her face? I was at one side."
"One will get you fifty," I said. "You heard her stutter that I was m - m - making it up. Then when I said no, he had been shot dead and it hit her as a fact, she went white, all white, in three seconds. Maybe she can wiggle her ears, but she can't do that. No one can."
"Very well. Call Mr. Cohen and get details."
"Anything in particular?"
"Whatever he has, but I want to know if the weapon has been found, or a bullet."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 168    window = 163 173

==> "He would appreciate a major scoop, such as that the widow of the deceased visited the office of Nero Wolfe this morning. Why not, since she's going to report it?" <==
"Very well."
I got at the phone and dialed the number of the Gazette, and soon had Lon Cohen. When I tossed him the bone about Mrs. Hazen coming to see Wolfe, naturally he wanted the whole skeleton, not to mention meat, but I told him that would be all for now and how about some reciprocity? He obliged, and gave me the crop, and I thanked him and hung up and turned to Wolfe.
"The body was found by a truck driver at ten-eighteen a.m. It was stiff, so he must have been dead at least five hours and probably more. He was fully

 dressed, including an overcoat, and his hat was there on the ground. The usual items in his pockets, including a couple of dollars in change, except that there were no keys, and no wallet and no watch. Of course they could have been taken by someone who found him earlier and forgot to mention it. His name was on letters in his pocket, so the wallet wasn't taken to delay identification. Shot once, in the back, and a rib stopped the bullet and they have it. A thirty-two. Weapon not found. If the police have any leads or notions they're saving them, but of course it was found less than three hours ago." I glanced at my wrist. "Two hours and forty-nine minutes. Lon says he would have paid me five grand if I had kept Mrs. Hazen here until he could send a man to take her picture and ask her who shot her husband, and I told him I'll bear that in mind next time."

"I've often wondered. Now tell me why I put up with you."
"That's beyond conjecture. I want a bullet that has been fired from that gun, and we shouldn't wait until after lunch. You have twenty minutes. If your guess about Mrs. Hazen is correct, that gun is not evidence, unless the murderer stole into that house afterwards, went to Mr. Hazen's room and returned the gun to the drawer, and slipped out again. If it is evidence you'll be tampering with it. Shall I do it?"
"No. You might shoot a toe off." I got the gun from the drawer, removed one of the cartridges, unlocked and opened the drawer where we keep the Marleys for which we have permits, and got a .32 cartridge from the box. I put that cartridge in the Drexel where I had made room for it, turned the cylinder so it would be in

 firing position, went to the hall and downstairs to the storage room in the basement, switched the light on, and crossed to where a discarded mattress was doubled up on a table. I had used it for this operation before. I cocked the revolver, held it three inches from the mattress, and pulled the trigger.
==> You would suppose that all .32 cartridges would send a bullet the same distance into a mattress, the same mattress, but they don't. It took me a quarter of an hour to find it, and by the time I got back upstairs Wolfe was at table in the dining room, which is across the hall from the office. Before I joined him I removed the shell, returned the Drexel's own cartridge to its place, and put the gun in the safe and the bullet in an envelope in my desk drawer. <==
*
We were back in the office, Wolfe dictating and me taking, when company came. I had been right on both counts: it was Inspector Cramer in person, and it was 2:55 when the doorbell rang and I went to the hall for a look through the one-way glass panel in the front door, and there he was on the stoop, no sign of a sag in the heavy broad shoulders, the round red face framed by his turned-up overcoat collar and the brim of his gray felt which should have been retired long ago. Since he had no appointment it would have been proper to open the door the two inches allowed by the chain bolt and greet him through the crack, but that always annoyed him, and if it turned out that I had tampered with evidence it wouldn't hurt to show him now that I had my good points. So I pulled the door wide open. Without even a nod, let alone a civil greeting, he crossed the sill, tramped down the hall into the office and on to Wolfe's desk, and demanded, "What time did Mrs. Barry Hazen get here this morning?"
Wolfe tilted his head back to look up at him and inquired, "Is that snow on your hat?"
Having entered and detoured around him, I too looked at the hat. There was nothing whatever on it except signs of age, and outdoors the sun was shining.
It would fluster any man to have it put to him that one removes one's hat when one enters a house, but Cramer is ready for anything when he faces Wolfe. It didn't faze him. He merely barked, "I asked you a question!"

 firing position, went to the hall and downstairs to the storage room in the basement, switched the light on, and crossed to where a discarded mattress was doubled up on a table. I had used it for this operation before. I cocked the revolver, held it three inches from the mattress, and pulled the trigger.
You would suppose that all .32 cartridges would send a bullet the same distance into a mattress, the same mattress, but they don't. It took me a quarter of an hour to find it, and by the time I got back upstairs Wolfe was at table in the dining room, which is across the hall from the office. Before I joined him I removed the shell, returned the Drexel's own cartridge to its place, and put the gun in the safe and the bullet in an envelope in my desk drawer.
*
==> We were back in the office, Wolfe dictating and me taking, when company came. I had been right on both counts: it was Inspector Cramer in person, and it was 2:55 when the doorbell rang and I went to the hall for a look through the one-way glass panel in the front door, and there he was on the stoop, no sign of a sag in the heavy broad shoulders, the round red face framed by his turned-up overcoat collar and the brim of his gray felt which should have been retired long ago. Since he had no appointment it would have been proper to open the door the two inches allowed by the chain bolt and greet him through the crack, but that always annoyed him, and if it turned out that I had tampered with evidence it wouldn't hurt to show him now that I had my good points. So I pulled the door wide open. Without even a nod, let alone a civil greeting, he crossed the sill, tramped down the hall into the office and on to Wolfe's desk, and demanded, "What time did Mrs. Barry Hazen get here this morning?" <==
Wolfe tilted his head back to look up at him and inquired, "Is that snow on your hat?"
Having entered and detoured around him, I too looked at the hat. There was nothing whatever on it except signs of age, and outdoors the sun was shining.
It would fluster any man to have it put to him that one removes one's hat when one enters a house, but Cramer is ready for anything when he faces Wolfe. It didn't faze him. He merely barked, "I asked you a question!"
"Half past eleven," Wolfe said.

Cramer took his overcoat off, ignored my offer to take it, put it on the arm of the red leather chair, and sat. "An hour and a half," he said, not barking but a little hoarse. He is always a little hoarse when he is dealing with Wolfe. "What did she have to say?" He hadn't touched the hat.
Wolfe swiveled and leaned back. "Mr. Cramer. I know that Mrs. Hazen's husband has been shot and killed. She was with me when the news came on my radio. I know that when I have been consulted by a person who is in any way connected with a death by violence you automatically assume that I have knowledge of evidence that would be useful in your investigation.

I got the envelope from my drawer, took the bullet out, and handed it to him. Cramer's sharp gray eyes were on me and followed the bullet back to Wolfe.
Wolfe took it in his fingers, barely glanced at it, handed it back to me, and said, "Give it to Mr. Cramer." As I did so he turned to Cramer. "This will be pointless if you have found the weapon that was used to shoot Mr. Hazen. Have you?"

"Then I suggest that you have your laboratory compare that bullet with it. If you find that they were shot by the same gun let me know at once and I'll have some information for you. I would want to see the laboratory report, certified."

"Then I suggest that you have your laboratory compare that bullet with it. If you find that they were shot by the same gun let me know at once and I'll have some information for you. I would want to see the laboratory report, certified."
"You would." Cramer's eyes were slits and his lips tightened. "Where did you get this bullet?"
"I'll tell you, or I won't, when I get your report."
"By God." Cramer was hoarser. "This is pertinent. This is evidence. I'll take you down, both of you - "
"Nonsense. Evidence of what? I don't know and neither do you. If it wasn't fired by the gun that killed Mr. Hazen it is evidence of nothing, and I am not obliged to account for it until I know. I'm not indulging in a prank, Mr. Cramer. There is a possibility that the bullets will match, and if so it will indeed be evidence. Let me know."
==> Cramer opened his mouth to say something, vetoed it, got to his feet, put the bullet in his pocket, threw the cigar at my wastebasket and missed, picked up his coat and put it on, ignoring my offer to help, and marched out. I went to the hall to see that when the door shut he was on the outside. When I returned to the office Wolfe growled. "Confound these interruptions. We have forty minutes. Where were we on that letter to Mr. Hewitt?" <==
I sat, got my notebook, and told him.
At four o'clock, when he left to go up to the plant rooms for his two-hour afternoon session with the orchids, I got busy at the typewriter. On various occasions I have had a little trouble turning out perfect letters to orchid collectors and providers of food specialties when my mind had other interests and concerns, and that day was one of the worst. Cramer had left at 3:20. He would lose no time getting the bullet to the laboratory; they probably had it by 3:50, or four o'clock at the latest. Examining two bullets with a comparison

 microscope is a simple chore; ten minutes is ample to decide if they were fired by the same gun. 4:10. Allow a quarter of an hour for writing the report, which wouldn't have to be in shape for a judge and jury. 4:25. Cramer would have a man there waiting for it. He should phone by 4:30, or ring the doorbell by 4:45. He didn't. By 5:15 I had to keep my jaw set to hit the right keys.
If you think I was keyed up more than the circumstances warranted, look it over. If the bullets matched I was a sap. It was a million to one that the murderer hadn't sneaked into the house to put the gun back in the drawer in Hazen's room; why would he? Murderers often do crazy things, but not that crazy. Therefore Mrs. Hazen had lied, and she had either killed him or knew who did, and I was a beetlehead. I had to do three of the letters twice.

==> By six o'clock, when Wolfe came down from the plant rooms, I had begun to relax. He went to his desk and started on the letters I had put there, which he always reads with care. After he had finished a couple and signed them I remarked, "Of course Cramer wouldn't bother to phone if the bullets didn't match." <==
He grunted.
"And the laboratory got it more than two hours ago, so we might as well - " The doorbell rang, and the bottom of my spine curled.
Cramer had waited until six o'clock, when he knew Wolfe would be available. I went to the hall and switched the stoop light on, and my spine went back to normal. It was a stranger, a man about my age, maybe a little younger, with no hat and a mop of brown hair shuffled by the wind. I had never been so delighted to see a stranger, but had it under control by the time I got to the door and opened it and said, "Yes, sir?"
"I want to see Nero Wolfe. My name's Weed, Theodore Weed."
I should have had him wait there while I went and told Wolfe, that was the routine, but I was so glad to see him that I invited him in and helped him off with his coat. Then I went to the office and announced, "Theodore Weed to see you. One of the dinner guests. The one who - "

If you think I was keyed up more than the circumstances warranted, look it over. If the bullets matched I was a sap. It was a million to one that the murderer hadn't sneaked into the house to put the gun back in the drawer in Hazen's room; why would he? Murderers often do crazy things, but not that crazy. Therefore Mrs. Hazen had lied, and she had either killed him or knew who did, and I was a beetlehead. I had to do three of the letters twice.
By six o'clock, when Wolfe came down from the plant rooms, I had begun to relax. He went to his desk and started on the letters I had put there, which he always reads with care. After he had finished a couple and signed them I remarked, "Of course Cramer wouldn't bother to phone if the bullets didn't match."
He grunted.
"And the laboratory got it more than two hours ago, so we might as well - " The doorbell rang, and the bottom of my spine curled.
==> Cramer had waited until six o'clock, when he knew Wolfe would be available. I went to the hall and switched the stoop light on, and my spine went back to normal. It was a stranger, a man about my age, maybe a little younger, with no hat and a mop of brown hair shuffled by the wind. I had never been so delighted to see a stranger, but had it under control by the time I got to the door and opened it and said, "Yes, sir?" <==
"I want to see Nero Wolfe. My name's Weed, Theodore Weed."
I should have had him wait there while I went and told Wolfe, that was the routine, but I was so glad to see him that I invited him in and helped him off with his coat. Then I went to the office and announced, "Theodore Weed to see you. One of the dinner guests. The one who - "
"What does he want?"

He knew damn well I hadn't had time to ask what he wanted. I said, "You."
"No. I've been pestered enough on a matter in which I have no interest. Tell him so and don't - "
Weed was there. He crossed to the red leather chair, plumped into it as if he owned it, and said, "I'm not going to pester you. I'm going to hire you."
==> Wolfe glared at me. I had let a man in without consulting him; he would have something to say about that when we were alone. Weed was going on. "I know you come high, but I pay my bills. Do you want a retainer?" <==
Wolfe had transferred the glare to him. "No. You not only intrude, you presume. Archie, show him the door."
"Now wait a minute. I'm not very ..." He let it hang and started to work his jaw. He had plenty of jaw, a little bony but not out of proportion. He got it under control. "All right, I started wrong. I'll try again. Mrs. Barry Hazen came to see you this morning and left a gun with you. Where is it?"
"Intrusion and presumption," Wolfe said, "and now effrontery. I must insist - "
"Damn it, I know she did! She told me so! She was here when she heard about it, that they had found his body! And she wanted to hire you, she wanted to give you a check, and you wouldn't take it!" He paused to control his jaw. "So I want to hire you, and I'll pay your bill. I just left the District Attorney's office and she's still there. They wouldn't let me see her, but she's there and they're going to charge her with murder. I can't see why it's presumption for me to want to hire you - you're in the detective business and my money is as good as anybody's. All right, I got ahead of myself asking you about the gun, but when I'm your client there's no reason why you shouldn't tell me where it is."
He stuck a hand in his pocket and brought out a wad of bills, not a thick one, and unfolded it.

I was trying to decide. Either he thought that Lucy Hazen had killed her husband, and was being chivalrous, or he didn't think she had but was selling Wolfe the idea that he did think so. Whichever it was, he was willing to spend money on it, for he got up from his chair to put the bills on Wolfe's desk.

As Wolfe started to speak the phone rang, and I turned and got it. It was Lucy Hazen. She asked for Wolfe, and I told her to hold it and turned to him. "The woman that brought the sausage this morning wants to know if it will do. If you want to ask Fritz you can talk on the kitchen extension."

"Yes. You said this morning that if I need your services you would see." Her voice was shaky. "I do need them. I'm going to be arrested, and I - "

 some bills to pay."
"But I don't want anything from him! I told you - "
"We're on the phone. The lawyer will join me in that instruction. His name is Nathaniel Parker. Archie, get Mr. Parker. I'll talk from here."

Chapter 4
==> I pushed the button down, released it, dialed Parker's home number, got him, buzzed the kitchen, and Wolfe got on. He gave Parker the necessary facts, and not much more - nothing of what Mrs. Hazen had told us that morning, nothing about the gun. He did say that I had formed the conclusion that she had not shot her husband, and that he had accepted it. Parker was to arrange for bail if she was bailable, if they held her on the big charge he was to get what he could at the DA's office. I waited to hang up until Wolfe was at the office door. He went to his desk, sat, leveled his eyes at Theodore Weed, and spoke. <==
"Now sir. That was timely. It was Mrs. Hazen on the phone. I have sent - "
"Where is she?"
"At the District Attorney's office. She thinks she is going to be held. I have sent a lawyer to her, and I have agreed to act in her behalf. You were assuming that I declined her offer of a check because I thought she was guilty of murder or at least was implicated, but you were wrong. She is now my client." He wiggled a finger at the bills on the desk. "Your money. Take it."
Weed's jaw was hanging, his lips parted. He found words. "But you - I don't see why you - "
"You're not obliged to see and I'm not obliged to explain. Why do you think Mrs. Hazen killed her husband? Was it merely surmise?"

Weed's jaw was hanging, his lips parted. He found words. "But you - I don't see why you - "
"You're not obliged to see and I'm not obliged to explain. Why do you think Mrs. Hazen killed her husband? Was it merely surmise?"
"I don't - I don't think she killed him. She didn't!"
"If I had taken your money what were you going to ask me to do?"
"I don't know exactly. I was going ... to consult you. I wanted to know what you did with the gun. Have the police got it?"
==> Wolfe shook his head. "I am acting for her now, Mr. Weed. You are the enemy - one of them. What if you killed Mr. Hazen, or know who did, and would like to see it imputed to her, and suspecting, for whatever reason, that she left a gun with me this morning, you want to find out? What if you are indeed the enemy?" <==

 sat and stared at him. His jaw started to work again and he stopped it. "Look here," he said. "I want to know something. I know your reputation, I know about you. Is that straight, Mrs. Hazen phoned you just now and you're working for her?"
"It is."
"All right, then this is straight too." He stuck an arm out. "You can cut off this arm if it will help her any. And the other one. If that's corny, okay, that's where I stand."
Wolfe regarded him with narrowed eyes. So did I. He looked as if he meant it, but even if he did, that didn't make him our pal. If he would give an arm to help her, and if he had known how she felt about her husband, he might have taken steps to get rid of him for her, which wouldn't cost him even a finger if he was lucky.

Wolfe made a tent with his fingers, the tips together, his elbows on the chair arms. "Indeed," he said. "I have no use for your arm, but some information might be helpful. When did you last see Mr. Hazen?"
"I want to know where that gun is. I know she left it here, she told me so." "When did she tell you?"
"This afternoon. I was there when she came home."
"What else did she tell you?"
"Not much - there wasn't time. We were interrupted. I knew Hazen had a gun in a drawer in his room, and I had looked to see if it was there and it wasn't, and I asked her if she knew where it was. Have the police got it?"

"My God, no. I doubt if she even told her best friend. Don't think that the way I feel about her made me imagine it. I saw her when he touched her, how she tried to cover up. So that's why I was invited to dinner last night. I don't think he expected or hoped to see me squirm, he didn't have to, he knew how I felt. Of course he was a sadist, but he was a damned subtle one. I was onto him, in a way, after I had been with him a couple of months, but I didn't leave because I ... I had met her."
"And your feeling for her was returned?"
"Certainly not. I was just a guy that worked for her husband." "Rather a forlorn situation for you."

Yeah. That's the right word, forlorn. I told you because you asked why I was there, and I've got a little idea how you work, and you're working for her. Another thing you might want to know, I think there was something screwy about his business. I know the public-relations game is mostly just a high-grade racket, but even so. Take the four people who were there last night. Why did Mrs. Victor Oliver, the sixty-year-old widow of a millionaire broker, pay him two thousand dollars a month? She needs public relations like I need a hole in the head. The same for Mrs. Talbot - twenty-five hundred a month. Maybe her husband, the banker, could use a P.R. expert, granted that there is one, but why her? Jules Khoury's amounts vary, sometimes a couple of thousand, sometimes more. Possibly an inventor likes to stand in well with the public, though I don't see why, and during the time I've been there Khoury has got damn little for his money. Ambrose Perdis is the screwiest of all. For his business, his shipping corporations, he uses one of the big P.R. operators, the Codray Associates, but personally he has paid Hazen more than forty thousand dollars this past year. I'm not supposed to know all this. I got curious and I got at the records one day."
==> Wolfe grunted. "A man who hires another man to forge distinction for him deserves as little as he gets. Are you suggesting that Mr. Hazen extorted those sums?" <==
"I don't know, but he didn't earn them. I admit that very few P.R. operators do earn what they get. If any."
"Did he have any clients other than those four?"
"Sure, about a dozen. Fifteen altogether, as of yesterday. His total take was over a quarter of a million a year."
Wolfe looked up at the clock. "It will be my dinner time in five minutes. If my assumption that Mrs. Hazen didn't kill her husband is correct, and if you didn't, who did?"
That question gets a helpful answer about once in a hundred times.

He was more than willing; the idea appealed to him; but he had to start from scratch, and five minutes wasn't enough. He thought that Wolfe should forget about dinner, though he didn't say so, which was just as well. He said he would return after dinner, but Wolfe said no, if he would leave

Yeah. That's the right word, forlorn. I told you because you asked why I was there, and I've got a little idea how you work, and you're working for her. Another thing you might want to know, I think there was something screwy about his business. I know the public-relations game is mostly just a high-grade racket, but even so. Take the four people who were there last night. Why did Mrs. Victor Oliver, the sixty-year-old widow of a millionaire broker, pay him two thousand dollars a month? She needs public relations like I need a hole in the head. The same for Mrs. Talbot - twenty-five hundred a month. Maybe her husband, the banker, could use a P.R. expert, granted that there is one, but why her? Jules Khoury's amounts vary, sometimes a couple of thousand, sometimes more. Possibly an inventor likes to stand in well with the public, though I don't see why, and during the time I've been there Khoury has got damn little for his money. Ambrose Perdis is the screwiest of all. For his business, his shipping corporations, he uses one of the big P.R. operators, the Codray Associates, but personally he has paid Hazen more than forty thousand dollars this past year. I'm not supposed to know all this. I got curious and I got at the records one day."
Wolfe grunted. "A man who hires another man to forge distinction for him deserves as little as he gets. Are you suggesting that Mr. Hazen extorted those sums?"
"I don't know, but he didn't earn them. I admit that very few P.R. operators do earn what they get. If any."
"Did he have any clients other than those four?"
"Sure, about a dozen. Fifteen altogether, as of yesterday. His total take was over a quarter of a million a year."
==> Wolfe looked up at the clock. "It will be my dinner time in five minutes. If my assumption that Mrs. Hazen didn't kill her husband is correct, and if you didn't, who did?" <==

 his phone number he would hear from us. He would have left the bills there on Wolfe's desk if I hadn't handed them to him.
By the time we had finished dinner and were back in the office, with coffee, I had no personal worry. If the bullets had matched we would have heard from Cramer by then. Wolfe got at the letters to sign, still on his desk, and as he finished the last one and I took it he spoke.
"Did Mr. Weed shoot him?"

==> No. It was a more familiar figure, a tall thin middle-aged man in a dark gray overcoat that had been cut to give him more shoulder, but not overdoing it. Nathaniel Parker had his clothes made by Stover. When I opened the door and greeted and admitted him he headed for the office, keeping his coat on and his homburg in his hand, and I followed. He was one of the eight men, not counting me, that Wolfe shook hands with. He declined Wolfe's invitation to be seated, saying that he was an hour and a half late for a dinner appointment. "I stopped in instead of phoning," he said, "because I had to deliver this." He took a key from his pocket and handed it to me. "That's the key to Mrs. Hazen's house. Also this." From his inside pocket he took a folded paper. "That's authority from her to enter and get something. What you're to get, if you want to, is an iron box - she said iron but I suppose it's tin or steel - that is under the bottom drawer of the chest in Hazen's bedroom. You remove the drawer and pry up the board that it slides in on, and the box is underneath. She doesn't know what's in it. One day about a year ago Hazen lifted the board and showed her the box, and told her <==

 that if he died she was to get the box, have it opened by a locksmith, and bum the contents without looking at them. I thought you might want to have a look, and she is willing. You'll be acting for her, through her attorney."
Wolfe grunted. "I'll use my discretion."
"I know you will. If you don't want to tell me what was in it you'll say it was empty. I'd like to be present when it's opened, but I have an appointment. As for her, what did she tell you this morning?"

Wolfe said no, and he went. I escorted him out, returned to the office, and asked, "Any special instructions?"
"No. Will the police be there?"

"No. You have her authority."
Ever since a difficulty I got into some years ago I have made it a practice to have a gun along when I am on an errand that may interfere with a murderer's program. I took off my jacket, got a shoulder holster and a Mariey, which I loaded, from the drawer, put them where they belonged, put the jacket back on, checked that Lucy's key was in a pocket and her authority in another one, and went to the hall for my coat and hat.

Chapter 5
==> I stood across the street from the Hazen house, on 37th Street between Park and Lexington, for a look. It was brick, painted gray with green trim, four stories, narrower than Wolfe's brownstone, with the entrance three steps down from the sidewalk. I noted those details just for the record, but they weren't important. What was important was that there was a tiny sliver of light at the lower part of the right edge of one of the three windows on the third floor - a sliver that you might leave if you weren't quite thorough enough when you arranged a drape. <==
I didn't know where Hazen's room was; that could be it. It could be a Homicide man looking things over, but it wasn't probable; they had had ten hours. It could be the maid who slept in, but why, at 9:30 at night? Her room certainly wasn't third floor front. Whoever it was and whatever he was doing, I decided not to interrupt him by ringing. I crossed over, descended the three steps, used the key, opened the door with care, entered, closed it with more care, and stood and listened while my eyes adjusted to the dark. For half a minute there was no sound from any direction; then there was something like a bump from up above, followed by a voice, male, very faint. Unless he was talking to himself there was more than one. Thinking there might be occasion for activity, I took off my overcoat and put it on the floor, and my hat, and then tiptoed along the hall, feeling my way, found the stairs, and started up.
Halfway up I stopped. Had there been another voice, a soprano? There had. There was. Then the baritone again. I went on up, with more care now and slower, keeping to the end of the steps next the wall. In the hall on the second floor there was a little light coming from above, enough to catch outlines. Up the second flight I went even slower, since each step might bring me within range. The voices had stopped, but there were tapping sounds. On the fourth step I could get my eyes to the level of the floor by stretching. The hall was the same as the floor below, and the light was coming from a half-open door at its front end. All I could see inside was a chair and part of a bed and drapes over a window, and the back of a woman's head over the back of the chair, silvery hair under a black pancake hat.
I might have stayed put until the voices came again, and now I could get words, but a staircase is not a good tactical position, the light was on them, not me, and at the top I would be nearly out of range through the opening. I moved. As I put

 my weight on the next to last step the tapping stopped and the baritone came.

"Hold it. I'm giving you a break. Shall I come and slap you with the gun? Turn around."
He turned. A leather case from the bag was stuffed with credentials - driver's license, credit cards, others.
Some of them said Anne Talbot and others Mrs. Henry Lewis Talbot. That was the young woman, whose attractions, both from the front and the rear, were so obvious that they had caught my eye even though my eyes were busy. There was a leather keyfold and I snapped it open to inspect the keys, and compared one of them with the key to the house which I had in my pocket. It didn't match. I returned the items to the bag one by one and picked up the other bag and dumped it.
The woman with silvery hair was Mrs. Victor Oliver.
There was no key in her bag like the one I had, and nothing of interest. I examined the pockets of the coats, all four of them, and found no key.
==> As I stepped around the end of the bed I allowed myself a grin at a detail I had observed; they all had gloves on - not rubber ones secured for the occasion, just gloves. "Now that I know your names," I said, "it's only fair that you should know mine. Archie Goodwin. I work for a man you may have heard of, Nero Wolfe, the private detective. He has been hired by Mrs. Barry Hazen, and I have her key to the house and her written authority to enter. I need to know which one of you has a key and I'm going to find out. You may turn around, but stay where you are. You will take off your clothes and pile them on the floor, including your shoes and socks or stockings, but I think not your underwear. I'll see." <==
They were facing me at four paces. Anne Talbot said,
"I won't. It's outrageous." She was extremely easy to look at.
"Pooh," I said. "Pretend you're at the beach or a pool. Do you want me to peel you? Don't think I wouldn't."
"We have no key," Mrs. Oliver said. She was easy to look away from, with her flabby jowl and little yellow eyes set deep. "The maid let us in. She has gone out, but when she comes back you can ask her."

"He's Archie Goodwin," Anne Talbot said. "I've seen him at the Flamingo." "You are a private detective," Perdis said.
"Right."
"Then you do things for money. We will pay you fifty thousand dollars if you will leave this house and forget that you have been here. Half of it in cash tomorrow morning and the other half later. We will give you a satisfactory guarantee, perhaps something in writing."
"How much later?"
"That's hard to say. It is delicate. We would need to be sure of your forgetting until certain difficulties have ended."
==> "That's pretty vague. Get your clothes on and we'll see." I picked up the phone and dialed, and he started toward me. I showed the gun, but he kept coming, saying something, and I dropped the phone and moved to meet him, and damned if he didn't swerve around me and dart for the phone. I had intended to tap him with the gun, not caring for bruised knuckles, but his swerve got him on the wrong side, so I took him from behind, with my left arm hooked under his chin and my hip at his rump, and levered him up and over. He landed on his hands and knees nine feet away. I said, "Cut out the horseplay and put your pants on," and went to the phone and dialed. After nine buzzes Wolfe's voice came. <==
"Yes?"
"Me. Could we use fifty grand?" A grunt. "In the box?"
"No. I haven't got it yet. I'm in Hazen's bedroom. There are four people with me, two men and two women, lined up against the wall. The four that came to dinner last night. They were in this room looking for something and hadn't found it. Perdis just off -"

One of them has Hazen's key."

"No. I had them strip and went through their clothes. They say the maid let them in. She's not here; of course they greased her. Perdis just offered me fifty grand to go away and forget I was here. I'll split it with you. He would probably double it."
"Pfui. Are you intact?"
"Sure. I'm calling just to tell you to expect us, say in half an hour, maybe less."
Silence. He would have to work, not tomorrow, but now - and two women. Then: "I suppose I must," and he hung up.
Perdis had joined the others at the wall. As I cradled the phone he spoke. "We will double it. One hundred thousand dollars."
==> "Skip it." I moved to the foot of the bed. "What would I tell my wife if I had one? You heard me tell Nero Wolfe to expect us in half an hour, but you have a choice. You can leave and go your ways and try to forget you were here, and I'll phone Inspector Cramer and report this incident, omitting nothing. Or you can come and talk it over with Nero Wolfe, and he may or may not care to bother Cramer about it. You may have two minutes to consider it." I looked at my wrist. <==
"Listen, Mr. Goodwin," Anne Talbot said. She had her clothes on, and with or without them she was highly ornamental. "We were looking for something that belongs to us. We're not thieves. We're respectable - "
I cut her off. "Sorry, but don't waste it on me. I just run errands. It's either Nero Wolfe or the police. If you pick Nero Wolfe there will be a slight delay because I have a little chore to do in this room. You will take your things and go downstairs and on out, and get two taxis. You will get into one of the taxis and wait there in front of the house, and have the other one there for me. I'll be down soon, probably in a couple of minutes. There's one complication: if you split and one or two of you prefer to go somewhere else, I'll phone the police immediately. I would rather not, but I'd have to."
Two of them, Perdis and Mrs. Oliver, started to speak, but I shut them off and moved away from the bed. Anne Talbot went to the bed and got her coat, and Khoury went and held it for her, and then got his own. Anne Talbot said to Perdis and Mrs. Oliver, "Is there any alternative?" Perdis went and got Mrs.

 Oliver's coat and took it to her, and she went to the bed for her bag.

Perdis went and got Mrs.

 Oliver's coat and took it to her, and she went to the bed for her bag.
Perdis was the last one out. When he had started down the stairs I shut the door, put a chair against it, went to the chest of drawers, a big heavy piece at the left wall, and took out the bottom drawer. There was a folded blanket in it. I squatted at the opening. The board that the drawer slid on, solid, not a plywood panel, was flush and snugly fitted, no play to it. I tried to get its edge with my thumbnails; nothing doing. I got out my pocketknife, stuck the point of the blade in the crack at the center, just barely in, pried gently, and up it came. The front edge of the board was beveled. Very neat. I put my hand in, felt metal, got a finger under, and here came the box. It was steel, anything but flimsy, twelve inches by six and about two inches deep, and weighed a good four pounds, with a lock not to be opened with a nail file. I shook it and heard no movement, which didn't prove anything. With the board down, I replaced the drawer, moved the chair away from the door and opened it, and went to the head of the stairs. No sound of voices from below. If I had gone down and joined them in the hall carrying a steel box which I must have found in Hazen's room they would have made quite a party of it. I descended a flight, stood to listen half a minute, and went on down. They had turned on the light in the lower hall. My hat and coat were there on the floor. I put the Marley in the holster, put on the hat and coat, slipped the box under the coat, with my hand in my pocket holding it, turned out the light, and opened the door.
They had followed instructions to a T. Two taxis were there, and they were in the one in the rear, all four of them. After glancing in I told the driver to follow my taxi, went and got in and gave the driver the address, and we rolled.

Perdis was the last one out. When he had started down the stairs I shut the door, put a chair against it, went to the chest of drawers, a big heavy piece at the left wall, and took out the bottom drawer. There was a folded blanket in it. I squatted at the opening. The board that the drawer slid on, solid, not a plywood panel, was flush and snugly fitted, no play to it. I tried to get its edge with my thumbnails; nothing doing. I got out my pocketknife, stuck the point of the blade in the crack at the center, just barely in, pried gently, and up it came. The front edge of the board was beveled. Very neat. I put my hand in, felt metal, got a finger under, and here came the box. It was steel, anything but flimsy, twelve inches by six and about two inches deep, and weighed a good four pounds, with a lock not to be opened with a nail file. I shook it and heard no movement, which didn't prove anything. With the board down, I replaced the drawer, moved the chair away from the door and opened it, and went to the head of the stairs. No sound of voices from below. If I had gone down and joined them in the hall carrying a steel box which I must have found in Hazen's room they would have made quite a party of it.

Chapter 6
When you mount the seven steps to the stoop and enter the hall of the old
==> brownstone on West 35th Street, the first door on your left is to what we call the front room, with the office door farther along on that side. The walls and doors of the front room and office are soundproofed. After convoying the company to the front room and telling them they wouldn't have to wait long, I returned to the hall, put my hat and coat on the rack, proceeded to the office, and put the box on Wolfe's desk pad. <==
"Good timing," I said. "In another hour or two they would probably have found it."
He reached to pass his fingertips along its edge. "You haven't opened it."
"No. It's a good lock. They're in the front room, all four. I gave them their pick, you or the cops, and they preferred you. There's nothing to add to what I told you on the phone. Before I open it I want to register a guess. Not that it's what Hazen had on them, that's a cinch. My guess is specifically what he had on Mrs. Oliver. She murdered her husband. Wait till you see her."
He made a face. "This will be distasteful. Bring keys."
I went to the cabinet at the far wall, opened a drawer, and made selections. Although I couldn't qualify on the witness stand as a lock expert, I know a Hotchkiss from a Euler, and I can open your suitcase with a paper clip if you'll be patient. Moving the box to my desk, I sat and started in. I had selected four types, little boxes of assortments. In three minutes I eliminated the first type, and in another three the second one. The third seemed more promising, and I was getting hot when

As he spoke it clicked and I had it. I raised the lid. The box was empty. I upended it for Wolfe to see. "Yeah," I said. "It sure is distasteful."
He took in air, about a bushel, and let it out again.
"It's just as well. It would probably have presented us with a problem. More than

 one. I presume he decided it was a mistake to tell his wife of it and removed the contents. Elsewhere in the house?"

"It's just as well. It would probably have presented us with a problem. More than

 one. I presume he decided it was a mistake to tell his wife of it and removed the contents. Elsewhere in the house?"
"I doubt it."
"So do I." He leaned back, closed his eyes, and pushed his lips out. In a moment he pulled them in, and then out and in, out and in. He was working. A minute passed, two minutes, three.... He opened his eyes and straightened up. "Lock the box and leave it on your desk. Put the keys away. Have a gun in your hand when you admit them, and go to your desk and stay there. Proceed."
==> I proceeded. After locking the box and returning the keys to the cabinet, I moved four of the yellow chairs up, in a row facing Wolfe's desk, got the gun out, opened the door to the front room, and invited them to enter. <==
The gentlemen followed the ladies. I went to my desk and pronounced names, and when they were seated I sat, with the gun in my hand resting on my thigh.
Wolfe's eyes went right and then left. "This shouldn't take long," he said. "First the situation. I shall not resort to euphemism. You were being blackmailed by Mr. Hazen, either collectively - please don't interrupt. Either collectively or separately. He had other victims, but you four alone were paying him around a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year, ostensibly for professional services, but that was merely a subterfuge. I don't know whether the police know that or not, probably not, but I do. If there was any doubt it was removed when Mr. Goodwin found you in that house surreptitiously, looking for something, and you offered him a large sum of money. So much - "
"I didn't," Mrs. Oliver blurted. "Mr. Perdis did."
"Pfui. You were there. Did you object? So much for that. I am acting for my client, Mrs. Hazen. She is being held under suspicion of killing her husband, and has given me certain information. This is one item: one day about a year ago her husband showed her a box, a metal box, he had in his bedroom. To show it to her he removed the bottom drawer of a chest and pried up the board the drawer slid on, and the box was underneath the board. He told her that if he died she should get the box, have it opened by a locksmith, and burn the contents without looking at them. It was to get that box that Mr. Goodwin went there this evening, with Mrs. Hazen's key and authority. After you left the room he removed the drawer and lifted the board, and got it. It's there on his desk."

That was like him. I hadn't told him that I had sent them from the room before I got it, and that they hadn't seen it; he took it for granted. I appreciate his compliments, but some day he may overestimate me. I had no idea where or what he was headed for, but I thought a little gesture wouldn't hurt, so I got the box with my left hand, the gun being in my right, and displayed it.

==> Four pairs of eyes were on it, glued to it. Anne Talbot mumbled something. Perdis started up, thought better of it, and sank back. Jules Khoury muttered, "So it was there." I had the gun, but there were four of them, so I got up, detoured around them to the safe, opened the safe door, put the box in, closed the door, and spun the knob. As I returned to my chair Wolfe was speaking. <==
"I have a proposal to make, but first a question or two. My objective, of course, is to demonstrate that Mrs. Hazen did not kill her husband. Yesterday evening you dined at her table. After dinner she went to her room, and soon after that Mr. Weed left. I'm not going to ask about the sequence and the times of your departures, or where you went and what you did; the police have got all that from you, and if the matter can be resolved by such details they are extremely competent at that sort of thing, and they are ahead of me, with an army. But I want to know about your conversation with Mr. Hazen after his wife and Mr. Weed left. What was said?"
"Nothing," Khoury declared.
"Nonsense. Mr. Hazen had told his wife he was going to discuss something with you. What?"
"Nothing of any importance. He opened champagne. We discussed the stock market. He asked Mrs. Talbot what plays she had seen. He got Perdis talking about ships."
"He talked about poisons," Perdis said.

"Nothing of any importance. He opened champagne. We discussed the stock market. He asked Mrs. Talbot what plays she had seen. He got Perdis talking about ships."
"He talked about poisons," Perdis said.
"He talked about his wife's father," Mrs. Oliver said. "He said his wife's father was a great inventor, a genius."
==> Wolfe scowled at them. "This is egregious. If he discussed some aspect of his peculiar relations with you, naturally you didn't tell the police about it. But I know of those relations and the police don't. I intend to know what was said." <==


"You don't understand, Mr. Wolfe." It was Anne Talbot. She was leaning forward, appealing to him. "You didn't know him. He was a monster. He was a demon. He didn't want to discuss anything, he just wanted to have us there together, and we had to go. It was his special kind of torture. He wanted each of us to know about the others and to know that the others knew about us. He liked to see us trying to act as if it were just a ... just a dinner party. You didn't know him."
"He was a devil," Perdis said.
Wolfe surveyed them. "Did he reveal to any of you the nature of his hold on the others, last evening or any other time? Or hint at it?"

Anne Talbot and Khoury shook their heads. Mrs. Oliver said, "No, oh, no." Perdis said, "I think he hinted. For instance, poison. I thought he hinted."
"But no particulars?" "No."
"I must concede that he was not an estimable man. Very well, he is dead, and here we are. As I said, I have a proposal. It is highly likely, all but certain, that he kept in that box whatever support he had for his demands on you. The box is in my safe. I don't desire or intend to inspect its contents. But Mrs. Hazen is my client and I am committed to protect both her person and her property. She is not bound to follow her husband's instructions to bum the contents of the box, and it would be quixotic to destroy anything so valuable. I will surrender it to you, you four, for one million dollars."

They gawked at him.
"That's a large sum, but it is not exorbitant. In another seven years, if Mr. Hazen had lived, you would have paid him more than that, and that wouldn't have ended it. This will; this will be final. If I left it to you to apportion the burden you would probably haggle, and time is short, so I shall expect one quarter of the million from each of you, either in currency or certified checks, within twenty- four hours. There is no question of extortion by Mrs. Hazen or me; we haven't seen the contents of the box; I only say, as her agent, you may have them at that price if you want them."

"You haven't opened the box," Perdis said. "No, I haven't."
"What if it's empty?"
==> "You get nothing and you pay nothing." Wolfe looked up at the clock. "The box will be opened here tomorrow at midnight, with all of you present, or earlier if and when you meet the terms. If it is empty, so much for that. If it isn't, there will of course be a difficulty. None of you will want the others to inspect the items that pertain to him. I don't want to look at any of them. I suggest that Mr. Goodwin, who is thoroughly discreet, may remove the items singly, examine each one only enough to determine whom it applies to, and hand it over. If you have a better procedure to suggest, do so." <==
Mrs. Oliver was licking her lips and swallowing, by turns. Perdis was hunched over, his lips tight, his heavy broad shoulders rising and falling with his breathing. Khoury had his chin up, his narrowed eyes aimed at Wolfe past the tip of his long thin nose. Anne Talbot's eyes were closed, and a muscle at the side of her pretty neck was twitching.
"I realize," Wolfe said, "that it may not be easy to produce so large a sum in so short a time, but it is not impossible, and I dare not give you longer. While it is true that the box and its contents are the property of Mrs. Hazen, the police would no doubt regard it as evidential in their investigation of a murder, and I can't undertake to withhold my knowledge of it longer than twenty-four hours." He pushed his chair back and rose.
"I shall await your pleasure."
But if he was through they weren't. Mrs. Oliver wanted the box opened then and there, and a display of its contents by me. Khoury said that there was a question of extortion, that they were being told to fork over a million dollars in twenty- four hours or else. Perdis demanded that they be given the time and opportunity to talk with Mrs. Hazen, but of course she was in the coop. Anne Talbot was the only one who had nothing to say; she was on her feet, gripping the back of the chair, the muscle in her neck still twitching. Thinking it might help if I went and brought their coats, I did so, and it took Anne Talbot three tries to find the armhole.

But if he was through they weren't. Mrs. Oliver wanted the box opened then and there, and a display of its contents by me. Khoury said that there was a question of extortion, that they were being told to fork over a million dollars in twenty- four hours or else. Perdis demanded that they be given the time and opportunity to talk with Mrs. Hazen, but of course she was in the coop. Anne Talbot was the only one who had nothing to say; she was on her feet, gripping the back of the chair, the muscle in her neck still twitching. Thinking it might help if I went and brought their coats, I did so, and it took Anne Talbot three tries to find the armhole.


==> When they were out, and the door shut, and I returned to the office, Wolfe was out from behind his desk. <==
"A notion," I said. "Mrs. Hazen may be out on bail by the middle of the morning and accessible to them, and you're up in the plant rooms until eleven o'clock, not to be disturbed. Even if she's locked up, those people have lawyers and connections, Perdis especially. He may play poker with the DA. I could phone Parker to see her in the morning and tell her that no matter what she hears you're not loony, you're just a genius, and you know where you're headed for even when nobody else does, including me."
"Not necessary." He went to the door and turned.
"Make sure that the safe's locked. I'm tired. Good night."
He knows darned well that I always make sure the safe's locked, but of course it doesn't often have something in it that's supposed to be worth a million bucks.
Up in my room on the third floor, as I undressed I made assorted tries at deciding what was next on his program, and didn't like any of them. As it turned out the next thing on the program wasn't decided either by me or by him, but by Inspector Cramer. In the morning Wolfe came down from the plant rooms at eleven o'clock as usual, and also as usual I had the mail opened and the dusting done and fresh water in the vase on his desk. He went first to the front of the desk to put a spray of orchids in the vase, Odontoglossum pyramus, then circled around to his chair. As he sat the doorbell rang. I went to the office door for a look and told him it was Cramer. He slapped a palm on the desk, glared at me, and said nothing, and I went to the front and opened up. I didn't like the look on Cramer's face as he entered and let me take his coat and hat. He almost grinned at me, and he didn't stride to the office, he just walked. He sat in the red leather chair, crossed his legs comfortably, and told Wolfe, "I haven't got much time. I want to hear it from you, what Mrs. Hazen came to you for yesterday, just the substance, and then Goodwin will come downtown and get it down in a statement, all of it. With his wonderful memory."

Wolfe was glowering at him. "Mr. Cramer. It shouldn't be - "
"Save it. She's booked for murder. We have the gun. Hazen got his car from the garage Monday night. It has been found parked on Twenty-first Street. There

 was a gun in the dashboard compartment, and it fired the bullet that killed him. We have traced it. It was bought by Hazen six years ago and he had a permit for it. He kept it in a drawer in his bedroom, and the maid saw it there yesterday morning when she went up to see why he hadn't come down for breakfast. Don't ask me why Mrs. Hazen took it from there afterwards and went to where she had parked the car on Twenty-first Street and put it in the car. I don't know, but maybe you do. So let's hear you."

==> I squeezed my eyes shut because if I had kept them open they would have popped, and I didn't want to give Cramer that satisfaction. But I am supposed to help Wolfe when he needs it, and right then he sure could use a few seconds to arrange his mind, so I opened my eyes and asked Cramer, just curious, "What kind of a gun?" <==
He ignored it. He was having too good a time looking at Wolfe to bother with me. Wolfe was paying me another compliment. I was responsible for our assumption that Mrs. Hazen was innocent, but he didn't glance at me. He lowered his chin, scratched the tip of his nose, regarded Cramer for ten seconds, and then turned to me.
"Archie. It may be desirable to have a record of what Mr. Cramer just said. Type it. Verbatim. Double-spaced, one carbon."
As I got at the typewriter Cramer said, "I don't object. Naturally you've got to stall while you try to figure a way to climb down without breaking your neck."
No comment from Wolfe. I put in paper and hit the keys. Since I had had years of practice reporting long and involved conversations that had had time to fade, that one was no trick at all. As I rolled the paper out Wolfe said, "Initial the original," and I did so, and handed it to him. He read it through, in no hurry, took his pen and initialed it, handed it back to me, and turned to Cramer.
"I'm not stalling," he said. "If what you just told me is true, your demand for information is warranted. If it isn't true you're gulling me into disclosing a confidential communication from a client, and I want a record - "

"She is now. She wasn't when you were here yesterday, but she hired me later through Mr. Parker. I want a record of your words, and I have it. I also want more facts, to make sure that those you have given me are not qualified by others. That's a reasonable precaution, I think. What time did Mr. Hazen take his car from the garage Monday evening?"
"A little after eleven o'clock."

"Have you any additional facts implicating Mrs. Hazen, of any kind? Not conjectures, facts. For example, was she seen in or near the car, driving it, or when it was parked on Twenty-first Street during the night, or when - as you have it - she went there yesterday to put the gun in the dashboard compartment?"
"No. No more facts. I expect to get some from you."
"You will. Naturally, when you learned that Mrs. Hazen had been to see me you focused on her, but surely not exclusively. Have you inquired into the movements of the dinner guests after they left?"
"Yes."
"Have any of them been conclusively eliminated?" "No. Not conclusively."
==> Wolfe closed his eyes. In a moment he opened them. <==
"That seems to cover it." He took a breath. "Of course I don't like this. And you're not squeezing it out of me, though you think you are. I would tell you nothing and take the consequences if it weren't that I need some information that I can get only from you. I have to know where the gun came from that Mrs.

 Hazen left with me yesterday. If you'll agree - "
"She left a gun with you?"
"Yes. I'll tell you about it, and give it to you, if you will give me its history at the earliest possible moment. I want your word."

==> Wolfe shook his head. "No. It's evidence in my investigation, but not in yours. You have your gun, the one the murderer used. How can it embarrass you to tell me about this one?" <==
Cramer considered it. "You're going to tell me what she said about it." "I am."
"Okay. Go ahead."
"I have your word?"
"Yes."
"Get the gun, Archie."

"Drexel thirty-two."
"So's this." I handed it to him. "Of course there are millions of Drexel thirty- twos."
He gave it a look, and darned if he didn't sniff it. As I said, that's automatic. Also he flipped the cylinder open for a glance.


==> "It was fired yesterday," Wolfe said, "by Mr. Goodwin, to get a bullet. The bullet I gave you." <==
Cramer nodded. "Yeah. There's nothing on God's earth you wouldn't do. It could have been ... What the hell, it wasn't. Okay, let's hear you."
Wolfe unloaded. He didn't enjoy it and neither did I, spilling it, but we had to know about the gun and it might have taken us days. He skipped the details, including no quotes, but gave it straight, both parts, before the news came over the radio and after. He didn't include my reasons for deciding that she hadn't shot her husband, but I didn't mind; it might have got Cramer confused and that would have been a pity. He was a little confused anyhow; toward the end he was frowning, pulling at his lip now and then, a wary look in his eyes. When Wolfe finished he sat looking at it before he spoke.
"What have you left out?" he demanded.
Wolfe shook his head. "Nothing material. You said you wanted the substance; you have it. How long will it take to trace the gun?"
"I don't get it. After she came to you with that fairy tale, and the news came about her husband, and you learned that we were holding her, you took her for a client? I don't get it. I have never known you to take a murderer for a client. Whether it's just your goddamn luck, or what, I don't know, but you haven't. Why did you take her?"

hapter 8
During the next nine hours I had various opportunities to try to sort it out. En route in a police car to the DA's office, later from there to Homicide West on 20th Street, and several waiting periods while assorted officers of the law, including the DA himself at one point, decided what to do next.
It was complicated enough even before an assistant DA kindly permitted me to use a phone, around three o'clock, and I called Wolfe. Of course the game was button, button, who had the gun when and where?

"I shall sign no statement. I am not obliged to. If you send a man he won't be admitted. If you have questions, ask them."
Cramer's round red face got redder. But that was as far as it went; his memory of what had happened on the three occasions he had taken Wolfe downtown was

 presumably what stopped him. He stuck the gun in his pocket and turned to me. "Come on, Goodwin. We'll see."
As I arose the phone rang and I reached to get it. It was Nathaniel Parker. He was upset. "Archie? Nat Parker. Mrs. Hazen is being held on a charge of homicide, of course without bail. I want to see Wolfe before I see her. I have to know what she told him yesterday. I'll be there in twenty minutes."
==> "Fine," I said. "He's in a perfect mood for it. Come ahead." I hung up, told Wolfe, "Parker will be here in twenty minutes," and went to the hall for my coat and hat, with Cramer at my heels. <==

Either gun. If Lucy Hazen had lied, how much? Had the gun that the maid had seen in the drawer Tuesday morning been the one that had shot Hazen or the one she had brought to Wolfe? If the former, Lucy was a liar and also either was a murderer or could name him. If the latter, who had put it in the drawer and when? And why? It wasn't that there were no possible answers; there were too many. And too many of them made it too likely that Lucy had made a monkey of me and therefore were not acceptable.

The first hour or so I was entertained by an assistant DA named Mandel, who was not a stranger to me, and a Homicide Bureau lieutenant, and it was obvious that the gun puzzle was as tough for them as it was for me, though they didn't say so. Then, while we were having sandwiches and coffee, no recess called, at Mandel's desk, a phone call came for him, and he took the lieutenant to another room, and when they returned their attitude was quite different. Apparently they were no longer interested in guns; they concentrated on what Lucy had said to Wolfe and me, her exact words; and finally, a little before three o'clock, Mandel called a stenographer in and told me to start dictating my statement. Of course the room was wired for sound, and they would have fun later comparing my dictated statement with what I had told them. It was then that I insisted on making a phone call and was escorted to a booth.
I got Wolfe. "Me. In a booth at the DA's office, and it may be tapped. They should be finished with me by the end of the week. They were curious about guns, and then a phone call came and they weren't. I thought you might like to know."
"I already know." He didn't sound depressed. "Mr. Cramer phoned shortly after one. The gun we gave him had been traced without difficulty. It was purchased

I told Wolfe I might or might not be home for dinner. <==
Dictating my statement to the stenographer, I had to keep jerking my mind back to it. The gun puzzle was okay now for the cops, since they had tagged Lucy; now they didn't have to buy it that she had been nutty enough to take the gun home after she shot him and put it in the drawer, and the next day get it and take it back to the car. It was much neater. She had got the gun from the drawer Monday, put the one she had, that had been her father's, in its place, and left it in the car after she shot him. And Tuesday she had got the gun from the drawer and brought it to Wolfe as a prop for her fairy tale, evidently not knowing that guns have numbers that can be traced. What better could you ask for?
But for me, unless I was ready to give Lucy up as a bad job, it was what worse could I ask for. Before, there had been too many answers; now there weren't any. I had to file it while I dictated my statement, in which I was supposed to include everything Lucy had said to us in Wolfe's office, and while I went over it after it was typed, and it wasn't easy. Then I was taken to the office of the DA himself, and he and Mandel pecked at me for an hour; and when they finished, around 6:30, and I supposed that was all for the day, I was informed that Cramer wanted me at Homicide West. If I had balked they would have booked me as a material witness and Parker couldn't come to the rescue until morning, so I took it.
In one respect it was an improvement. The dick at Homicide West whom Cramer sent for sandwiches happened to be civilized enough to think that even a dog has a right to eat what he likes, and I got what I asked for, corned beef on rye and milk. Except for that, it was just more of the same, for more than two hours with Cramer and Sergeant Purley Stebbins. I didn't even have the satisfaction of getting a chance to break my record with Lieutenant Rowcliff. I once got him

 stuttering in two minutes and twenty seconds, and I have a bet with Saul Panzer that I can do it in two minutes flat with three more tries.

I stood on the sidewalk for three good breaths of the cold fresh air, giving my lungs a treat and deciding which way to turn. If right, toward Eighth Avenue, it would be for a taxi; if left, toward Ninth, it would be for a fifteen-minute walk. Voting for the walk, I moved, and had taken three steps when my shoulder was grabbed and yanked from behind and a voice came, with feeling: "You dirty rat!"

The yank had turned me some and I turned myself the rest of the way. It was Theodore Weed. His hands were fists, and the right one was back a foot, with the elbow bent. His eyes were blazing and his bony jaw was set.

==> "You know why. You're a filthy stool, and Nero Wolfe too. You're working for Lucy? You are like hell. You gave the police the gun." <==
"How do you know we did?"
"Things they asked me. Do you deny it?"
My brain was a little tired after the long day, but it was doing its best. This character was by no means crossed off. We only had his word for it that he would give both arms to help Lucy; he had said himself that she didn't know how he felt about her. A chat with him wouldn't hurt and might help, but I couldn't take him home with me until I knew what Wolfe had on his program, if anything.
He still had fists. "I'll tell you what," I said. "We'll go around the corner to Jake's and I'll buy you a drink and we'll discuss it. Then if you still want to take a poke at me Jake will let us use the back room provided we let him watch. Afterwards you can comb your hair if you're up to it. It needs it."
It didn't appeal to him, but what would have? A couple of passersby, noticing his

 stance and his fists, had stopped to see, and a harness bull, emerging from the station, had also stopped. So he came.
At Jake's, when we had sat at a table by the wall and given our orders to the white apron, and I said I had to make a phone call, he got up and came along to the booth. Very bad manners, but I didn't correct him. I even let him stand in the door of the booth so I couldn't close it. I dialed a number and got it.

I'm buying him a drink, but I thought you might like to apologize to him personally for tossing our client to the wolves. He has blood in his eye."
"No. Come home at once." "You have Saul."
"Not here. I need you. Mrs. Oliver and Mr. Perdis are in the front room. Mrs. Oliver has been here since seven o'clock. Mr. Khoury will arrive at any moment. I have been pestered by this confounded telephone all day. Mrs. Talbot called for the fifth time half an hour ago to say that she hopes to be here by ten o'clock, and it's nearly that now. On second thought, bring Mr. Weed. I have a question for him."
"You'll have to bulldog him first."
"Pfui. Bring him. How soon will you be here?"
==> I told him fifteen minutes, and hung up. "No time for a drink," I told Weed. "Nor for a floor show, with me on the floor. Mr. Wolfe wants me. You may came along if you care to." <==
"I was going there," he said grimly, "when I saw you."
"Good. But take it easy. He has a knife in his belt that he uses to stab people in the back."

On the way out I handed the white apron, whose name was Gil, a couple of ones. Outside, we flagged a taxi, and as it rolled uptown I undertook to straighten him out. "Look at it," I said. "If we're stools and selling her to the cops there's not much of anything you can do but shoot us, and even that wouldn't help her any. The fact is, we're with her and you're not. We know she didn't kill her husband. Either you thought she had and probably still do, or you killed him yourself. If the former, your feeling for her has got a smudge. If the latter, you did a swell job, handling it so that she gets the credit for it. Go soak your head."
"Why did you give the police the gun?"

"Good for you. We appreciate it."
"And I didn't."
"That's not so important, but we'll keep it in mind."
At the curb in front of the old brownstone there was a black limousine with a chauffeur in it. That would be Mrs. Oliver's. Mounting the seven steps to the stoop, I used my key, but the chain bolt was on and I had to ring for Fritz. As he took Weed's coat and I disposed of mine, he said, "Thank God, Archie, thank God," and I asked him what for, and he said, "For you. It has been very bad. Three phone calls during dinner, and that woman was in the front room."
"I can imagine. How many are in there now?" "Three. Her and two men."
==> So Khoury had come. I took Weed to the office. Wolfe was at his desk with a book. Weed headed for him, talking. "I want to know why - " <==
"Shut up!" Wolfe bellowed.
Wolfe's bellow would stop a tiger ready to spring.
Weed stood and glared at him. Wolfe finished a paragraph, inserted his marker,

 put the book down, and issued a command. "Sit down. I prefer eyes at my level. Sit down! When you arrived at the Hazens' for dinner Monday evening were the others already there?"

"And I didn't."
"That's not so important, but we'll keep it in mind."
At the curb in front of the old brownstone there was a black limousine with a chauffeur in it. That would be Mrs. Oliver's. Mounting the seven steps to the stoop, I used my key, but the chain bolt was on and I had to ring for Fritz.

Five of the yellow chairs were there. Weed took the nearest one. He ran his fingers through his mop of hair, but only a comb and brush could have handled it. "Mrs. Oliver was there," he said. "And Khoury. Perdis and Mrs. Talbot came soon after I did. I don't see why - "

The doorbell rang. I went to the hall, but Fritz was there opening the door. When the newcomer had crossed the sill I stepped back into the office and gave Wolfe a nod, and he asked, "Mrs. Talbot?"
"Yes, sir."
"Mr. Weed to the hall, then bring them in, and Mr. Weed to the front room. We may need him later."
"I'm staying right here," Weed declared, "until I - "
"You are not. I have work to do and no time to bicker with you. Out. Out!" "But damn it - "

Weed looked at me, standing at the door. What he met was a stony gaze. He got up and came, past me and into the hall. When he was four paces along I went and opened the door to the front room.

Chapter 9
I put Anne Talbot in the chair nearest me because from her face and the way she moved it seemed likely that she might need smelling salts any minute, and there were some in my drawer. Next to her was Jules Khoury, then Mrs. Oliver, and then Ambrose Perdis. I had expected remarks as they entered, especially from Mrs. Oliver, who had been waiting more than three hours, but there hadn't been a peep from anyone. I felt like an usher at a funeral.
==> Wolfe took them in. "Since you are here," he said, "I assume that you are prepared to act on my proposal. <==
Mrs. Oliver?"'
I had her in profile and couldn't see her deep-set yellow eyes, and from that angle her sagging jowl was even less attractive. She opened her bag and took out a slip of paper. "This is a cashier's check," she said, "on the Knickerbocker Trust Company for two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, made out to me. I'll endorse it. Or I won't."
"That will of course depend. Mrs. Talbot?"
Anne Talbot's lips parted but no sound came. She tried again and got it out. "I have a certified check for sixty-five thousand dollars and forty thousand dollars in cash. I'll pay the rest as soon as I can - I think I can pay it in a month, but it might take longer. Of course you'll want me to sign something, a note, whatever you say, I tried - " She had to swallow. "I tried - " Another swallow. "I did the best I could."
"Mr. Perdis?"

"I have nothing."


"Indeed. Then why are you here?"
"I want to know what's in the box. If there's anything worth a quarter of a million to me, I'll buy it."
==> "The deadline is midnight." Wolfe glanced at the clock. "You would have ninety minutes." <==
"I don't think so. I don't think Mrs. Hazen knows about this. I think you're putting the screws on us without her knowledge. Whatever you're doing, I want to know what's in the box."
"Well." Wolfe's eyes left him to take in the others. "This situation was not covered by the terms of my proposal. Two of you are prepared to comply with the terms and should not suffer for Mr. Khoury's dissent. As for you, Mrs. Talbot, I am willing to accept your declaration of good faith, that you have done your best. You will of course commit yourself in writing to pay the balance. As for you, Mr. Khoury, if you are willful so am I. Whatever the box contains that relates to you will be turned over to the police at midnight. Archie, get the box and the key." Back to them: "We have procured a key that will serve."
Thinking it desirable to keep up appearances, I first got a Marley from the drawer and loaded it. Then to the cabinet for the key, and then to the safe. As I worked the combination my back was to them, but as I opened the door and took out the box I had an eye on them, not only for appearances. It was conceivable that Perdis or Khoury, or both, had come with the idea of getting something for nothing if a chance offered. All four of them had twisted around in their chairs to follow me, and they twisted back as I circled around to Wolfe's desk. As I was putting the box down the phone rang. It would. I was going to tell Wolfe to take it, but didn't have to.
He lifted the receiver. "Yes? ... Yes, Saul ... indeed ... That isn't necessary.... Satisfactory.... No, stay there, Archie is here ... How sure are you? ... Very satisfactory.... No, call again in an hour or so."
As he hung up there was a gleam in his eye. "Open it," he said. I inserted the key, fiddled with it a little, got it, lifted the lid all the way, stared a second for effect, and said, "It's empty," and when Perdis bounced up and came, my hand jerked up with the gun, not having been told that that part of the performance

Jules Khoury stood up, vetoed whatever he had in - tended, and sat down again. He spoke. "Use your head, Perdis. He didn't even know it was empty. Why would he - "

I obeyed. Perdis, still on his feet, was in the way, so I detoured around back of the chairs. He was yapping, and Khoury was up again. Of course I hadn't the dim - mest idea what was coming next as I shut the door and put my back to it, gun in hand, but apparently Wolfe had. Ignoring them, he had lifted the receiver and was dialing. Since he hadn't consulted the book and there were only three phone numbers he bothered to keep in his head, I knew who he must be getting, even before he spoke and asked for Mr. Cramer. In a moment he had him.

They were speechless. Anne Talbot lifted her head.
"I made the proposal," Wolfe said, "not out of caprice, to plague you, but for a purpose, and the purpose has been served. You have the gun, Archie? Go and stand at the door. No one is to leave."
I obeyed. Perdis, still on his feet, was in the way, so I detoured around back of the chairs. He was yapping, and Khoury was up again. Of course I hadn't the dim - mest idea what was coming next as I shut the door and put my back to it, gun in hand, but apparently Wolfe had. Ignoring them, he had lifted the receiver and was dialing. Since he hadn't consulted the book and there were only three phone numbers he bothered to keep in his head, I knew who he must be getting, even before he spoke and asked for Mr. Cramer. In a moment he had him.
"Mr. Cramer? The situation has developed as I expected. How soon can you be here with Mrs. Hazen? ... No. I will not. I told you more than half an hour ago that I would almost certainly call you.... No. I told you that her presence would be essential. If you come without her you won't be admitted.... Yes. I am prepared to suggest a substitute.... Yes.... Yes!"
==> Mrs. Oliver was on her feet too; they all were, except for Anne Talbot, and as Wolfe hung up Perdis said through his teeth, "Damn you, you gave it to the police!" <==
"No," Wolfe said. "Are you a dunce? Would I contrive such a hocus-pocus just to pass the time? Confound it, sit down! I have something to say that you would prefer to hear before Mr. Cramer arrives."

I'm leaving," Mrs. Oliver said. "This was all a trick and you'll regret it. I'm going."
"No one is going. Mr. Goodwin wouldn't shoot you, but he wouldn't have to. Sit down."
Khoury, with his chair right back of his knees, merely had to bend them. Perdis, going to his chair, jostled Mrs. Oliver and didn't apologize. She turned to face me at the door, decided that Wolfe was right, I wouldn't have to shoot, and sat.

"I don't believe it," Mrs. Oliver said. "It's a trick."

His eyes went to Wolfe. "But this Cramer - that's Inspector Cramer? You said he has to know about what you call our peculiar relations with Hazen. Why does he?"
The doorbell rang. I was on post and could have let Fritz take it, but they were all in their chairs, so I opened the door to the hall and stepped through. I expected to see Cramer alone, since there hadn't been time for him to get Lucy from the jug, but she was there with him on the stoop, and at her elbow was
Sergeant Purley Stebbins. He must have had her brought to 20th Street when Wolfe made his first phone call. And as I dropped the gun in my pocket and moved, the door to the front room opened and Theodore Weed darted out and to the front door. He couldn't possibly have heard through the soundproofed wall and door, so either he had been looking out a window or his feeling for her included some kind of a personal electronic receiver.
Seeing no reason to spoil his fun, I let him open the door. Cramer shot him a glance as he entered. Lucy crossed the threshold, saw him, and stopped. She stared, and he stared back. He lifted a hand and let it drop. Stebbins, back of her, growled, "On in, Mrs. Hazen." She looked at me, and back at Weed, and I said, "Everything's under control, Mrs. Hazen," and Weed backed up a step. I thought, and still think, that he had intended to warn her that Wolfe and I were a pair of Judases, but the mere sight of her paralyzed him. He stood and stared while Cramer and Stebbins got their coats off and I took hers and put it on a hanger. When we headed for the office he followed us, and there was no point in herding him back to the front room. Either Wolfe had the cards or he hadn't.

He stood and stared while Cramer and Stebbins got their coats off and I took hers and put it on a hanger. When we headed for the office he followed us, and there was no point in herding him back to the front room. Either Wolfe had the cards or he hadn't.
Three steps in, Cramer stopped to send his eyes around. I didn't envy him any. The four people there weren't a bunch of bums, anything but; they had position and connections and lawyers if necessary, and much wampum. And here he was, in the office of a private detective, with a woman charged with murder.
Of course he had a good reason: he suspected he might have stubbed his toe. I hadn't been present when Wolfe had made his previous phone call, but

 presumably he had said that he expected soon to be ready to offer a substitute for Mrs. Hazen, and Cramer knew Wolfe only too well.
==> But naturally he didn't care to give that reason to that audience. He faced them. "I'm here because Wolfe told me that you four people would be here and I wanted to know what he had to say to you. I brought <==
Mrs. Hazen because from something Wolfe said I got the idea that it would be in the interest of justice for her to be here. I want to make it plain that as an officer of the law I don't rely on any private detective to do my job for me, and what's more no private detective is going to interfere."
He went to the red leather chair and sat. Stebbins took Lucy to the extra chair, next to Perdis, and stood behind her. That way they had their murderer surrounded, with Cramer in front of her only three paces off. Weed went to a chair over by the big globe. As I circled around to get to my desk Wolfe spoke.
"Mr. Stebbins. Mrs. Hazen is your prisoner, and of course it's your duty to guard her. But I doubt if she intends any outbreak. If you wish to stand by the murderer of Mr. Hazen I suggest that you move to Mr. Khoury."
Silence. Not a sound. For the record, for how people react, four of them - Cramer, Lucy, Mrs. Oliver, and
Anne Talbot - kept their eyes at Wolfe. Perdis and Sergeant Stebbins moved theirs to Khoury. Weed, over by the globe, got up, took a step, and stopped. Khoury's head tilted back, slowly, until his eyes were forced on Wolfe past the tip of his long thin nose. "That's my name," he said. "I'm the only Khoury here."

"The objects are here?" Cramer demanded.
"No. I don't know where they are. I have never seen them. The people are here. This will go better if you keep your questions until I'm through. Three of them - Mrs. Oliver, Mrs. Talbot, and Mr. Perdis - came prepared to pay, and that was what I was after. I was acting on the premise, certainly worth a test, that one of Hazen's victims had killed him, and to kill him might have been futile unless he got the object or objects that had made it possible for Hazen to bleed him. For a moment I abandon fact for surmise. Mr. Khoury did get the object or objects. By some ruse, probably with the promise of a large sum of money as a lure, he induced Hazen to get his car from the garage Monday night and drive somewhere, and to have with him the object or objects. That surmise is not haphazard. The others came here this evening prepared to pay, but not Mr. Khoury. He knew I had nothing to support my threat. Even when I told him that the objects pertaining to him would be given to the police in ninety minutes he was unmoved."
"Get back to facts," Cramer growled. His head turned. "Mr. Khoury, do you want to comment?"
"No." From Khoury's smile you might have thought he was enjoying it. "This is fascinating. I thought I had decided not to bring my share of the million because I didn't believe he had anything that threatened anybody."
Wolfe, ignoring him, stayed at Cramer. "For a fact I submit the conversation at the gathering Monday evening after Mrs. Hazen and Mr. Weed had left. Of course you and your staff have it in detail, but you didn't know that Hazen was a

In that conversation he introduced topics that obviously referred to the pinch he had them in - for instance, poison. I don't know which of those present that touched, and am not concerned. But one of his topics pointed clearly at Mr. Khoury. He remarked that his wife's father had been a great inventor, a genius; and his wife's father, Titus Postel, had been associated with Mr. Khoury. So it seemed likely that his hold on Mr. Khoury was in some way connected with Titus Postel, but at the time I learned that, yesterday evening, I had no reason to single out Mr. Khoury for special attention, so I merely noted it for possible future application."
Wolfe took a breath. "But two incidents today did single out Mr. Khoury. Shortly after one o'clock you phoned me to say that the gun I had given you had been the property of Titus Postel and that he had committed suicide with it five years ago; and soon after that, on the telephone with Mr. Khoury, he informed me that he would be present this evening but that he was declining my proposal. He didn't put it in those terms, but that was the gist."
Khoury made a noise, a subdued snort. Cramer said, "Yes, Mr. Khoury?" "Nothing," Khoury said.

Lucy's lips formed a "No," but there was almost no sound where I sat, five steps away.

"How long after his death did it disappear?"
"I don't know. It was about two years after that I noticed it was gone." "Had you any idea who took it?"
"I didn't know, but I thought perhaps Mrs. Khoury had. I didn't ask her. She thought I shouldn't keep it because it only reminded me ..." She let it hang. "Is it true that my husband was a blackmailer?"
"Yes. And your former employer is not only a murderer, he tried to make you his scapegoat. You have been unfortunate in your choice of male associates, but I can relieve your mind about one you didn't choose, your father. He didn't commit suicide; he was murdered. By Mr. Khoury."
"No," Khoury said. "Another one? You're piling it on."

The evidence almost certainly exists, but to get it will require authority and a large trained staff, and I have neither. I am obliged to Mr. Hazen for a valuable hint, his remark that Mrs. Hazen's father was a great inventor and a genius. That suggested that you might have cheated him <==

 out of the proceeds of his genius, and immediately after talking with you on the phone today I put a man on it."
Wolfe fumed to Cramer. "The man was Saul Panzer. You know his capacities. He phoned me about an hour ago, just before I called you, and what he reported was the basis for my statement to Mrs. Hazen, that Khoury killed her father. I don't tell you what he reported because you will get it from him, and also because I don't want Mr. Khoury to know what has been uncovered, and neither do you. As I said, I am only offering a suggestion, but I trust it is cogent enough to persuade you to restrict Mr. Khoury's movements, and to put some men to work. He may have taken Hazen's keys on the chance that they might be useful, and he may still have them, though not on his person. Find them. Ransack his premises. He may even still have the object or objects he certainly took; find them. If you see his wife before he is allowed to communicate with her you may learn something about Gun P." He flipped a hand. "But this is superfluous; you know your job. If I have - "
Khoury had moved. No rush, he wasn't a bit disturbed, but he was on his feet. "Really," he said, "there's a limit." His straight line to the door was in front of Mrs. Oliver and Perdis and Lucy, but it would have been bad manners to cross their bows, so he started around. On past Mrs. Oliver, and Perdis, and Lucy, with Stebbins at her shoulder, before Cramer spoke. "Stop him, Purley." Khoury whirled, saying through his teeth, "Don't touch me."
"Nuts," Purley said, and began going over him for a gun. Gun X, maybe. Anyway, Khoury couldn't have made it to the hall because Theodore Weed was there filling the door.

"Nuts," Purley said, and began going over him for a gun. Gun X, maybe. Anyway, Khoury couldn't have made it to the hall because Theodore Weed was there filling the door.

Chapter 10
I'll have to leave it with two loose ends.
First, the object or objects pertaining to AnneTalbot, Mrs. Oliver, Perdis, and presumably other assorted Hazen clients. They have never turned up. At least, the cops never found them. If one of the clients did, he didn't announce it. So if the hints Hazen scattered around at the dinner party aroused your curiosity, I can't satisfy it.
==> Second, the fee that Wolfe had certainly earned. Lucy refused to take any of Hazen's leavings; she wouldn't even take the house. That was noble, and even decent, considering how he had got it, but private detectives have to eat. Unquestionably Nero Wolfe has to eat. There's a chance that she'll get a chunk of Khoury's pile eventually, on account of the evidence Cramer dug up that Khoury had stolen a couple of Titus Postel's inventions, but Khoury, who is now in the death house while his lawyers hop around from court to court, has admitted nothing, and neither has his wife. So if you're curious as to how much Wolfe collected for his thirty-six hours' work I can't satisfy you on that either. <==
As for a third point you might be curious about, whether Lucy and Theodore Weed have found out how they feel about each other, you may have one guess. If you need more than one, what do you suppose makes the world go around?

Chapter 1
==> The red leather chair was four feet away from the end of Nero Wolfe's desk, so when she got the gun from her handbag she had to get up and take a step to put it on the desk. Then she returned to the chair, closed the bag, and told Wolfe, "That's the gun I'm not going to shoot my husband with." <==
Sitting facing her with my back to my desk, which was at right angles to Wolfe's, I raised my brows. I hadn't expected her to put on an act. When she had phoned the previous afternoon to ask for an appointment she had of course sounded a little jumpy, as most people do when they call the office of a private detective, but she had been quite matter-of-fact in giving the details. Her name
was Lucy Hazen, Mrs. Barry Hazen. She gave her address, on East 37th Street between Park and Lexington. All she wanted was thirty minutes with Nero Wolfe, to tell him something confidential. She didn't want him to do anything, not even give her advice; she merely wanted to tell him something; and she would pay one hundred dollars for the half-hour. She could and would pay more if she had to, but she hoped the hundred would be enough.
In November or December, when Wolfe's income has reached a point where out of a hundred received he can keep only twenty bucks, he will make an appointment only for someone or something very special, but this was January, no big fee was in prospect, and even a measly C would help in the upkeep of his
old brownstone on West 35th Street, including staff, particularly since he wouldn't have to work for it. So it was set for 11:30 the following morning, Tuesday.
When the doorbell rang at 11:30 on the dot and I went to let her in, she gave me a smile and said, "Thank you for getting him to see me." Handshakes can be faked and usually are, but smiles can't. It isn't often that a man gets a natural, friendly, straightforward smile from a young woman who has never seen him before, with no come-on, no catch, and no dare, and the least he can do is return it if he has that kind in stock. As I took her to the office and helped her off with her coat, which was mink, I was thinking that you never know, even the good- looking wife of a well-known public relations operator like Barry Hazen could have her feelings on straight. I was pleased to meet her.

"It will be a pleasure," I said, and meant it, but Wolfe was pushing back his chair. "Mr. Goodwin doesn't owe you the ten minutes. I do," he said, lifting his bulk.
"Come with me. You won't need your coat." He headed for the door. She gave me a glance with a suggestion of a smile, and followed him out. The sound came from the hall of the elevator door opening and closing.
I had no kick coming. The ten thousand orchids in the three plant rooms up on the roof of the old brownstone were his, not mine. He did like to show them off - so would you if they were yours - but that wasn't why he had intervened. He had some letters to dictate, and he thought that if I took her up to look at the orchids there was no telling when we would come back down.

Years ago he decided, on insufficient evidence, that I forget about time when I am with an attractive young woman, and once he has decided something that settles it.
==> The phone rang. I got it at my desk and told it, "Nero Wolfe's office, Archie Goodwin speaking." It was a man over in Jersey who makes sausage to Wolfe's specifications, wanting to know if we were ready for a shipment, and I switched it to Fritz in the kitchen. Thinking there was no better way for a licensed detective to fill idle time than by snooping, I picked up the mink coat for an inspection. When I saw that the label said Bergmann I decided that inspection would be superfluous and put it back on the chair. I picked up the gun that she wasn't going to shoot her husband with. It was a Drexel .32, nice and clean, and the cylinder was full of cartridges, nothing for a lady with no permit to be toting around town. I inspected her check, East Side Bank and Trust Company, signed Lucy Hazen, and went and put it in the safe. After glancing at my watch, I turned on the radio for the noon news, and stood and stretched while <==
I listened to it. Algeria was boiling. A building contractor on Staten Island denied that he had had favors from a politician. Fidel Castro was telling the Cuban people that the people who ran the United States government were a bunch of bums (my translation). Then:
"The body of a man named Barry Hazen was found this morning in an alley between two buildings on Norton Street in the lower West Side of Manhattan. He had been shot in the back and had been dead for some hours. No further details are available at present. Mr. Hazen was a well-known public-relations counselor. The Democratic leaders in Congress have apparently decided to center their fire - "
I turned it off.

"I do not intend," he stated, "to serve the convenience of a murderer. What about her face? I was at one side."
"One will get you fifty," I said. "You heard her stutter that I was m - m - making it up. Then when I said no, he had been shot dead and it hit her as a fact, she went white, all white, in three seconds. Maybe she can wiggle her ears, but she can't do that. No one can."
"Very well. Call Mr. Cohen and get details."
"Anything in particular?"
"Whatever he has, but I want to know if the weapon has been found, or a bullet."
==> "He would appreciate a major scoop, such as that the widow of the deceased visited the office of Nero Wolfe this morning. Why not, since she's going to report it?" <==
"Very well."
I got at the phone and dialed the number of the Gazette, and soon had Lon Cohen. When I tossed him the bone about Mrs. Hazen coming to see Wolfe, naturally he wanted the whole skeleton, not to mention meat, but I told him that would be all for now and how about some reciprocity? He obliged, and gave me the crop, and I thanked him and hung up and turned to Wolfe.
"The body was found by a truck driver at ten-eighteen a.m. It was stiff, so he must have been dead at least five hours and probably more. He was fully

 dressed, including an overcoat, and his hat was there on the ground. The usual items in his pockets, including a couple of dollars in change, except that there were no keys, and no wallet and no watch. Of course they could have been taken by someone who found him earlier and forgot to mention it. His name was on letters in his pocket, so the wallet wasn't taken to delay identification. Shot once, in the back, and a rib stopped the bullet and they have it. A thirty-two. Weapon not found. If the police have any leads or notions they're saving them, but of course it was found less than three hours ago." I glanced at my wrist. "Two hours and forty-nine minutes. Lon says he would have paid me five grand if I had kept Mrs. Hazen here until he could send a man to take her picture and ask her who shot her husband, and I told him I'll bear that in mind next time."

If you think I was keyed up more than the circumstances warranted, look it over. If the bullets matched I was a sap. It was a million to one that the murderer hadn't sneaked into the house to put the gun back in the drawer in Hazen's room; why would he? Murderers often do crazy things, but not that crazy. Therefore Mrs. Hazen had lied, and she had either killed him or knew who did, and I was a beetlehead. I had to do three of the letters twice.
By six o'clock, when Wolfe came down from the plant rooms, I had begun to relax. He went to his desk and started on the letters I had put there, which he always reads with care. After he had finished a couple and signed them I remarked, "Of course Cramer wouldn't bother to phone if the bullets didn't match."
He grunted.
"And the laboratory got it more than two hours ago, so we might as well - " The doorbell rang, and the bottom of my spine curled.
Cramer had waited until six o'clock, when he knew Wolfe would be available. I went to the hall and switched the stoop light on, and my spine went back to normal. It was a stranger, a man about my age, maybe a little younger, with no hat and a mop of brown hair shuffled by the wind. I had never been so delighted to see a stranger, but had it under control by the time I got to the door and opened it and said, "Yes, sir?"
==> "I want to see Nero Wolfe. My name's Weed, Theodore Weed." <==
I should have had him wait there while I went and told Wolfe, that was the routine, but I was so glad to see him that I invited him in and helped him off with his coat. Then I went to the office and announced, "Theodore Weed to see you. One of the dinner guests. The one who - "
"What does he want?"


He knew damn well I hadn't had time to ask what he wanted. I said, "You."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 69475    window = 69470 69480


"Damn it, I know she did! She told me so! She was here when she heard about it, that they had found his body! And she wanted to hire you, she wanted to give you a check, and you wouldn't take it!" He paused to control his jaw. "So I want to hire you, and I'll pay your bill. I just left the District Attorney's office and she's still there. They wouldn't let me see her, but she's there and they're going to charge her with murder. I can't see why it's presumption for me to want to hire you - you're in the detective business and my money is as good as anybody's. All right, I got ahead of myself asking you about the gun, but when I'm your client there's no reason why you shouldn't tell me where it is."
He stuck a hand in his pocket and brought out a wad of bills, not a thick one, and unfolded it.
I was trying to decide. Either he thought that Lucy Hazen had killed her husband, and was being chivalrous, or he didn't think she had but was selling Wolfe the idea that he did think so. Whichever it was, he was willing to spend money on it, for he got up from his chair to put the bills on Wolfe's desk.

As Wolfe started to speak the phone rang, and I turned and got it. It was Lucy Hazen. She asked for Wolfe, and I told her to hold it and turned to him. "The woman that brought the sausage this morning wants to know if it will do. If you want to ask Fritz you can talk on the kitchen extension."
==> He got up and went, and I held on. In a moment his voice was in my ear. "This is Nero Wolfe. Mrs. Hazen?" <==
"Yes. You said this morning that if I need your services you would see." Her voice was shaky. "I do need them. I'm going to be arrested, and I - "
"Where are you?"
"At the District Attorney's. I don't know any - "
"Say only what you must say on the telephone."
"I'm in a booth with the door closed."

"Hold it. I'm giving you a break. Shall I come and slap you with the gun? Turn around."
He turned. A leather case from the bag was stuffed with credentials - driver's license, credit cards, others.
Some of them said Anne Talbot and others Mrs. Henry Lewis Talbot. That was the young woman, whose attractions, both from the front and the rear, were so obvious that they had caught my eye even though my eyes were busy. There was a leather keyfold and I snapped it open to inspect the keys, and compared one of them with the key to the house which I had in my pocket. It didn't match. I returned the items to the bag one by one and picked up the other bag and dumped it.
The woman with silvery hair was Mrs. Victor Oliver.
There was no key in her bag like the one I had, and nothing of interest. I examined the pockets of the coats, all four of them, and found no key.
==> As I stepped around the end of the bed I allowed myself a grin at a detail I had observed; they all had gloves on - not rubber ones secured for the occasion, just gloves. "Now that I know your names," I said, "it's only fair that you should know mine. Archie Goodwin. I work for a man you may have heard of, Nero Wolfe, the private detective. He has been hired by Mrs. Barry Hazen, and I have her key to the house and her written authority to enter. I need to know which one of you has a key and I'm going to find out. You may turn around, but stay where you are. You will take off your clothes and pile them on the floor, including your shoes and socks or stockings, but I think not your underwear. I'll see." <==
They were facing me at four paces. Anne Talbot said,
"I won't. It's outrageous." She was extremely easy to look at.
"Pooh," I said. "Pretend you're at the beach or a pool. Do you want me to peel you? Don't think I wouldn't."
"We have no key," Mrs. Oliver said. She was easy to look away from, with her flabby jowl and little yellow eyes set deep. "The maid let us in. She has gone out, but when she comes back you can ask her."

"No. I had them strip and went through their clothes. They say the maid let them in. She's not here; of course they greased her. Perdis just offered me fifty grand to go away and forget I was here. I'll split it with you. He would probably double it."
"Pfui. Are you intact?"
"Sure. I'm calling just to tell you to expect us, say in half an hour, maybe less."
Silence. He would have to work, not tomorrow, but now - and two women. Then: "I suppose I must," and he hung up.
Perdis had joined the others at the wall. As I cradled the phone he spoke. "We will double it. One hundred thousand dollars."
==> "Skip it." I moved to the foot of the bed. "What would I tell my wife if I had one? You heard me tell Nero Wolfe to expect us in half an hour, but you have a choice. You can leave and go your ways and try to forget you were here, and I'll phone Inspector Cramer and report this incident, omitting nothing. Or you can come and talk it over with Nero Wolfe, and he may or may not care to bother Cramer about it. You may have two minutes to consider it." I looked at my wrist. <==
"Listen, Mr. Goodwin," Anne Talbot said. She had her clothes on, and with or without them she was highly ornamental. "We were looking for something that belongs to us. We're not thieves. We're respectable - "
I cut her off. "Sorry, but don't waste it on me. I just run errands. It's either Nero Wolfe or the police. If you pick Nero Wolfe there will be a slight delay because I have a little chore to do in this room. You will take your things and go downstairs and on out, and get two taxis. You will get into one of the taxis and wait there in front of the house, and have the other one there for me. I'll be down soon, probably in a couple of minutes. There's one complication: if you split and one or two of you prefer to go somewhere else, I'll phone the police immediately. I would rather not, but I'd have to."
Two of them, Perdis and Mrs. Oliver, started to speak, but I shut them off and moved away from the bed. Anne Talbot went to the bed and got her coat, and Khoury went and held it for her, and then got his own. Anne Talbot said to Perdis and Mrs. Oliver, "Is there any alternative?" Perdis went and got Mrs.

 Oliver's coat and took it to her, and she went to the bed for her bag.

Perdis went and got Mrs.

 Oliver's coat and took it to her, and she went to the bed for her bag.
Perdis was the last one out. When he had started down the stairs I shut the door, put a chair against it, went to the chest of drawers, a big heavy piece at the left wall, and took out the bottom drawer. There was a folded blanket in it. I squatted at the opening. The board that the drawer slid on, solid, not a plywood panel, was flush and snugly fitted, no play to it. I tried to get its edge with my thumbnails; nothing doing. I got out my pocketknife, stuck the point of the blade in the crack at the center, just barely in, pried gently, and up it came. The front edge of the board was beveled. Very neat. I put my hand in, felt metal, got a finger under, and here came the box. It was steel, anything but flimsy, twelve inches by six and about two inches deep, and weighed a good four pounds, with a lock not to be opened with a nail file. I shook it and heard no movement, which didn't prove anything. With the board down, I replaced the drawer, moved the chair away from the door and opened it, and went to the head of the stairs. No sound of voices from below. If I had gone down and joined them in the hall carrying a steel box which I must have found in Hazen's room they would have made quite a party of it. I descended a flight, stood to listen half a minute, and went on down. They had turned on the light in the lower hall. My hat and coat were there on the floor. I put the Marley in the holster, put on the hat and coat, slipped the box under the coat, with my hand in my pocket holding it, turned out the light, and opened the door.
They had followed instructions to a T. Two taxis were there, and they were in the one in the rear, all four of them. After glancing in I told the driver to follow my taxi, went and got in and gave the driver the address, and we rolled.

 stuttering in two minutes and twenty seconds, and I have a bet with Saul Panzer that I can do it in two minutes flat with three more tries.
Cramer and Stebbins finally decided they had had enough of me. It was 9:32 by my watch, and 9:34 by the clock on the wall, which was wrong, as I crossed the reception room of the precinct house to the door, and on out. I stood on the sidewalk for three good breaths of the cold fresh air, giving my lungs a treat and deciding which way to turn. If right, toward Eighth Avenue, it would be for a taxi; if left, toward Ninth, it would be for a fifteen-minute walk. Voting for the walk, I moved, and had taken three steps when my shoulder was grabbed and yanked from behind and a voice came, with feeling: "You dirty rat!"
The yank had turned me some and I turned myself the rest of the way. It was Theodore Weed. His hands were fists, and the right one was back a foot, with the elbow bent. His eyes were blazing and his bony jaw was set.
"Not here, you damn fool," I said. "Even if you drop me with one swing, which is doubtful, I'll yell police as I go down and here they'll come. Besides, I have a right to know why I'm a rat while I'm still conscious. Why?"
==> "You know why. You're a filthy stool, and Nero Wolfe too. You're working for Lucy? You are like hell. You gave the police the gun." <==
"How do you know we did?"
"Things they asked me. Do you deny it?"
My brain was a little tired after the long day, but it was doing its best. This character was by no means crossed off. We only had his word for it that he would give both arms to help Lucy; he had said himself that she didn't know how he felt about her. A chat with him wouldn't hurt and might help, but I couldn't take him home with me until I knew what Wolfe had on his program, if anything.
He still had fists. "I'll tell you what," I said. "We'll go around the corner to Jake's and I'll buy you a drink and we'll discuss it. Then if you still want to take a poke at me Jake will let us use the back room provided we let him watch. Afterwards you can comb your hair if you're up to it. It needs it."
It didn't appeal to him, but what would have? A couple of passersby, noticing his

"Nuts," Purley said, and began going over him for a gun. Gun X, maybe. Anyway, Khoury couldn't have made it to the hall because Theodore Weed was there filling the door.

Chapter 10
I'll have to leave it with two loose ends.
First, the object or objects pertaining to AnneTalbot, Mrs. Oliver, Perdis, and presumably other assorted Hazen clients. They have never turned up. At least, the cops never found them. If one of the clients did, he didn't announce it. So if the hints Hazen scattered around at the dinner party aroused your curiosity, I can't satisfy it.
==> Second, the fee that Wolfe had certainly earned. Lucy refused to take any of Hazen's leavings; she wouldn't even take the house.

There's a chance that she'll get a chunk of Khoury's pile eventually, on account of the evidence Cramer dug up that Khoury had stolen a couple of Titus Postel's inventions, but Khoury, who is now in the death house while his lawyers hop around from court to court, has admitted nothing, and neither has his wife. So if you're curious as to how much Wolfe collected for his thirty-six hours' work I can't satisfy you on that either. <==
As for a third point you might be curious about, whether Lucy and Theodore Weed have found out how they feel about each other, you may have one guess. If you need more than one, what do you suppose makes the world go around?

"It will be a pleasure," I said, and meant it, but Wolfe was pushing back his chair. "Mr. Goodwin doesn't owe you the ten minutes. I do," he said, lifting his bulk.
"Come with me. You won't need your coat." He headed for the door. She gave me a glance with a suggestion of a smile, and followed him out. The sound came from the hall of the elevator door opening and closing.
I had no kick coming. The ten thousand orchids in the three plant rooms up on the roof of the old brownstone were his, not mine. He did like to show them off - so would you if they were yours - but that wasn't why he had intervened. He had some letters to dictate, and he thought that if I took her up to look at the orchids there was no telling when we would come back down.

Years ago he decided, on insufficient evidence, that I forget about time when I am with an attractive young woman, and once he has decided something that settles it.
==> The phone rang. I got it at my desk and told it, "Nero Wolfe's office, Archie Goodwin speaking." It was a man over in Jersey who makes sausage to Wolfe's specifications, wanting to know if we were ready for a shipment, and I switched it to Fritz in the kitchen. Thinking there was no better way for a licensed detective to fill idle time than by snooping, I picked up the mink coat for an inspection. When I saw that the label said Bergmann I decided that inspection would be superfluous and put it back on the chair. I picked up the gun that she wasn't going to shoot her husband with. It was a Drexel .32, nice and clean, and the cylinder was full of cartridges, nothing for a lady with no permit to be toting around town. I inspected her check, East Side Bank and Trust Company, signed Lucy Hazen, and went and put it in the safe. After glancing at my watch, I turned on the radio for the noon news, and stood and stretched while <==
I listened to it. Algeria was boiling. A building contractor on Staten Island denied that he had had favors from a politician. Fidel Castro was telling the Cuban people that the people who ran the United States government were a bunch of bums (my translation). Then:
"The body of a man named Barry Hazen was found this morning in an alley between two buildings on Norton Street in the lower West Side of Manhattan. He had been shot in the back and had been dead for some hours. No further details are available at present. Mr. Hazen was a well-known public-relations counselor. The Democratic leaders in Congress have apparently decided to center their fire - "
I turned it off.

She rammed her fists against her temples and pounded them. Wolfe said, "I'll be in the kitchen," and turned to go. To him a woman overwhelmed, no matter by what, is merely a woman having a fit, and it's too much for him. But I said, "Hold it, she'll be all right in a minute," and he came and looked down at her, let out a growl, went to his chair, and sat.
"I want to phone somebody," she said. "I have to know. Who can I phone?" Her fists were in her lap.
"A shot of brandy or whisky wouldn't hurt," I told her. "I don't want anything. Who can I phone?"
"Nobody." Wolfe was curt. "Not just now."
Her head jerked to him. "Why not?"
==> "Because he must first consider whether I should phone - phone the police to report what you have told me. I promised to. Archie. Where's the gun?" <==
"In my desk drawer."
"Has it been fired recently?"
"No telling. If so it's been cleaned. It's fully loaded and the cartridges all look alike."
"Did she shoot him?"
That was routine; he merely wanted my opinion as a qualified expert on women.

"Why ..." She was on the edge of the chair. "Will they ask me that?"
"Certainly. Unless they already have the murderer and the evidence beyond all question, and that's too much to hope for. You will have to account for every minute since you last saw your husband. Did you come here in a cab?"
"Yes."
"Then you'll say so. You'll have to. And when they ask why you came to see me what will you say?"
She shook her head. She looked at me and back at him. "Oh," she said. "You'll have to tell me what to say."
==> He nodded. "I expected that." His head turned. "Archie. What grounds have you for your guess?" <==


I was back in my chair. "Partly personal," I told him, "and partly professional. Personal, my general impression of her, and specifically her smile when I let her in. Professional, two points. First, if she shot him last night after making an appointment with you and then came here with that jabber, she is either completely loony or the trickiest specimen I have ever laid eyes on, and I'll buy neither one. Second, and this is really it, her face when she realized he was dead. She might fake a faint or the staggers or even some fancy hysterics, but no woman alive could make her blood go like that. I said I would need facts to make it final, but I should have said I would need facts, and good ones, to make me guess again."
Wolfe grunted and turned to her with a scowl.
"Granting that Mr. Goodwin's grounds are valid, what then? When the police learn that the widow of a man murdered last night came to see me this morning they will harass me beyond tolerance. I owe you nothing. You are not my client. You have paid me a hundred dollars for half an hour of my time, now stretched to more than an hour, and released me from my promise, so that incident is closed. You asked me to tell you what to say when they ask you what you came here for, but they will also ask me. What if you fail to follow my advice and my account differs from yours? Why should I take that risk? I can see no alternative - What are you doing now?"

When did she leave?" "Shortly before one o'clock."
Cramer took his overcoat off, ignored my offer to take it, put it on the arm of the red leather chair, and sat. "An hour and a half," he said, not barking but a little hoarse. He is always a little hoarse when he is dealing with Wolfe. "What did she have to say?" He hadn't touched the hat.
Wolfe swiveled and leaned back. "Mr. Cramer. I know that Mrs. Hazen's husband has been shot and killed. She was with me when the news came on my radio. I know that when I have been consulted by a person who is in any way connected with a death by violence you automatically assume that I have knowledge of evidence that would be useful in your investigation. Sometimes your assumption is valid; sometimes it isn't. This time it isn't; that is my considered opinion. Mrs. Hazen consulted me in confidence. If at any time I have reason to think that by refusing to disclose what she told me I am obstructing justice, I'll communicate with you at once."
Cramer got a cigar from a pocket, rolled it between his palms, stuck it in his mouth, and clamped his teeth on it. He does that instead of counting ten, when he knows that the words that are on his tongue would make things worse instead of better. He took the cigar from his mouth. "Some day," he said, "you're going to fall off and get hurt, and this could be it. If and when you find it gets too hot to hang onto it any longer, and you turn loose, arid you have obstructed justice by not telling me now, I'll get your hide. Nothing and no one will stop me. I'm asking you to tell me what Mrs. Barry Hazen said when she came to see you nine hours after her husband was murdered."
==> Wolfe shook his head. "I decline to tell you because I believe, as matters stand now, that it is not pertinent to your inquiry. Should I have occasion to change my mind - and by the way, I can offer you an opportunity to change it for me. Archie, where's that bullet?" <==
I got the envelope from my drawer, took the bullet out, and handed it to him. Cramer's sharp gray eyes were on me and followed the bullet back to Wolfe.
Wolfe took it in his fingers, barely glanced at it, handed it back to me, and said, "Give it to Mr. Cramer." As I did so he turned to Cramer. "This will be pointless if you have found the weapon that was used to shoot Mr. Hazen. Have you?"

No."
"It will also be pointless if you have not found the bullet that killed him. Have you?"

He knew damn well I hadn't had time to ask what he wanted. I said, "You."
"No. I've been pestered enough on a matter in which I have no interest. Tell him so and don't - "
Weed was there. He crossed to the red leather chair, plumped into it as if he owned it, and said, "I'm not going to pester you. I'm going to hire you."
Wolfe glared at me. I had let a man in without consulting him; he would have something to say about that when we were alone. Weed was going on. "I know you come high, but I pay my bills. Do you want a retainer?"
==> Wolfe had transferred the glare to him. "No. You not only intrude, you presume. Archie, show him the door." <==
"Now wait a minute. I'm not very ..." He let it hang and started to work his jaw. He had plenty of jaw, a little bony but not out of proportion. He got it under control. "All right, I started wrong. I'll try again. Mrs. Barry Hazen came to see you this morning and left a gun with you. Where is it?"
"Intrusion and presumption," Wolfe said, "and now effrontery. I must insist - "
"Damn it, I know she did! She told me so! She was here when she heard about it, that they had found his body! And she wanted to hire you, she wanted to give you a check, and you wouldn't take it!" He paused to control his jaw. "So I want to hire you, and I'll pay your bill. I just left the District Attorney's office and she's still there. They wouldn't let me see her, but she's there and they're going to charge her with murder. I can't see why it's presumption for me to want to hire you - you're in the detective business and my money is as good as anybody's. All right, I got ahead of myself asking you about the gun, but when I'm your client there's no reason why you shouldn't tell me where it is."
He stuck a hand in his pocket and brought out a wad of bills, not a thick one, and unfolded it.
I was trying to decide. Either he thought that Lucy Hazen had killed her husband, and was being chivalrous, or he didn't think she had but was selling Wolfe the idea that he did think so. Whichever it was, he was willing to spend money on it, for he got up from his chair to put the bills on Wolfe's desk.

"No."
"Satisfactory. One instruction: if you have an intention to reject property left you by your husband you will neither declare it nor indicate it. You're going to have

 some bills to pay."
"But I don't want anything from him! I told you - "
==> "We're on the phone. The lawyer will join me in that instruction. His name is Nathaniel Parker. Archie, get Mr. Parker. I'll talk from here." <==

Chapter 4
I pushed the button down, released it, dialed Parker's home number, got him, buzzed the kitchen, and Wolfe got on. He gave Parker the necessary facts, and not much more - nothing of what Mrs. Hazen had told us that morning, nothing about the gun. He did say that I had formed the conclusion that she had not shot her husband, and that he had accepted it. Parker was to arrange for bail if she was bailable, if they held her on the big charge he was to get what he could at the DA's office. I waited to hang up until Wolfe was at the office door. He went to his desk, sat, leveled his eyes at Theodore Weed, and spoke.
"Now sir. That was timely. It was Mrs. Hazen on the phone. I have sent - "
"Where is she?"

"Hold it. I'm giving you a break. Shall I come and slap you with the gun? Turn around."
He turned. A leather case from the bag was stuffed with credentials - driver's license, credit cards, others.
Some of them said Anne Talbot and others Mrs. Henry Lewis Talbot. That was the young woman, whose attractions, both from the front and the rear, were so obvious that they had caught my eye even though my eyes were busy. There was a leather keyfold and I snapped it open to inspect the keys, and compared one of them with the key to the house which I had in my pocket. It didn't match. I returned the items to the bag one by one and picked up the other bag and dumped it.
The woman with silvery hair was Mrs. Victor Oliver.
There was no key in her bag like the one I had, and nothing of interest. I examined the pockets of the coats, all four of them, and found no key.
==> As I stepped around the end of the bed I allowed myself a grin at a detail I had observed; they all had gloves on - not rubber ones secured for the occasion, just gloves. "Now that I know your names," I said, "it's only fair that you should know mine. Archie Goodwin. I work for a man you may have heard of, Nero Wolfe, the private detective. He has been hired by Mrs. Barry Hazen, and I have her key to the house and her written authority to enter. I need to know which one of you has a key and I'm going to find out. You may turn around, but stay where you are. You will take off your clothes and pile them on the floor, including your shoes and socks or stockings, but I think not your underwear. I'll see." <==
They were facing me at four paces. Anne Talbot said,
"I won't. It's outrageous." She was extremely easy to look at.
"Pooh," I said. "Pretend you're at the beach or a pool. Do you want me to peel you? Don't think I wouldn't."
"We have no key," Mrs. Oliver said. She was easy to look away from, with her flabby jowl and little yellow eyes set deep. "The maid let us in. She has gone out, but when she comes back you can ask her."

"No." I cradled the receiver. "Say it fast and short."
He was handicapped for man-to-man talk, with his shirt on but his pants in his

 hands. "You are not a policeman," he said.
"No. I told you who I am."
==> "He's Archie Goodwin," Anne Talbot said. "I've seen him at the Flamingo." "You are a private detective," Perdis said. <==
"Right."
"Then you do things for money. We will pay you fifty thousand dollars if you will leave this house and forget that you have been here. Half of it in cash tomorrow morning and the other half later. We will give you a satisfactory guarantee, perhaps something in writing."
"How much later?"
"That's hard to say. It is delicate. We would need to be sure of your forgetting until certain difficulties have ended."
"That's pretty vague. Get your clothes on and we'll see." I picked up the phone and dialed, and he started toward me. I showed the gun, but he kept coming, saying something, and I dropped the phone and moved to meet him, and damned if he didn't swerve around me and dart for the phone. I had intended to tap him with the gun, not caring for bruised knuckles, but his swerve got him on the wrong side, so I took him from behind, with my left arm hooked under his chin and my hip at his rump, and levered him up and over. He landed on his hands and knees nine feet away. I said, "Cut out the horseplay and put your pants on," and went to the phone and dialed. After nine buzzes Wolfe's voice came.

 was a gun in the dashboard compartment, and it fired the bullet that killed him. We have traced it. It was bought by Hazen six years ago and he had a permit for it. He kept it in a drawer in his bedroom, and the maid saw it there yesterday morning when she went up to see why he hadn't come down for breakfast. Don't ask me why Mrs. Hazen took it from there afterwards and went to where she had parked the car on Twenty-first Street and put it in the car. I don't know, but maybe you do. So let's hear you."

Chapter 7
I squeezed my eyes shut because if I had kept them open they would have popped, and I didn't want to give Cramer that satisfaction. But I am supposed to help Wolfe when he needs it, and right then he sure could use a few seconds to arrange his mind, so I opened my eyes and asked Cramer, just curious, "What kind of a gun?"
He ignored it. He was having too good a time looking at Wolfe to bother with me. Wolfe was paying me another compliment. I was responsible for our assumption that Mrs. Hazen was innocent, but he didn't glance at me. He lowered his chin, scratched the tip of his nose, regarded Cramer for ten seconds, and then turned to me.
==> "Archie. It may be desirable to have a record of what Mr. Cramer just said. Type it. Verbatim. Double-spaced, one carbon." <==
As I got at the typewriter Cramer said, "I don't object. Naturally you've got to stall while you try to figure a way to climb down without breaking your neck."
No comment from Wolfe. I put in paper and hit the keys. Since I had had years of practice reporting long and involved conversations that had had time to fade, that one was no trick at all. As I rolled the paper out Wolfe said, "Initial the original," and I did so, and handed it to him. He read it through, in no hurry, took his pen and initialed it, handed it back to me, and turned to Cramer.
"I'm not stalling," he said. "If what you just told me is true, your demand for information is warranted. If it isn't true you're gulling me into disclosing a confidential communication from a client, and I want a record - "
"Then she's your client?"
"She is now. She wasn't when you were here yesterday, but she hired me later through Mr. Parker. I want a record of your words, and I have it. I also want more facts, to make sure that those you have given me are not qualified by others. That's a reasonable precaution, I think. What time did Mr. Hazen take his car from the garage Monday evening?"

Wolfe shook his head. "No. It's evidence in my investigation, but not in yours. You have your gun, the one the murderer used. How can it embarrass you to tell me about this one?"
Cramer considered it. "You're going to tell me what she said about it." "I am."
"Okay. Go ahead."
"I have your word?"
"Yes."
==> "Get the gun, Archie." <==
I went to the safe and squatted to twirl the knob. Ordinarily I leave it unlocked when I'm in the office, but with that box in it I was taking no chances, so after I had worked the combination and got the gun I shut the door and turned the knob. As I crossed to Cramer I spoke.
"By the way, I asked a question that wasn't answered. What make is your gun? The one that killed him."
"Drexel thirty-two."
"So's this." I handed it to him. "Of course there are millions of Drexel thirty- twos."
He gave it a look, and darned if he didn't sniff it. As I said, that's automatic. Also he flipped the cylinder open for a glance.

"Nuts." Cramer stood up. "Maybe an hour, maybe a week. I'm taking Goodwin. They'll take his statement at the District Attorney's office, a complete report of the conversation. I'll have a man here at two o'clock to take yours. If I took you down you'd only - "
"I shall sign no statement. I am not obliged to. If you send a man he won't be admitted. If you have questions, ask them."
Cramer's round red face got redder. But that was as far as it went; his memory of what had happened on the three occasions he had taken Wolfe downtown was

 presumably what stopped him. He stuck the gun in his pocket and turned to me. "Come on, Goodwin. We'll see."
==> As I arose the phone rang and I reached to get it. It was Nathaniel Parker. He was upset. "Archie? Nat Parker. Mrs. Hazen is being held on a charge of homicide, of course without bail. I want to see Wolfe before I see her. I have to know what she told him yesterday. I'll be there in twenty minutes." <==
"Fine," I said. "He's in a perfect mood for it. Come ahead." I hung up, told Wolfe, "Parker will be here in twenty minutes," and went to the hall for my coat and hat, with Cramer at my heels.

hapter 8
During the next nine hours I had various opportunities to try to sort it out. En route in a police car to the DA's office, later from there to Homicide West on 20th Street, and several waiting periods while assorted officers of the law, including the DA himself at one point, decided what to do next.
It was complicated enough even before an assistant DA kindly permitted me to use a phone, around three o'clock, and I called Wolfe. Of course the game was button, button, who had the gun when and where?

"Soak your head some more. We're working for her, not you."
No comment until the cab was turning into 35th Street, then: "I don't think she killed him."
"Good for you. We appreciate it."
"And I didn't."
"That's not so important, but we'll keep it in mind."
==> At the curb in front of the old brownstone there was a black limousine with a chauffeur in it. That would be Mrs. Oliver's. Mounting the seven steps to the stoop, I used my key, but the chain bolt was on and I had to ring for Fritz. As he took Weed's coat and I disposed of mine, he said, "Thank God, Archie, thank God," and I asked him what for, and he said, "For you. It has been very bad. Three phone calls during dinner, and that woman was in the front room." <==
"I can imagine. How many are in there now?" "Three. Her and two men."
So Khoury had come. I took Weed to the office. Wolfe was at his desk with a book. Weed headed for him, talking. "I want to know why - "
"Shut up!" Wolfe bellowed.
Wolfe's bellow would stop a tiger ready to spring.
Weed stood and glared at him. Wolfe finished a paragraph, inserted his marker,

"Indeed. Then why are you here?"
"I want to know what's in the box. If there's anything worth a quarter of a million to me, I'll buy it."
"The deadline is midnight." Wolfe glanced at the clock. "You would have ninety minutes."
"I don't think so. I don't think Mrs. Hazen knows about this. I think you're putting the screws on us without her knowledge. Whatever you're doing, I want to know what's in the box."
==> "Well." Wolfe's eyes left him to take in the others. "This situation was not covered by the terms of my proposal. Two of you are prepared to comply with the terms and should not suffer for Mr. Khoury's dissent. As for you, Mrs. Talbot, I am willing to accept your declaration of good faith, that you have done your best. You will of course commit yourself in writing to pay the balance. As for you, Mr. Khoury, if you are willful so am I. Whatever the box contains that relates to you will be turned over to the police at midnight. Archie, get the box and the key." Back to them: "We have procured a key that will serve." <==
Thinking it desirable to keep up appearances, I first got a Marley from the drawer and loaded it. Then to the cabinet for the key, and then to the safe. As I worked the combination my back was to them, but as I opened the door and took out the box I had an eye on them, not only for appearances. It was conceivable that Perdis or Khoury, or both, had come with the idea of getting something for nothing if a chance offered. All four of them had twisted around in their chairs to follow me, and they twisted back as I circled around to Wolfe's desk. As I was putting the box down the phone rang. It would. I was going to tell Wolfe to take it, but didn't have to.
He lifted the receiver. "Yes? ... Yes, Saul ... indeed ... That isn't necessary.... Satisfactory.... No, stay there, Archie is here ... How sure are you? ... Very satisfactory.... No, call again in an hour or so."
As he hung up there was a gleam in his eye. "Open it," he said. I inserted the key, fiddled with it a little, got it, lifted the lid all the way, stared a second for effect, and said, "It's empty," and when Perdis bounced up and came, my hand jerked up with the gun, not having been told that that part of the performance

 was over. I slipped the gun in my pocket and turned the box on its edge so that all could see the shiny inside. Perdis blurted at Wolfe, "Damn you! You've got it! You had a key!" Mrs. Oliver squawked something. Anne Talbot lowered her head and covered her face with her hands.

Jules Khoury stood up, vetoed whatever he had in - tended, and sat down again. He spoke. "Use your head, Perdis. He didn't even know it was empty. Why would he - "
"You're wrong," Wolfe snapped. "I did know it was empty. I knew it last night when I made my proposal."

They were speechless. Anne Talbot lifted her head.
==> "I made the proposal," Wolfe said, "not out of caprice, to plague you, but for a purpose, and the purpose has been served. You have the gun, Archie? Go and stand at the door. No one is to leave." <==
I obeyed. Perdis, still on his feet, was in the way, so I detoured around back of the chairs. He was yapping, and Khoury was up again. Of course I hadn't the dim - mest idea what was coming next as I shut the door and put my back to it, gun in hand, but apparently Wolfe had. Ignoring them, he had lifted the receiver and was dialing. Since he hadn't consulted the book and there were only three phone numbers he bothered to keep in his head, I knew who he must be getting, even before he spoke and asked for Mr. Cramer. In a moment he had him.
"Mr. Cramer? The situation has developed as I expected. How soon can you be here with Mrs. Hazen? ... No. I will not. I told you more than half an hour ago that I would almost certainly call you.... No. I told you that her presence would be essential. If you come without her you won't be admitted.... Yes. I am prepared to suggest a substitute.... Yes.... Yes!"
Mrs. Oliver was on her feet too; they all were, except for Anne Talbot, and as Wolfe hung up Perdis said through his teeth, "Damn you, you gave it to the police!"
"No," Wolfe said. "Are you a dunce? Would I contrive such a hocus-pocus just to pass the time? Confound it, sit down! I have something to say that you would prefer to hear before Mr. Cramer arrives."

 dressed, including an overcoat, and his hat was there on the ground. The usual items in his pockets, including a couple of dollars in change, except that there were no keys, and no wallet and no watch. Of course they could have been taken by someone who found him earlier and forgot to mention it. His name was on letters in his pocket, so the wallet wasn't taken to delay identification. Shot once, in the back, and a rib stopped the bullet and they have it. A thirty-two. Weapon not found. If the police have any leads or notions they're saving them, but of course it was found less than three hours ago." I glanced at my wrist. "Two hours and forty-nine minutes. Lon says he would have paid me five grand if I had kept Mrs. Hazen here until he could send a man to take her picture and ask her who shot her husband, and I told him I'll bear that in mind next time."
"They have the bullet?"
"Right."
"When will a policeman come?"
==> "It will probably be Cramer in person. You know how he'll react when he learns she was here. Say two hours, possibly sooner." <==
"Will she report what she told me?" "No."
A corner of his mouth twitched. "That's why I put up with you; you could have answered with fifty words and you did it with one."
"I've often wondered. Now tell me why I put up with you."
"That's beyond conjecture. I want a bullet that has been fired from that gun, and we shouldn't wait until after lunch. You have twenty minutes. If your guess about Mrs. Hazen is correct, that gun is not evidence, unless the murderer stole into that house afterwards, went to Mr. Hazen's room and returned the gun to the drawer, and slipped out again. If it is evidence you'll be tampering with it. Shall I do it?"
"No. You might shoot a toe off." I got the gun from the drawer, removed one of the cartridges, unlocked and opened the drawer where we keep the Marleys for which we have permits, and got a .32 cartridge from the box. I put that cartridge in the Drexel where I had made room for it, turned the cylinder so it would be in

"No. You might shoot a toe off." I got the gun from the drawer, removed one of the cartridges, unlocked and opened the drawer where we keep the Marleys for which we have permits, and got a .32 cartridge from the box. I put that cartridge in the Drexel where I had made room for it, turned the cylinder so it would be in

 firing position, went to the hall and downstairs to the storage room in the basement, switched the light on, and crossed to where a discarded mattress was doubled up on a table. I had used it for this operation before. I cocked the revolver, held it three inches from the mattress, and pulled the trigger.
You would suppose that all .32 cartridges would send a bullet the same distance into a mattress, the same mattress, but they don't. It took me a quarter of an hour to find it, and by the time I got back upstairs Wolfe was at table in the dining room, which is across the hall from the office. Before I joined him I removed the shell, returned the Drexel's own cartridge to its place, and put the gun in the safe and the bullet in an envelope in my desk drawer.
*
==> We were back in the office, Wolfe dictating and me taking, when company came. I had been right on both counts: it was Inspector Cramer in person, and it was 2:55 when the doorbell rang and I went to the hall for a look through the one-way glass panel in the front door, and there he was on the stoop, no sign of a sag in the heavy broad shoulders, the round red face framed by his turned-up overcoat collar and the brim of his gray felt which should have been retired long ago. Since he had no appointment it would have been proper to open the door the two inches allowed by the chain bolt and greet him through the crack, but that always annoyed him, and if it turned out that I had tampered with evidence it wouldn't hurt to show him now that I had my good points. So I pulled the door wide open. Without even a nod, let alone a civil greeting, he crossed the sill, tramped down the hall into the office and on to Wolfe's desk, and demanded, "What time did Mrs. Barry Hazen get here this morning?" <==
Wolfe tilted his head back to look up at him and inquired, "Is that snow on your hat?"
Having entered and detoured around him, I too looked at the hat. There was nothing whatever on it except signs of age, and outdoors the sun was shining.
It would fluster any man to have it put to him that one removes one's hat when one enters a house, but Cramer is ready for anything when he faces Wolfe. It didn't faze him. He merely barked, "I asked you a question!"
"Half past eleven," Wolfe said.

When did she leave?" "Shortly before one o'clock."
Cramer took his overcoat off, ignored my offer to take it, put it on the arm of the red leather chair, and sat. "An hour and a half," he said, not barking but a little hoarse. He is always a little hoarse when he is dealing with Wolfe. "What did she have to say?" He hadn't touched the hat.
Wolfe swiveled and leaned back. "Mr. Cramer. I know that Mrs. Hazen's husband has been shot and killed. She was with me when the news came on my radio. I know that when I have been consulted by a person who is in any way connected with a death by violence you automatically assume that I have knowledge of evidence that would be useful in your investigation. Sometimes your assumption is valid; sometimes it isn't. This time it isn't; that is my considered opinion. Mrs. Hazen consulted me in confidence. If at any time I have reason to think that by refusing to disclose what she told me I am obstructing justice, I'll communicate with you at once."

Cramer got a cigar from a pocket, rolled it between his palms, stuck it in his mouth, and clamped his teeth on it. He does that instead of counting ten, when he knows that the words that are on his tongue would make things worse instead of better. He took the cigar from his mouth. "Some day," he said, "you're going to fall off and get hurt, and this could be it. If and when you find it gets too hot to hang onto it any longer, and you turn loose, arid you have obstructed justice by not telling me now, I'll get your hide. Nothing and no one will stop me. I'm asking you to tell me what Mrs. Barry Hazen said when she came to see you nine hours after her husband was murdered."
Wolfe shook his head. "I decline to tell you because I believe, as matters stand now, that it is not pertinent to your inquiry. Should I have occasion to change my mind - and by the way, I can offer you an opportunity to change it for me. Archie, where's that bullet?"
I got the envelope from my drawer, took the bullet out, and handed it to him. Cramer's sharp gray eyes were on me and followed the bullet back to Wolfe.
Wolfe took it in his fingers, barely glanced at it, handed it back to me, and said, "Give it to Mr. Cramer." As I did so he turned to Cramer. "This will be pointless if you have found the weapon that was used to shoot Mr. Hazen. Have you?"

It would fluster any man to have it put to him that one removes one's hat when one enters a house, but Cramer is ready for anything when he faces Wolfe. It didn't faze him. He merely barked, "I asked you a question!"
"Half past eleven," Wolfe said.

When did she leave?" "Shortly before one o'clock."
Cramer took his overcoat off, ignored my offer to take it, put it on the arm of the red leather chair, and sat. "An hour and a half," he said, not barking but a little hoarse. He is always a little hoarse when he is dealing with Wolfe. "What did she have to say?" He hadn't touched the hat.
==> Wolfe swiveled and leaned back. "Mr. Cramer. I know that Mrs. Hazen's husband has been shot and killed. She was with me when the news came on my radio. I know that when I have been consulted by a person who is in any way connected with a death by violence you automatically assume that I have knowledge of evidence that would be useful in your investigation. Sometimes your assumption is valid; sometimes it isn't. This time it isn't; that is my considered opinion. Mrs. Hazen consulted me in confidence. If at any time I have reason to think that by refusing to disclose what she told me I am obstructing justice, I'll communicate with you at once." <==
Cramer got a cigar from a pocket, rolled it between his palms, stuck it in his mouth, and clamped his teeth on it. He does that instead of counting ten, when he knows that the words that are on his tongue would make things worse instead of better. He took the cigar from his mouth. "Some day," he said, "you're going to fall off and get hurt, and this could be it.

"Then I suggest that you have your laboratory compare that bullet with it. If you find that they were shot by the same gun let me know at once and I'll have some information for you. I would want to see the laboratory report, certified."

"I'll tell you, or I won't, when I get your report."
"By God." Cramer was hoarser. "This is pertinent. This is evidence. I'll take you down, both of you - "
"Nonsense. Evidence of what? I don't know and neither do you. If it wasn't fired by the gun that killed Mr. Hazen it is evidence of nothing, and I am not obliged to account for it until I know. I'm not indulging in a prank, Mr. Cramer. There is a possibility that the bullets will match, and if so it will indeed be evidence. Let me know."
Cramer opened his mouth to say something, vetoed it, got to his feet, put the bullet in his pocket, threw the cigar at my wastebasket and missed, picked up his coat and put it on, ignoring my offer to help, and marched out. I went to the hall to see that when the door shut he was on the outside. When I returned to the office Wolfe growled. "Confound these interruptions. We have forty minutes.

I sat, got my notebook, and told him.

At four o'clock, when he left to go up to the plant rooms for his two-hour afternoon session with the orchids, I got busy at the typewriter.

Cramer had left at 3:20. He would lose no time getting the bullet to the laboratory; they probably had it by 3:50, or four o'clock at the latest. Examining two bullets with a comparison

It was a million to one that the murderer hadn't sneaked into the house to put the gun back in the drawer in Hazen's room; why would he? Murderers often do crazy things, but not that crazy. Therefore Mrs. Hazen had lied, and she had either killed him or knew who did, and I was a beetlehead. I had to do three of the letters twice.
By six o'clock, when Wolfe came down from the plant rooms, I had begun to relax. He went to his desk and started on the letters I had put there, which he always reads with care. After he had finished a couple and signed them I remarked, "Of course Cramer wouldn't bother to phone if the bullets didn't match."
He grunted.
"And the laboratory got it more than two hours ago, so we might as well - " The doorbell rang, and the bottom of my spine curled.
==> Cramer had waited until six o'clock, when he knew Wolfe would be available. I went to the hall and switched the stoop light on, and my spine went back to normal. It was a stranger, a man about my age, maybe a little younger, with no hat and a mop of brown hair shuffled by the wind. I had never been so delighted to see a stranger, but had it under control by the time I got to the door and opened it and said, "Yes, sir?" <==
"I want to see Nero Wolfe. My name's Weed, Theodore Weed."
I should have had him wait there while I went and told Wolfe, that was the routine, but I was so glad to see him that I invited him in and helped him off with his coat. Then I went to the office and announced, "Theodore Weed to see you. One of the dinner guests. The one who - "
"What does he want?"

"Sure, about a dozen. Fifteen altogether, as of yesterday. His total take was over a quarter of a million a year."
Wolfe looked up at the clock. "It will be my dinner time in five minutes. If my assumption that Mrs. Hazen didn't kill her husband is correct, and if you didn't, who did?"
That question gets a helpful answer about once in a hundred times. It was obvious that Weed had given it no brain room at all before he rang our doorbell, because he had either thought that Lucy had done it or known that he had, so he had no guesses ready. He was more than willing; the idea appealed to him; but he had to start from scratch, and five minutes wasn't enough. He thought that Wolfe should forget about dinner, though he didn't say so, which was just as well. He said he would return after dinner, but Wolfe said no, if he would leave

 his phone number he would hear from us. He would have left the bills there on Wolfe's desk if I hadn't handed them to him.
==> By the time we had finished dinner and were back in the office, with coffee, I had no personal worry. If the bullets had matched we would have heard from Cramer by then. Wolfe got at the letters to sign, still on his desk, and as he finished the last one and I took it he spoke. <==
"Did Mr. Weed shoot him?"
I shook my head. "No comment. I'd have to flip a coin."
He cleared up one point, anyway, about her. You said that no one wants to kill a man merely because she despises him. Sure. So what was eating her? Weed.
He says she doesn't know how he feels about her and the feeling is not returned. Nuts. Either he lies or he's simple. Of the ten thousand women I have fallen in love with, every single one of them knew it before I did. As for Weed shooting him, I am split. It would be tough to send her a bill for nailing him, but if he didn't you've got a job. Where do you start? Apparently Hazen was the kind of specimen - "
The doorbell rang. Could Cramer possibly have held off so long? No. It would be Weed, to help some more.

No. It was a more familiar figure, a tall thin middle-aged man in a dark gray overcoat that had been cut to give him more shoulder, but not overdoing it. Nathaniel Parker had his clothes made by Stover. When I opened the door and greeted and admitted him he headed for the office, keeping his coat on and his homburg in his hand, and I followed. He was one of the eight men, not counting me, that Wolfe shook hands with. He declined Wolfe's invitation to be seated, saying that he was an hour and a half late for a dinner appointment. "I stopped in instead of phoning," he said, "because I had to deliver this." He took a key from his pocket and handed it to me. "That's the key to Mrs. Hazen's house. Also this." From his inside pocket he took a folded paper. "That's authority from her to enter and get something. What you're to get, if you want to, is an iron box - she said iron but I suppose it's tin or steel - that is under the bottom drawer of the chest in Hazen's bedroom. You remove the drawer and pry up the board that it slides in on, and the box is underneath. She doesn't know what's in it. One day about a year ago Hazen lifted the board and showed her the box, and told her

 that if he died she was to get the box, have it opened by a locksmith, and bum the contents without looking at them. I thought you might want to have a look, and she is willing. You'll be acting for her, through her attorney."
Wolfe grunted. "I'll use my discretion."
"I know you will. If you don't want to tell me what was in it you'll say it was empty. I'd like to be present when it's opened, but I have an appointment. As for her, what did she tell you this morning?"

"No. I had them strip and went through their clothes. They say the maid let them in. She's not here; of course they greased her. Perdis just offered me fifty grand to go away and forget I was here. I'll split it with you. He would probably double it."
"Pfui. Are you intact?"
"Sure. I'm calling just to tell you to expect us, say in half an hour, maybe less."
Silence. He would have to work, not tomorrow, but now - and two women. Then: "I suppose I must," and he hung up.
Perdis had joined the others at the wall. As I cradled the phone he spoke. "We will double it. One hundred thousand dollars."
==> "Skip it." I moved to the foot of the bed. "What would I tell my wife if I had one? You heard me tell Nero Wolfe to expect us in half an hour, but you have a choice. You can leave and go your ways and try to forget you were here, and I'll phone Inspector Cramer and report this incident, omitting nothing. Or you can come and talk it over with Nero Wolfe, and he may or may not care to bother Cramer about it. You may have two minutes to consider it." I looked at my wrist. <==
"Listen, Mr. Goodwin," Anne Talbot said. She had her clothes on, and with or without them she was highly ornamental. "We were looking for something that belongs to us. We're not thieves. We're respectable - "
I cut her off. "Sorry, but don't waste it on me. I just run errands. It's either Nero Wolfe or the police. If you pick Nero Wolfe there will be a slight delay because I have a little chore to do in this room. You will take your things and go downstairs and on out, and get two taxis. You will get into one of the taxis and wait there in front of the house, and have the other one there for me. I'll be down soon, probably in a couple of minutes. There's one complication: if you split and one or two of you prefer to go somewhere else, I'll phone the police immediately. I would rather not, but I'd have to."
Two of them, Perdis and Mrs. Oliver, started to speak, but I shut them off and moved away from the bed. Anne Talbot went to the bed and got her coat, and Khoury went and held it for her, and then got his own. Anne Talbot said to Perdis and Mrs. Oliver, "Is there any alternative?" Perdis went and got Mrs.

 Oliver's coat and took it to her, and she went to the bed for her bag.

When they were out, and the door shut, and I returned to the office, Wolfe was out from behind his desk.
"A notion," I said. "Mrs. Hazen may be out on bail by the middle of the morning and accessible to them, and you're up in the plant rooms until eleven o'clock, not to be disturbed. Even if she's locked up, those people have lawyers and connections, Perdis especially. He may play poker with the DA. I could phone Parker to see her in the morning and tell her that no matter what she hears you're not loony, you're just a genius, and you know where you're headed for even when nobody else does, including me."
"Not necessary." He went to the door and turned.
"Make sure that the safe's locked. I'm tired. Good night."
He knows darned well that I always make sure the safe's locked, but of course it doesn't often have something in it that's supposed to be worth a million bucks.
==> Up in my room on the third floor, as I undressed I made assorted tries at deciding what was next on his program, and didn't like any of them. As it turned out the next thing on the program wasn't decided either by me or by him, but by Inspector Cramer. In the morning Wolfe came down from the plant rooms at eleven o'clock as usual, and also as usual I had the mail opened and the dusting done and fresh water in the vase on his desk. He went first to the front of the desk to put a spray of orchids in the vase, Odontoglossum pyramus, then circled around to his chair. As he sat the doorbell rang. I went to the office door for a look and told him it was Cramer. He slapped a palm on the desk, glared at me, and said nothing, and I went to the front and opened up. I didn't like the look on Cramer's face as he entered and let me take his coat and hat. He almost grinned at me, and he didn't stride to the office, he just walked. He sat in the red leather chair, crossed his legs comfortably, and told Wolfe, "I haven't got much time. I want to hear it from you, what Mrs. Hazen came to you for yesterday, just the substance, and then Goodwin will come downtown and get it down in a statement, all of it. With his wonderful memory." <==
Wolfe was glowering at him. "Mr. Cramer. It shouldn't be - "
"Save it. She's booked for murder. We have the gun. Hazen got his car from the garage Monday night. It has been found parked on Twenty-first Street. There

 was a gun in the dashboard compartment, and it fired the bullet that killed him. We have traced it. It was bought by Hazen six years ago and he had a permit for it. He kept it in a drawer in his bedroom, and the maid saw it there yesterday morning when she went up to see why he hadn't come down for breakfast. Don't ask me why Mrs. Hazen took it from there afterwards and went to where she had parked the car on Twenty-first Street and put it in the car. I don't know, but maybe you do. So let's hear you."

==> I squeezed my eyes shut because if I had kept them open they would have popped, and I didn't want to give Cramer that satisfaction. But I am supposed to help Wolfe when he needs it, and right then he sure could use a few seconds to arrange his mind, so I opened my eyes and asked Cramer, just curious, "What kind of a gun?" <==
He ignored it. He was having too good a time looking at Wolfe to bother with me. Wolfe was paying me another compliment. I was responsible for our assumption that Mrs. Hazen was innocent, but he didn't glance at me. He lowered his chin, scratched the tip of his nose, regarded Cramer for ten seconds, and then turned to me.
"Archie. It may be desirable to have a record of what Mr. Cramer just said. Type it. Verbatim. Double-spaced, one carbon."
As I got at the typewriter Cramer said, "I don't object. Naturally you've got to stall while you try to figure a way to climb down without breaking your neck."
No comment from Wolfe. I put in paper and hit the keys. Since I had had years of practice reporting long and involved conversations that had had time to fade, that one was no trick at all. As I rolled the paper out Wolfe said, "Initial the original," and I did so, and handed it to him. He read it through, in no hurry, took his pen and initialed it, handed it back to me, and turned to Cramer.
"I'm not stalling," he said. "If what you just told me is true, your demand for information is warranted. If it isn't true you're gulling me into disclosing a confidential communication from a client, and I want a record - "

 Hazen left with me yesterday. If you'll agree - "
"She left a gun with you?"
"Yes. I'll tell you about it, and give it to you, if you will give me its history at the earliest possible moment. I want your word."
"You won't get it. Mrs. Hazen is charged with murder. If she left a gun with you it's evidence in a murder investigation."
Wolfe shook his head. "No. It's evidence in my investigation, but not in yours. You have your gun, the one the murderer used. How can it embarrass you to tell me about this one?"
==> Cramer considered it. "You're going to tell me what she said about it." "I am." <==
"Okay. Go ahead."
"I have your word?"
"Yes."
"Get the gun, Archie."
I went to the safe and squatted to twirl the knob. Ordinarily I leave it unlocked when I'm in the office, but with that box in it I was taking no chances, so after I had worked the combination and got the gun I shut the door and turned the knob. As I crossed to Cramer I spoke.

"By the way, I asked a question that wasn't answered. What make is your gun? The one that killed him."
"Drexel thirty-two."
"So's this." I handed it to him. "Of course there are millions of Drexel thirty- twos."
He gave it a look, and darned if he didn't sniff it. As I said, that's automatic. Also he flipped the cylinder open for a glance.

Wolfe unloaded. He didn't enjoy it and neither did I, spilling it, but we had to know about the gun and it might have taken us days. He skipped the details, including no quotes, but gave it straight, both parts, before the news came over the radio and after. He didn't include my reasons for deciding that she hadn't shot her husband, but I didn't mind; it might have got Cramer confused and that would have been a pity. He was a little confused anyhow; toward the end he was frowning, pulling at his lip now and then, a wary look in his eyes. When Wolfe finished he sat looking at it before he spoke.
"What have you left out?" he demanded.
Wolfe shook his head. "Nothing material. You said you wanted the substance; you have it. How long will it take to trace the gun?"
"I don't get it. After she came to you with that fairy tale, and the news came about her husband, and you learned that we were holding her, you took her for a client? I don't get it. I have never known you to take a murderer for a client. Whether it's just your goddamn luck, or what, I don't know, but you haven't. Why did you take her?"
A corner of Wolfe's mouth turned up. "I asked Mr. Goodwin's opinion and he said she was innocent. His judgment of women under thirty is infallible. How long will it take to trace the gun?"

He gave it a look, and darned if he didn't sniff it. As I said, that's automatic. Also he flipped the cylinder open for a glance.


"It was fired yesterday," Wolfe said, "by Mr. Goodwin, to get a bullet. The bullet I gave you."
Cramer nodded. "Yeah. There's nothing on God's earth you wouldn't do. It could have been ... What the hell, it wasn't. Okay, let's hear you."
==> Wolfe unloaded. He didn't enjoy it and neither did I, spilling it, but we had to know about the gun and it might have taken us days.

"Nuts." Cramer stood up. "Maybe an hour, maybe a week. I'm taking Goodwin. They'll take his statement at the District Attorney's office, a complete report of the conversation. I'll have a man here at two o'clock to take yours. If I took you down you'd only - "

"I shall sign no statement. I am not obliged to. If you send a man he won't be admitted. If you have questions, ask them."
Cramer's round red face got redder. But that was as far as it went; his memory of what had happened on the three occasions he had taken Wolfe downtown was

 presumably what stopped him. He stuck the gun in his pocket and turned to me. "Come on, Goodwin. We'll see."
As I arose the phone rang and I reached to get it. It was Nathaniel Parker. He was upset. "Archie? Nat Parker. Mrs. Hazen is being held on a charge of homicide, of course without bail. I want to see Wolfe before I see her. I have to know what she told him yesterday. I'll be there in twenty minutes."

During the next nine hours I had various opportunities to try to sort it out. En route in a police car to the DA's office, later from there to Homicide West on 20th Street, and several waiting periods while assorted officers of the law, including the DA himself at one point, decided what to do next.
It was complicated enough even before an assistant DA kindly permitted me to use a phone, around three o'clock, and I called Wolfe. Of course the game was button, button, who had the gun when and where?
Either gun. If Lucy Hazen had lied, how much? Had the gun that the maid had seen in the drawer Tuesday morning been the one that had shot Hazen or the one she had brought to Wolfe? If the former, Lucy was a liar and also either was a murderer or could name him. If the latter, who had put it in the drawer and when? And why? It wasn't that there were no possible answers; there were too many. And too many of them made it too likely that Lucy had made a monkey of me and therefore were not acceptable.

It wasn't that there were no possible answers; there were too many. And too many of them made it too likely that Lucy had made a monkey of me and therefore were not acceptable.
The first hour or so I was entertained by an assistant DA named Mandel, who was not a stranger to me, and a Homicide Bureau lieutenant, and it was obvious that the gun puzzle was as tough for them as it was for me, though they didn't say so. Then, while we were having sandwiches and coffee, no recess called, at Mandel's desk, a phone call came for him, and he took the lieutenant to another room, and when they returned their attitude was quite different. Apparently they were no longer interested in guns; they concentrated on what Lucy had said to Wolfe and me, her exact words; and finally, a little before three o'clock, Mandel called a stenographer in and told me to start dictating my statement. Of course the room was wired for sound, and they would have fun later comparing my dictated statement with what I had told them. It was then that I insisted on making a phone call and was escorted to a booth.
I got Wolfe. "Me. In a booth at the DA's office, and it may be tapped. They should be finished with me by the end of the week. They were curious about guns, and then a phone call came and they weren't. I thought you might like to know."
==> "I already know." He didn't sound depressed. "Mr. Cramer phoned shortly after one. The gun we gave him had been traced without difficulty. It was purchased <==

 by Mrs. Hazen's father, Titus Postel, in 1953, and he committed suicide with it five years ago, in 1955."
"And she had it?"
"Not established. I have told Mr. Parker to ask her when he sees her this afternoon. Meanwhile I have got Saul and given him an errand."
I would have liked to ask him what errand, but that wasn't advisable since we might have company on the line. Saul Panzer, the first and best man on our list when we need help, charges more than any other freelance operative in New York, and is worth five times as much. I told Wolfe I might or might not be home for dinner.

Saul Panzer, the first and best man on our list when we need help, charges more than any other freelance operative in New York, and is worth five times as much. I told Wolfe I might or might not be home for dinner.
Dictating my statement to the stenographer, I had to keep jerking my mind back to it. The gun puzzle was okay now for the cops, since they had tagged Lucy; now they didn't have to buy it that she had been nutty enough to take the gun home after she shot him and put it in the drawer, and the next day get it and take it back to the car. It was much neater. She had got the gun from the drawer Monday, put the one she had, that had been her father's, in its place, and left it in the car after she shot him. And Tuesday she had got the gun from the drawer and brought it to Wolfe as a prop for her fairy tale, evidently not knowing that guns have numbers that can be traced. What better could you ask for?
==> But for me, unless I was ready to give Lucy up as a bad job, it was what worse could I ask for. Before, there had been too many answers; now there weren't any. I had to file it while I dictated my statement, in which I was supposed to include everything Lucy had said to us in Wolfe's office, and while I went over it after it was typed, and it wasn't easy. Then I was taken to the office of the DA himself, and he and Mandel pecked at me for an hour; and when they finished, around 6:30, and I supposed that was all for the day, I was informed that Cramer wanted me at Homicide West. If I had balked they would have booked me as a material witness and Parker couldn't come to the rescue until morning, so I took it. <==
In one respect it was an improvement. The dick at Homicide West whom Cramer sent for sandwiches happened to be civilized enough to think that even a dog has a right to eat what he likes, and I got what I asked for, corned beef on rye and milk. Except for that, it was just more of the same, for more than two hours with Cramer and Sergeant Purley Stebbins. I didn't even have the satisfaction of getting a chance to break my record with Lieutenant Rowcliff. I once got him

 stuttering in two minutes and twenty seconds, and I have a bet with Saul Panzer that I can do it in two minutes flat with three more tries.
Cramer and Stebbins finally decided they had had enough of me. It was 9:32 by my watch, and 9:34 by the clock on the wall, which was wrong, as I crossed the reception room of the precinct house to the door, and on out. I stood on the sidewalk for three good breaths of the cold fresh air, giving my lungs a treat and deciding which way to turn. If right, toward Eighth Avenue, it would be for a taxi; if left, toward Ninth, it would be for a fifteen-minute walk. Voting for the walk, I moved, and had taken three steps when my shoulder was grabbed and yanked from behind and a voice came, with feeling: "You dirty rat!"
The yank had turned me some and I turned myself the rest of the way. It was Theodore Weed. His hands were fists, and the right one was back a foot, with the elbow bent. His eyes were blazing and his bony jaw was set.

 was over. I slipped the gun in my pocket and turned the box on its edge so that all could see the shiny inside. Perdis blurted at Wolfe, "Damn you! You've got it! You had a key!" Mrs. Oliver squawked something. Anne Talbot lowered her head and covered her face with her hands.
Jules Khoury stood up, vetoed whatever he had in - tended, and sat down again. He spoke. "Use your head, Perdis. He didn't even know it was empty. Why would he - "
"You're wrong," Wolfe snapped. "I did know it was empty. I knew it last night when I made my proposal."
They were speechless. Anne Talbot lifted her head.
"I made the proposal," Wolfe said, "not out of caprice, to plague you, but for a purpose, and the purpose has been served. You have the gun, Archie? Go and stand at the door. No one is to leave."
==> I obeyed. Perdis, still on his feet, was in the way, so I detoured around back of the chairs. He was yapping, and Khoury was up again. Of course I hadn't the dim - mest idea what was coming next as I shut the door and put my back to it, gun in hand, but apparently Wolfe had. Ignoring them, he had lifted the receiver and was dialing. Since he hadn't consulted the book and there were only three phone numbers he bothered to keep in his head, I knew who he must be getting, even before he spoke and asked for Mr. Cramer. In a moment he had him. <==
"Mr. Cramer? The situation has developed as I expected. How soon can you be here with Mrs. Hazen? ... No. I will not. I told you more than half an hour ago that I would almost certainly call you.... No. I told you that her presence would be essential. If you come without her you won't be admitted.... Yes. I am prepared to suggest a substitute.... Yes.... Yes!"
Mrs. Oliver was on her feet too; they all were, except for Anne Talbot, and as Wolfe hung up Perdis said through his teeth, "Damn you, you gave it to the police!"
"No," Wolfe said. "Are you a dunce? Would I contrive such a hocus-pocus just to pass the time? Confound it, sit down! I have something to say that you would prefer to hear before Mr. Cramer arrives."

I'm leaving," Mrs. Oliver said. "This was all a trick and you'll regret it. I'm going."

Khoury, with his chair right back of his knees, merely had to bend them. Perdis, going to his chair, jostled Mrs. Oliver and didn't apologize. She turned to face me at the door, decided that Wolfe was right, I wouldn't have to shoot, and sat.
"You heard me on the phone," Wolfe told them. "Mr. Cramer will be here shortly, and Mrs. Hazen will be with him. The nature of your peculiar relations with Mr. Hazen will have to be divulged to him, that can't be helped, but he doesn't have to know of your invasion of that house yesterday evening. It's only fair - don't interrupt me, there isn't much time - "

"No," Wolfe said. "Are you a dunce? Would I contrive such a hocus-pocus just to pass the time? Confound it, sit down! I have something to say that you would prefer to hear before Mr. Cramer arrives."

I'm leaving," Mrs. Oliver said. "This was all a trick and you'll regret it. I'm going."
"No one is going. Mr. Goodwin wouldn't shoot you, but he wouldn't have to. Sit down."
Khoury, with his chair right back of his knees, merely had to bend them. Perdis, going to his chair, jostled Mrs. Oliver and didn't apologize. She turned to face me at the door, decided that Wolfe was right, I wouldn't have to shoot, and sat.

The nature of your peculiar relations with Mr. Hazen will have to be divulged to him, that can't be helped, but he doesn't have to know of your invasion of that house yesterday evening. It's only fair - don't interrupt me, there isn't much time - " <==
Perdis persisted. "You have no evidence of our relations with Hazen."
"Pfui. Your bid to Mr. Goodwin? It's only fair that three of you should know about the box. All that I told you about it last evening was true - Mr. Hazen showing it to his wife and telling her that if he died she should get it and burn the contents, and Mr. Goodwin getting it from beneath the drawer after sending you from the room. Asked by Mr. Perdis if I had opened it, I said no. But Mr. Goodwin had, and it was empty."
"I don't believe it," Mrs. Oliver said. "It's a trick."
Wolfe nodded. "I concocted a trick, that's true, but it's a fact that the box was empty. That's what you have a right to know, three of you. It's an understatement to say that you would like to know where the former contents are, but I have no idea and neither has Mr. Goodwin, and I'm sure Mrs. Hazen hasn't. The obvious conjecture is that Mr. Hazen transferred them to some other place which he preferred. If I could offer - "
"She has them," Mrs. Oliver said harshly. "Lucy Hazen. I suppose you don't know it or you wouldn't have had us come ready to pay. She took them after she killed him and now we'll have her. She'll be in prison but we'll have her the rest of our lives."

"I don't believe it," Anne Talbot said. She hadn't spoken since the box had been opened. "Lucy wouldn't do that. But this is even worse than it was.... Now we

 don't know ... and I tried so hard...."
"I don't believe the box was empty," Khoury told Wolfe. "I think you're lying."
"I don't," Perdis said. "Why would he? There's six hundred and five thousand dollars here ready for him."
==> His eyes went to Wolfe. "But this Cramer - that's Inspector Cramer? You said he has to know about what you call our peculiar relations with Hazen. Why does he?" <==
The doorbell rang. I was on post and could have let Fritz take it, but they were all in their chairs, so I opened the door to the hall and stepped through. I expected to see Cramer alone, since there hadn't been time for him to get Lucy from the jug, but she was there with him on the stoop, and at her elbow was
Sergeant Purley Stebbins. He must have had her brought to 20th Street when Wolfe made his first phone call. And as I dropped the gun in my pocket and moved, the door to the front room opened and Theodore Weed darted out and to the front door. He couldn't possibly have heard through the soundproofed wall and door, so either he had been looking out a window or his feeling for her included some kind of a personal electronic receiver.
Seeing no reason to spoil his fun, I let him open the door. Cramer shot him a glance as he entered. Lucy crossed the threshold, saw him, and stopped. She stared, and he stared back. He lifted a hand and let it drop. Stebbins, back of her, growled, "On in, Mrs. Hazen." She looked at me, and back at Weed, and I said, "Everything's under control, Mrs. Hazen," and Weed backed up a step. I thought, and still think, that he had intended to warn her that Wolfe and I were a pair of Judases, but the mere sight of her paralyzed him. He stood and stared while Cramer and Stebbins got their coats off and I took hers and put it on a hanger. When we headed for the office he followed us, and there was no point in herding him back to the front room. Either Wolfe had the cards or he hadn't.
Three steps in, Cramer stopped to send his eyes around. I didn't envy him any. The four people there weren't a bunch of bums, anything but; they had position and connections and lawyers if necessary, and much wampum. And here he was, in the office of a private detective, with a woman charged with murder.
Of course he had a good reason: he suspected he might have stubbed his toe. I hadn't been present when Wolfe had made his previous phone call, but

Three of them - "
"The objects are here?" Cramer demanded.
"No. I don't know where they are. I have never seen them. The people are here. This will go better if you keep your questions until I'm through. Three of them - Mrs. Oliver, Mrs. Talbot, and Mr. Perdis - came prepared to pay, and that was what I was after. I was acting on the premise, certainly worth a test, that one of Hazen's victims had killed him, and to kill him might have been futile unless he got the object or objects that had made it possible for Hazen to bleed him. For a moment I abandon fact for surmise. Mr. Khoury did get the object or objects. By some ruse, probably with the promise of a large sum of money as a lure, he induced Hazen to get his car from the garage Monday night and drive somewhere, and to have with him the object or objects. That surmise is not haphazard. The others came here this evening prepared to pay, but not Mr. Khoury. He knew I had nothing to support my threat. Even when I told him that the objects pertaining to him would be given to the police in ninety minutes he was unmoved."
"Get back to facts," Cramer growled. His head turned. "Mr. Khoury, do you want to comment?"

"But I can," he told her. "Item, you have in your bag a check for two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. For what? Account for it. I advise you, madam, to

 hold your tongue. I would prefer to tell Mr. Cramer only what I must to support my suggestion, and I'll go beyond that only if you force me to. You shouldn't have challenged me. Now that you have, were the amounts that you paid Mr. Hazen, ostensibly for professional services, actually paid under coercion?"
She looked down at the bag in her lap, looked up again, and said, "Yes."
"Then don't interrupt me." Wolfe returned to Cramer. "Mr. Hazen had in his possession various objects, I don't know what, to substantiate his demands. Last evening I told these four people that I had secured these objects and that I would surrender them for one million dollars, giving them twenty-four hours to meet my terms. They are here. Three of them - "
==> "The objects are here?" Cramer demanded. <==
"No. I don't know where they are. I have never seen them. The people are here. This will go better if you keep your questions until I'm through. Three of them - Mrs. Oliver, Mrs. Talbot, and Mr. Perdis - came prepared to pay, and that was what I was after. I was acting on the premise, certainly worth a test, that one of Hazen's victims had killed him, and to kill him might have been futile unless he got the object or objects that had made it possible for Hazen to bleed him. For a moment I abandon fact for surmise. Mr. Khoury did get the object or objects. By some ruse, probably with the promise of a large sum of money as a lure, he induced Hazen to get his car from the garage Monday night and drive somewhere, and to have with him the object or objects. That surmise is not haphazard. The others came here this evening prepared to pay, but not Mr. Khoury. He knew I had nothing to support my threat. Even when I told him that the objects pertaining to him would be given to the police in ninety minutes he was unmoved."
"Get back to facts," Cramer growled. His head turned. "Mr. Khoury, do you want to comment?"
"No." From Khoury's smile you might have thought he was enjoying it. "This is fascinating. I thought I had decided not to bring my share of the million because I didn't believe he had anything that threatened anybody."

In that conversation he introduced topics that obviously referred to the pinch he had them in - for instance, poison. I don't know which of those present that touched, and am not concerned. But one of his topics pointed clearly at Mr. Khoury. He remarked that his wife's father had been a great inventor, a genius; and his wife's father, Titus Postel, had been associated with Mr. Khoury. So it seemed likely that his hold on Mr. Khoury was in some way connected with Titus Postel, but at the time I learned that, yesterday evening, I had no reason to single out Mr. Khoury for special attention, so I merely noted it for possible future application."

Shortly after one o'clock you phoned me to say that the gun I had given you had been the property of Titus Postel and that he had committed suicide with it five years ago; and soon after that, on the telephone with Mr. Khoury, he informed me that he would be present this evening but that he was declining my proposal. He didn't put it in those terms, but that was the gist."
Khoury made a noise, a subdued snort. Cramer said, "Yes, Mr. Khoury?" "Nothing," Khoury said.

Wolfe resumed. "Now the guns. Call them Gun H, Mr. Hazen's, the one he was shot with, left in his car; and Gun P, Mr. Postel's, which I gave you this morning. My account of them is not established fact, but it is more than mere surmise because it is based on a high degree of probability. When Mr. Khoury went to that grotesque dinner party Monday evening he had Gun P with him. During the -"
"You can prove he had it?"
"Certainly not. I'm telling you what happened, not what I can prove. During the evening he found or made an opportunity to go to Mr. Hazen's bedroom, took Gun H from the drawer, and put Gun P in its place. With a double purpose: first, and minor, so that Hazen would find a gun there - they were the same make - if he looked for it. Second, and major, to implicate Mrs. Hazen. He intended to leave Gun H in the car after he killed Hazen. The police would of course learn that it had been Hazen's, kept in that drawer in his room, and when they found Gun P there in its place, the gun that had belonged to Mrs. Hazen's father, they

 would naturally assume that she had put it there in a witless effort to mislead them. By the way." His head turned. "Mrs. Hazen. The gun that had belonged to your father - was it in your possession?"

"Yes. And your former employer is not only a murderer, he tried to make you his scapegoat. You have been unfortunate in your choice of male associates, but I can relieve your mind about one you didn't choose, your father. He didn't commit suicide; he was murdered. By Mr. Khoury."
"No," Khoury said. "Another one? You're piling it on."
Wolfe leveled his eyes at him. "Your aplomb is admirable, sir," he said, no sarcasm. "Of course you're counting on what I said at the beginning, that I have no evidence. You're too sanguine. The evidence almost certainly exists, but to get it will require authority and a large trained staff, and I have neither. I am obliged to Mr. Hazen for a valuable hint, his remark that Mrs. Hazen's father was a great inventor and a genius. That suggested that you might have cheated him

 out of the proceeds of his genius, and immediately after talking with you on the phone today I put a man on it."
==> Wolfe fumed to Cramer. "The man was Saul Panzer. You know his capacities. He phoned me about an hour ago, just before I called you, and what he reported was the basis for my statement to Mrs. Hazen, that Khoury killed her father. I don't tell you what he reported because you will get it from him, and also because I don't want Mr. Khoury to know what has been uncovered, and neither do you. As I said, I am only offering a suggestion, but I trust it is cogent enough to persuade you to restrict Mr. Khoury's movements, and to put some men to work. He may have taken Hazen's keys on the chance that they might be useful, and he may still have them, though not on his person. Find them. Ransack his premises. He may even still have the object or objects he certainly took; find them. If you see his wife before he is allowed to communicate with her you may learn something about Gun P." He flipped a hand. "But this is superfluous; you know your job. If I have - " <==
Khoury had moved. No rush, he wasn't a bit disturbed, but he was on his feet. "Really," he said, "there's a limit." His straight line to the door was in front of Mrs. Oliver and Perdis and Lucy, but it would have been bad manners to cross their bows, so he started around. On past Mrs. Oliver, and Perdis, and Lucy, with Stebbins at her shoulder, before Cramer spoke. "Stop him, Purley." Khoury whirled, saying through his teeth, "Don't touch me."
"Nuts," Purley said, and began going over him for a gun. Gun X, maybe. Anyway, Khoury couldn't have made it to the hall because Theodore Weed was there filling the door.

I'll have to leave it with two loose ends.
First, the object or objects pertaining to AnneTalbot, Mrs. Oliver, Perdis, and presumably other assorted Hazen clients. They have never turned up. At least, the cops never found them. If one of the clients did, he didn't announce it. So if the hints Hazen scattered around at the dinner party aroused your curiosity, I can't satisfy it.

==> Second, the fee that Wolfe had certainly earned. Lucy refused to take any of Hazen's leavings; she wouldn't even take the house. That was noble, and even decent, considering how he had got it, but private detectives have to eat. Unquestionably Nero Wolfe has to eat. There's a chance that she'll get a chunk of Khoury's pile eventually, on account of the evidence Cramer dug up that Khoury had stolen a couple of Titus Postel's inventions, but Khoury, who is now in the death house while his lawyers hop around from court to court, has admitted nothing, and neither has his wife. So if you're curious as to how much Wolfe collected for his thirty-six hours' work I can't satisfy you on that either. <==
As for a third point you might be curious about, whether Lucy and Theodore Weed have found out how they feel about each other, you may have one guess. If you need more than one, what do you suppose makes the world go around?

"Not established. I have told Mr. Parker to ask her when he sees her this afternoon. Meanwhile I have got Saul and given him an errand."
I would have liked to ask him what errand, but that wasn't advisable since we might have company on the line. Saul Panzer, the first and best man on our list when we need help, charges more than any other freelance operative in New York, and is worth five times as much. I told Wolfe I might or might not be home for dinner.
Dictating my statement to the stenographer, I had to keep jerking my mind back to it. The gun puzzle was okay now for the cops, since they had tagged Lucy; now they didn't have to buy it that she had been nutty enough to take the gun home after she shot him and put it in the drawer, and the next day get it and take it back to the car. It was much neater. She had got the gun from the drawer Monday, put the one she had, that had been her father's, in its place, and left it in the car after she shot him. And Tuesday she had got the gun from the drawer and brought it to Wolfe as a prop for her fairy tale, evidently not knowing that guns have numbers that can be traced. What better could you ask for?
But for me, unless I was ready to give Lucy up as a bad job, it was what worse could I ask for. Before, there had been too many answers; now there weren't any. I had to file it while I dictated my statement, in which I was supposed to include everything Lucy had said to us in Wolfe's office, and while I went over it after it was typed, and it wasn't easy. Then I was taken to the office of the DA himself, and he and Mandel pecked at me for an hour; and when they finished, around 6:30, and I supposed that was all for the day, I was informed that Cramer wanted me at Homicide West. If I had balked they would have booked me as a material witness and Parker couldn't come to the rescue until morning, so I took it.
==> In one respect it was an improvement. The dick at Homicide West whom Cramer sent for sandwiches happened to be civilized enough to think that even a dog has a right to eat what he likes, and I got what I asked for, corned beef on rye and milk. Except for that, it was just more of the same, for more than two hours with Cramer and Sergeant Purley Stebbins. I didn't even have the satisfaction of getting a chance to break my record with Lieutenant Rowcliff. I once got him <==

 stuttering in two minutes and twenty seconds, and I have a bet with Saul Panzer that I can do it in two minutes flat with three more tries.
Cramer and Stebbins finally decided they had had enough of me. It was 9:32 by my watch, and 9:34 by the clock on the wall, which was wrong, as I crossed the reception room of the precinct house to the door, and on out. I stood on the sidewalk for three good breaths of the cold fresh air, giving my lungs a treat and deciding which way to turn. If right, toward Eighth Avenue, it would be for a taxi; if left, toward Ninth, it would be for a fifteen-minute walk. Voting for the walk, I moved, and had taken three steps when my shoulder was grabbed and yanked from behind and a voice came, with feeling: "You dirty rat!"
The yank had turned me some and I turned myself the rest of the way. It was Theodore Weed. His hands were fists, and the right one was back a foot, with the elbow bent. His eyes were blazing and his bony jaw was set.
"Not here, you damn fool," I said. "Even if you drop me with one swing, which is doubtful, I'll yell police as I go down and here they'll come. Besides, I have a right to know why I'm a rat while I'm still conscious. Why?"

 don't know ... and I tried so hard...."
"I don't believe the box was empty," Khoury told Wolfe. "I think you're lying."
"I don't," Perdis said. "Why would he? There's six hundred and five thousand dollars here ready for him."
His eyes went to Wolfe. "But this Cramer - that's Inspector Cramer? You said he has to know about what you call our peculiar relations with Hazen. Why does he?"
The doorbell rang. I was on post and could have let Fritz take it, but they were all in their chairs, so I opened the door to the hall and stepped through. I expected to see Cramer alone, since there hadn't been time for him to get Lucy from the jug, but she was there with him on the stoop, and at her elbow was
==> Sergeant Purley Stebbins. He must have had her brought to 20th Street when Wolfe made his first phone call. And as I dropped the gun in my pocket and moved, the door to the front room opened and Theodore Weed darted out and to the front door. He couldn't possibly have heard through the soundproofed wall and door, so either he had been looking out a window or his feeling for her included some kind of a personal electronic receiver. <==
Seeing no reason to spoil his fun, I let him open the door. Cramer shot him a glance as he entered. Lucy crossed the threshold, saw him, and stopped. She stared, and he stared back. He lifted a hand and let it drop. Stebbins, back of her, growled, "On in, Mrs. Hazen." She looked at me, and back at Weed, and I said, "Everything's under control, Mrs. Hazen," and Weed backed up a step. I thought, and still think, that he had intended to warn her that Wolfe and I were a pair of Judases, but the mere sight of her paralyzed him. He stood and stared while Cramer and Stebbins got their coats off and I took hers and put it on a hanger. When we headed for the office he followed us, and there was no point in herding him back to the front room. Either Wolfe had the cards or he hadn't.
Three steps in, Cramer stopped to send his eyes around. I didn't envy him any. The four people there weren't a bunch of bums, anything but; they had position and connections and lawyers if necessary, and much wampum. And here he was, in the office of a private detective, with a woman charged with murder.
Of course he had a good reason: he suspected he might have stubbed his toe. I hadn't been present when Wolfe had made his previous phone call, but

 presumably he had said that he expected soon to be ready to offer a substitute for Mrs. Hazen, and Cramer knew Wolfe only too well.

"No," Khoury said. "Another one? You're piling it on."
Wolfe leveled his eyes at him. "Your aplomb is admirable, sir," he said, no sarcasm. "Of course you're counting on what I said at the beginning, that I have no evidence. You're too sanguine. The evidence almost certainly exists, but to get it will require authority and a large trained staff, and I have neither. I am obliged to Mr. Hazen for a valuable hint, his remark that Mrs. Hazen's father was a great inventor and a genius. That suggested that you might have cheated him

 out of the proceeds of his genius, and immediately after talking with you on the phone today I put a man on it."
Wolfe fumed to Cramer. "The man was Saul Panzer. You know his capacities. He phoned me about an hour ago, just before I called you, and what he reported was the basis for my statement to Mrs. Hazen, that Khoury killed her father. I don't tell you what he reported because you will get it from him, and also because I don't want Mr. Khoury to know what has been uncovered, and neither do you. As I said, I am only offering a suggestion, but I trust it is cogent enough to persuade you to restrict Mr. Khoury's movements, and to put some men to work. He may have taken Hazen's keys on the chance that they might be useful, and he may still have them, though not on his person. Find them. Ransack his premises. He may even still have the object or objects he certainly took; find them. If you see his wife before he is allowed to communicate with her you may learn something about Gun P." He flipped a hand. "But this is superfluous; you know your job. If I have - "
==> Khoury had moved. No rush, he wasn't a bit disturbed, but he was on his feet. "Really," he said, "there's a limit." His straight line to the door was in front of Mrs. Oliver and Perdis and Lucy, but it would have been bad manners to cross their bows, so he started around. On past Mrs. Oliver, and Perdis, and Lucy, with Stebbins at her shoulder, before Cramer spoke. "Stop him, Purley." Khoury whirled, saying through his teeth, "Don't touch me." <==
"Nuts," Purley said, and began going over him for a gun. Gun X, maybe. Anyway, Khoury couldn't have made it to the hall because Theodore Weed was there filling the door.

Chapter 10
I'll have to leave it with two loose ends.
First, the object or objects pertaining to AnneTalbot, Mrs. Oliver, Perdis, and presumably other assorted Hazen clients. They have never turned up. At least, the cops never found them. If one of the clients did, he didn't announce it. So if the hints Hazen scattered around at the dinner party aroused your curiosity, I can't satisfy it.

If one of the clients did, he didn't announce it. So if the hints Hazen scattered around at the dinner party aroused your curiosity, I can't satisfy it.
Second, the fee that Wolfe had certainly earned. Lucy refused to take any of Hazen's leavings; she wouldn't even take the house. That was noble, and even decent, considering how he had got it, but private detectives have to eat. Unquestionably Nero Wolfe has to eat. There's a chance that she'll get a chunk of Khoury's pile eventually, on account of the evidence Cramer dug up that Khoury had stolen a couple of Titus Postel's inventions, but Khoury, who is now in the death house while his lawyers hop around from court to court, has admitted nothing, and neither has his wife. So if you're curious as to how much Wolfe collected for his thirty-six hours' work I can't satisfy you on that either.

"It will be a pleasure," I said, and meant it, but Wolfe was pushing back his chair. "Mr. Goodwin doesn't owe you the ten minutes. I do," he said, lifting his bulk.
"Come with me. You won't need your coat." He headed for the door. She gave me a glance with a suggestion of a smile, and followed him out. The sound came from the hall of the elevator door opening and closing.
I had no kick coming. The ten thousand orchids in the three plant rooms up on the roof of the old brownstone were his, not mine. He did like to show them off - so would you if they were yours - but that wasn't why he had intervened. He had some letters to dictate, and he thought that if I took her up to look at the orchids there was no telling when we would come back down.

Years ago he decided, on insufficient evidence, that I forget about time when I am with an attractive young woman, and once he has decided something that settles it.
==> The phone rang. I got it at my desk and told it, "Nero Wolfe's office, Archie Goodwin speaking." It was a man over in Jersey who makes sausage to Wolfe's specifications, wanting to know if we were ready for a shipment, and I switched it to Fritz in the kitchen. Thinking there was no better way for a licensed detective to fill idle time than by snooping, I picked up the mink coat for an inspection. When I saw that the label said Bergmann I decided that inspection would be superfluous and put it back on the chair. I picked up the gun that she wasn't going to shoot her husband with. It was a Drexel .32, nice and clean, and the cylinder was full of cartridges, nothing for a lady with no permit to be toting around town. I inspected her check, East Side Bank and Trust Company, signed Lucy Hazen, and went and put it in the safe. After glancing at my watch, I turned on the radio for the noon news, and stood and stretched while <==
I listened to it. Algeria was boiling. A building contractor on Staten Island denied that he had had favors from a politician. Fidel Castro was telling the Cuban people that the people who ran the United States government were a bunch of bums (my translation). Then:
"The body of a man named Barry Hazen was found this morning in an alley between two buildings on Norton Street in the lower West Side of Manhattan. He had been shot in the back and had been dead for some hours. No further details are available at present. Mr. Hazen was a well-known public-relations counselor. The Democratic leaders in Congress have apparently decided to center their fire - "
I turned it off.

 guess has not been discredited, we'll see."
He pushed his chair back and stood up.
She rose to her feet, steady this time, and I went and held her coat for her.

Chapter 3
==> When I returned to the office after letting her out, Wolfe had straightened up in his chair to lean forward, and, with his head cocked, was sniffing the air. For a second I thought he was pretending that our ex-client had polluted the atmosphere with perfume, but then I realized that he was merely trying to catch an odor from the kitchen, where Fritz was baking scallops in shells - or probably, since I could catch the odor without sniffing, he was deciding whether Fritz had used only shallots in the sauce or had added an onion. By the time I got to my chair he had settled it; anyway, he turned to me. <==
"I do not intend," he stated, "to serve the convenience of a murderer. What about her face? I was at one side."
"One will get you fifty," I said. "You heard her stutter that I was m - m - making it up. Then when I said no, he had been shot dead and it hit her as a fact, she went white, all white, in three seconds. Maybe she can wiggle her ears, but she can't do that. No one can."
"Very well. Call Mr. Cohen and get details."
"Anything in particular?"
"Whatever he has, but I want to know if the weapon has been found, or a bullet."

"Intrusion and presumption," Wolfe said, "and now effrontery. I must insist - "
"Damn it, I know she did! She told me so! She was here when she heard about it, that they had found his body! And she wanted to hire you, she wanted to give you a check, and you wouldn't take it!" He paused to control his jaw. "So I want to hire you, and I'll pay your bill. I just left the District Attorney's office and she's still there. They wouldn't let me see her, but she's there and they're going to charge her with murder. I can't see why it's presumption for me to want to hire you - you're in the detective business and my money is as good as anybody's. All right, I got ahead of myself asking you about the gun, but when I'm your client there's no reason why you shouldn't tell me where it is."
He stuck a hand in his pocket and brought out a wad of bills, not a thick one, and unfolded it.
I was trying to decide. Either he thought that Lucy Hazen had killed her husband, and was being chivalrous, or he didn't think she had but was selling Wolfe the idea that he did think so. Whichever it was, he was willing to spend money on it, for he got up from his chair to put the bills on Wolfe's desk.

==> As Wolfe started to speak the phone rang, and I turned and got it. It was Lucy Hazen. She asked for Wolfe, and I told her to hold it and turned to him. "The woman that brought the sausage this morning wants to know if it will do. If you want to ask Fritz you can talk on the kitchen extension." <==
He got up and went, and I held on. In a moment his voice was in my ear. "This is Nero Wolfe. Mrs. Hazen?"
"Yes. You said this morning that if I need your services you would see." Her voice was shaky. "I do need them. I'm going to be arrested, and I - "
"Where are you?"
"At the District Attorney's. I don't know any - "
"Say only what you must say on the telephone."

"Soak your head some more. We're working for her, not you."
No comment until the cab was turning into 35th Street, then: "I don't think she killed him."
"Good for you. We appreciate it."
"And I didn't."
"That's not so important, but we'll keep it in mind."
==> At the curb in front of the old brownstone there was a black limousine with a chauffeur in it. That would be Mrs. Oliver's. Mounting the seven steps to the stoop, I used my key, but the chain bolt was on and I had to ring for Fritz. As he took Weed's coat and I disposed of mine, he said, "Thank God, Archie, thank God," and I asked him what for, and he said, "For you. It has been very bad. Three phone calls during dinner, and that woman was in the front room." <==
"I can imagine. How many are in there now?" "Three. Her and two men."
So Khoury had come. I took Weed to the office. Wolfe was at his desk with a book. Weed headed for him, talking. "I want to know why - "
"Shut up!" Wolfe bellowed.
Wolfe's bellow would stop a tiger ready to spring.
Weed stood and glared at him. Wolfe finished a paragraph, inserted his marker,

"I want to know why you gave the gun - "
"Bah. Are you a jackass? You must be, to suppose you can call me to account. Sit down! You said you would give an arm to help Mrs. Hazen. Keep your arm; I want only some information. Must I repeat my question?"
Five of the yellow chairs were there. Weed took the nearest one. He ran his fingers through his mop of hair, but only a comb and brush could have handled it. "Mrs. Oliver was there," he said. "And Khoury. Perdis and Mrs. Talbot came soon after I did. I don't see why - "
"This is what I want to know. While you were there, was any one of them absent from the gathering long enough to go to Mr. Hazen's bedroom and back? Consider it. Dismiss your fatuous huff for the moment and put your mind on something pertinent."
Weed tried to. To do so he had to take his eyes from Wolfe, so he tilted his head back and looked at the ceiling. He took his time, then lowered his head. "I don't think so. I'm pretty sure none of them left the room at all, either before we went to the dining room or after. Of course they were all there when I left, so - "
==> The doorbell rang. I went to the hall, but Fritz was there opening the door. When the newcomer had crossed the sill I stepped back into the office and gave Wolfe a nod, and he asked, "Mrs. Talbot?" <==
"Yes, sir."
"Mr. Weed to the hall, then bring them in, and Mr. Weed to the front room. We may need him later."
"I'm staying right here," Weed declared, "until I - "
"You are not. I have work to do and no time to bicker with you. Out. Out!" "But damn it - "
"Out."

 don't know ... and I tried so hard...."
"I don't believe the box was empty," Khoury told Wolfe. "I think you're lying."
"I don't," Perdis said. "Why would he? There's six hundred and five thousand dollars here ready for him."
His eyes went to Wolfe. "But this Cramer - that's Inspector Cramer? You said he has to know about what you call our peculiar relations with Hazen. Why does he?"
==> The doorbell rang. I was on post and could have let Fritz take it, but they were all in their chairs, so I opened the door to the hall and stepped through. I expected to see Cramer alone, since there hadn't been time for him to get Lucy from the jug, but she was there with him on the stoop, and at her elbow was <==
Sergeant Purley Stebbins. He must have had her brought to 20th Street when Wolfe made his first phone call. And as I dropped the gun in my pocket and moved, the door to the front room opened and Theodore Weed darted out and to the front door. He couldn't possibly have heard through the soundproofed wall and door, so either he had been looking out a window or his feeling for her included some kind of a personal electronic receiver.
Seeing no reason to spoil his fun, I let him open the door. Cramer shot him a glance as he entered. Lucy crossed the threshold, saw him, and stopped. She stared, and he stared back. He lifted a hand and let it drop. Stebbins, back of her, growled, "On in, Mrs. Hazen." She looked at me, and back at Weed, and I said, "Everything's under control, Mrs. Hazen," and Weed backed up a step. I thought, and still think, that he had intended to warn her that Wolfe and I were a pair of Judases, but the mere sight of her paralyzed him. He stood and stared while Cramer and Stebbins got their coats off and I took hers and put it on a hanger. When we headed for the office he followed us, and there was no point in herding him back to the front room. Either Wolfe had the cards or he hadn't.
Three steps in, Cramer stopped to send his eyes around. I didn't envy him any. The four people there weren't a bunch of bums, anything but; they had position and connections and lawyers if necessary, and much wampum. And here he was, in the office of a private detective, with a woman charged with murder.
Of course he had a good reason: he suspected he might have stubbed his toe. I hadn't been present when Wolfe had made his previous phone call, but
