==> IT WAS nothing out of the ordinary that Mrs. Barry Rackham had made the appointment with her finger pressed to her lips. That is by no means an unusual gesture for people who find themselves in a situation where the best thing they can think of is to make arrangements to see Nero Wolfe. <==
With Mrs. Barry Rackham the shushing finger was only figurative, since she made the date speaking to me on the phone. It was in her voice, low and jerky, and also in the way she kept telling me how confidential it was, even after I solemnly assured her that we rarely notified the press when someone requested an appointment on business. At the end she told me once more that she would have preferred to speak to Mr. Wolfe himself, and I hung up and decided it rated a discreet routine check on a prospective client, starting with Mr. Mitchell at the bank and Lon Cohen at the Gazette. On the main point of interest, could she and did she pay her bills, the news was favorable: she was worth a good four million and maybe five. Calling it four, and assuming that Wolfe's bill for services rendered would come to only half of it, that would be enough to pay my current salary - as Wolfe's secretary, trusted assistant and official gnat - for a hundred and sixty-seven years; and in addition to that, living as I did there in Wolfe's house, I also got food and shelter. So I was fixed for life if it turned out that she needed two million bucks' worth of detective work.
She might have at that, judging from the way she looked and acted at 11:05 the next morning, Friday, when the doorbell rang and I went to let her in. There was a man on the stoop with her, and after glancing quickly east and then west she brushed past him and darted inside, grabbed my sleeve, and told me in a loud whisper, "You're not Nero Wolfe!" Instantly she released me, seized the elbow of her companion to hurry him across the sill, and whispered at him explosively, "Come in and shut the door!" You might have thought she was a duchess diving into a hock shop.

ot that she was my idea of a duchess physically. As I attended to the door and got the man's hat and topcoat hung on the rack, I took them in.
She was a paradox - bony from the neck up and ample from the neck down. On her chin and jawbone and cheekbone the skin was stretched tight, but alongside her mouth and nose were tangles of wrinkles.

"You were trembling all the way down here in the car," the man said in a mild baritone.
"I was not!" she snapped. That settled, she turned to me. "This is my cousin, Calvin Leeds. He didn't want me to come here, but I brought him along anyhow. Where's Mr. Wolfe?"
I indicated the door to the office, went and opened it, and ushered them in.

This time he kept his seat behind his desk in the corner near a window, merely nodding and murmuring when I pronounced names. I thought for a second that Mrs. Rackham was standing gazing at him in reproach for his bad manners, but then I saw it was just surprised disbelief that he could be that big and fat. I'm so used to the quantity of him that I'm apt to forget how he must impress people seeing him for the first time.
He aimed a thumb at the red leather chair beyond the end of his desk and muttered at her, "Sit down, madam."

She went and sat. I then did likewise, at my own desk, not far from Wolfe's and at right angles to it. Calvin Leeds, the cousin, had sat twice, first on the couch toward the rear and then on a chair which I moved up for him.

I would have guessed that both he and Mrs. Rackham had first seen the light about the same time as the twentieth century, but he could have been a little older. He had a lot of weather in his face with its tough-looking hide, his hair had been brown but was now more gray, and with his medium size and weight he looked and moved as if all his inside springs were still sound and lively. He had taken Wolfe in, and the surroundings too, and now his eyes were on his cousin.

Mrs. Rackham spoke to Wolfe. "You couldn't very well go around finding out things. Could you?"
"I don't know," he said politely. "I haven't tried for years, and I don't intend to. Others go around for me." He gestured at me. "Mr. Goodwin, of course, and others as required. You need someone to go around?"

"Then you shouldn't have come," Leeds said mildly. "Then you have come too soon," Wolfe told her. "Too soon? Why?"
"You should have waited until it became so urgent or so intolerable that it would cause you no shame to ask for help, especially from one as expensive as me." He shook his head. "Too soon. Come back if and when you must."

Wolfe's head jerked around to me, to give me a look intended to scorch.
But I met his eyes and told him emphatically, "No, sir. If it is, she fibbed. I told her we wouldn't touch divorce or separation evidence, and she said it wasn't."

Mrs. Rackham's jaw started to quiver. She looked at Leeds. His brows went up, and he shook his head, not as a negative apparently, but merely leaving it to her. Wolfe let out a grunt. She moved her eyes to him and said plaintively, "I'm neurotic."
"I am not," Wolfe snapped, "a psychiatrist. I doubt if - "
She cut him off. "I've been neurotic as long as I can remember. I had no brother or sister and my mother died when I was three, and my father didn't enjoy my company because I was ugly. When he died - I was twenty then - I cried all during the funeral service, not because he was dead but because I knew he wouldn't have wanted me so close to him all that time - in the church and driving to the cemetery and there at the grave."
Her jaw started to quiver again, but she damped it and got control. "I'm telling you this because it's no secret anyway, and I want you to understand why I must have help. I have never been sure exactly why my first husband married me, because he had money of his own and didn't really need mine, but it wasn't long until he hated looking at me just as my father had. So I - "
"That isn't true, Sarah," Calvin Leeds objected. "You imagined - "

"Do you suspect him of infidelity?"
"No! I don't!"
Wolfe grunted, leaned back in his chair, squirmed to get comfortable, and muttered, "Tell me about it."
==> Mrs. Rackham's jaw started to quiver. She looked at Leeds. His brows went up, and he shook his head, not as a negative apparently, but merely leaving it to her. Wolfe let out a grunt. She moved her eyes to him and said plaintively, "I'm neurotic." <==
"I am not," Wolfe snapped, "a psychiatrist. I doubt if - "
She cut him off. "I've been neurotic as long as I can remember. I had no brother or sister and my mother died when I was three, and my father didn't enjoy my company because I was ugly. When he died - I was twenty then - I cried all during the funeral service, not because he was dead but because I knew he wouldn't have wanted me so close to him all that time - in the church and driving to the cemetery and there at the grave."
Her jaw started to quiver again, but she damped it and got control. "I'm telling you this because it's no secret anyway, and I want you to understand why I must have help. I have never been sure exactly why my first husband married me, because he had money of his own and didn't really need mine, but it wasn't long until he hated looking at me just as my father had. So I - "
"That isn't true, Sarah," Calvin Leeds objected. "You imagined - "
"Bosh!" she quashed him. "I'm not that neurotic! So I got a divorce with his consent and gratitude, I think, though lie was too polite to say so, and I hurried it through because I didn't want him to know I was pregnant. Soon after the divorce my son was born, and that made complications, but I kept him - I kept him and he was mine until he went to war. He never showed the slightest sign of feeling about my looks the way my father and my husband had. He was never embarrassed about me. He liked being with me. Didn't he, Calvin?"

Of course he did," Leeds assured her, apparently meaning it.
==> She nodded and looked thoughtful, looking into space and seeing something not there. She jerked herself impatiently back to Wolfe. "I admit that before he went away, to war, he got married, and he married a very beautiful girl. It is not true that I wished he had taken one who resembled me, even a little bit, but naturally I couldn't help but see that he had gone to the other extreme. Annabel is very beautiful. It made me proud for my son to have her - it seemed to even my score with all the beautiful women I had known and seen. She thinks I hate her, but that is not true. People as neurotic as I am should not be judged by normal standards. Not that I blame Annabel, for I know perfectly well that when the news came that he had been killed in Germany her loss was greater than mine. He wasn't mine any longer then, he was hers." <==
"Excuse me," Wolfe put in politely but firmly. "You wanted to consult me about your husband. You say you're divorced?"
"Certainly not! I - " She caught herself up. "Oh. This is my second husband. I only wanted you to understand."
"I'll try. Let's have him now."
"Barry Rackham," she said, pronouncing the name as if she held the copyright on it, or at least a lease on subsidiary rights. "He played football at Yale and then had a job in Wall Street until the war came. At the end of the war he was a major, which wasn't very far to get in nearly four years. We we're married in 1946 - three years and seven months ago. He is ten years younger than I am."
Mrs. Barry Rackham paused, her eyes fixed on Wolfe's face as if challenging it for comment, but the challenge was declined. Wolfe merely prodded her with a murmur.

"And?"
"I suppose," she said as if conceding a point, "there is no one in New York who does not take it for granted that he married me simply for my money. They all know more about it than I do, because I have never asked him, and he is the only one that knows for sure. I know one thing: it does not make him uncomfortable to look at me. I know that for sure because I'm very sensitive about it, I'm neurotic about it, and I would know it the first second he felt that way. Of course he knows what I look like, he knows how ugly I am, he can't help that, but it

 doesn't annoy him a particle, not even – "
She stopped and was blushing. Calvin Leeds coughed and shifted in his chair. Wolfe closed his eyes and after a moment opened them again. I didn't look away from her because when she blushed I began to feel a little uncomfortable myself, and I wanted to see if I could keep her from knowing it.

But she wasn't interested in me. "Anyway," she went on as the color began to leave, "I have kept things in my own hands. We live in my house, of course, town and country, and I pay everything, and there are the cars and so on, but I made no settlement and arranged no allowance for him. That didn't seem to me to be the way to handle it. When he needed cash for anything he asked for it and I gave it to him freely, without asking questions." She made a little gesture, a flip of a hand. "Not always, but nearly always. The second year it was more than the first, and the third year more again, and I felt he was getting unreasonable. Three times I gave him less than he asked for, quite a lot less, and once I refused altogether - I still asked no questions, but he told me why he needed it and tried to persuade me; he was very nice about it, and I refused. I felt that I must draw the line somewhere. Do you want to know the amounts?"
"Not urgently," Wolfe muttered.
"The last time, the time I refused, it was fifteen thousand dollars." She leaned forward. "And that was the last time. It was seven months ago, October second, and he has not asked for money since, not once! But he spends a great deal, more than formerly. For all sorts of things - just last week he gave a dinner, quite expensive, for thirty-eight men at the University Club. I have to know where he gets it. I decided that some time ago - two months ago - and I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to speak to my lawyer or banker about a thing like this, or in fact anybody, and I couldn't do it myself, so I asked my cousin, Calvin Leeds." She sent him a glance. "He said he would try to find out something, but he hasn't."
We looked at Leeds. He upturned a palm.
"Well," he said, half apology and half protest, "I'm no trained detective. I asked him straight, and he just laughed at me. You didn't want anyone else to get a hint of it, that you were curious about money he wasn't getting from you, so I was pretty limited in my asking around. I did my best, Sarah, you know I did."

Wolfe grunted, and she was at him. "I know! You think I feel that I've bought him and I own him! That's not it at all! All I really want is to be like a wife, just any wife - not beautiful and not ugly, not rich and not poor - just a wife! And hasn't a wife a right to know the source of her husband's income - isn't it her duty to know? If you had a wife wouldn't you want her to know?"
Wolfe made a face. "I can tell you, madam, what I don't want. I don't want this job. I think you're gulling me. You suspect that your husband is swindling you, either emotionally or financially, and you want me to catch him at it" He turned to me, "Archie. You'll have to change that formula.

You're not ugly and afraid and neurotic like me, you're big and handsome and successful and not afraid of anything.

I just want to pay you for finding out where and how my husband is getting money, that's all. You can't possibly say you won't do it. Not possibly!"
She left her chair and went to put the check on his desk in front of him.
"It's for ten thousand dollars, but that doesn't mean I think that's enough. Whatever you say. But don't you dare say I want to expose him! My God - expose him?"

"Maybe it was. Why not?"
"Not with my husband." She was positive. "I know how he is with money. It isn't in him to make an investment. Another thing: he is away more now. I don't know where he is as much as I used to. I don't mean weeks or even days, just an afternoon or evening - and several times he has had an appointment that he couldn't break when I wanted him to - "
Wolfe grunted, and she was at him. "I know! You think I feel that I've bought him and I own him! That's not it at all! All I really want is to be like a wife, just any wife - not beautiful and not ugly, not rich and not poor - just a wife! And hasn't a wife a right to know the source of her husband's income - isn't it her duty to know? If you had a wife wouldn't you want her to know?"
Wolfe made a face. "I can tell you, madam, what I don't want. I don't want this job. I think you're gulling me. You suspect that your husband is swindling you, either emotionally or financially, and you want me to catch him at it" He turned to me, "Archie. You'll have to change that formula. Hereafter, when a request comes for an appointment, do not say merely that we will not undertake to get divorce or separation evidence. Make it clear that we will not engage to expose a husband for a wife, or a wife for a husband, under any camouflage. May I ask what you are doing, Mrs. Rackham?"
She had opened her brown leather handbag and taken out a checkfold and a little gold fountain pen. Resting the checkfold on the bag, she was writing in it with the pen. Wolfe's question got no reply until she had finished writing, torn out the check, returned the fold and pen to the bag, and snapped the bag shut. Then she looked at him.
==> "I don't want you to expose my husband, Mr. Wolfe." She was holding the check with her thumb and fingertip. "God knows I don't! I just want to know. You're not ugly and afraid and neurotic like me, you're big and handsome and successful and not afraid of anything. When I knew I had to have help and my cousin couldn't do it, and I wouldn't go to anyone I knew, I went about it very carefully.

"It's for ten thousand dollars, but that doesn't mean I think that's enough. Whatever you say. But don't you dare say I want to expose him! My God - expose him?"
She had my sympathy up to a point, but what stuck out was her basic assumption that rich people can always get anything they want just by putting up the dough. That's enough to give an honest workingman, like a private detective for instance, a pain in three places. The assumption is of course sound in some cases, but what rich people are apt not to understand is that there are important exceptions. This, however, was not one of them, and I hoped Wolfe would see that it wasn't. He did. He didn't want to, but the bank account had by no means fully recovered from the awful blow of March fifteenth, only three weeks back, and he knew it. He came forward in his chair for a glance at the check, caught my eye and saw how I felt about it, heaved a sigh, and spoke.

"Your notebook, Archie. Confound it."
THE following morning, Saturday, I was in the office typing the final report on a case which I will not identify by name because it was never allowed to get within a mile of a newspaper or a microphone. We were committed on Mrs. Rackham's job, since I had deposited her check Friday afternoon, but no move had been made yet, not even a phone call to any of the names she had given us, because it was Wolfe's idea that first of all we must have a look at him. With Wolfe's settled policy of never leaving his house on business, and with no plausible excuse for getting Barry Rackham to the office, I would have to do the looking, and that had been arranged for.
Mrs. Rackham had insisted that her husband must positively not know or even suspect that he was being investigated, and neither must anyone else, so the arrangements for the look were a little complicated. She vetoed my suggestion

 that I should be invited to join a small weekend gathering at her country home in Westchester, on the ground that someone would probably recognize the Archie Goodwin who worked for Nero Wolfe. It was Calvin Leeds who offered an amendment that was adopted. He had a little place of his own at the edge of her estate, where he raised dogs, called Hillside Kennels. A month ago one of his valuable dogs had been poisoned, and I was to go there Saturday afternoon as myself, a detective named Archie Goodwin, to investigate the poisoning. His cousin would invite him to her place, Birchvale, for dinner, and I would go along.

It was a quiet Saturday morning in the office, with Wolfe up in the plant rooms as usual from nine to eleven, and I finished typing the report of a certain case with no interruptions except a couple of phone calls which I handled myself, and one for which I had to give Wolfe a buzz - from somebody at Mummiani's on Fulton Street to say that they had just got eight pounds of fresh sausage from Bill Darst at Hackettstown, and Wolfe could have half of it. Since Wolfe regards Darst as the best sausage maker west of Cherbourg, he asked that it be sent immediately by messenger, and for heaven's sake not with dry ice.
When, at 11:00, the sound of Wolfe's elevator came, I got the big dictionary in front of me on my desk, opened to H, and was bent over it as he entered the office, crossed to his oversized custom-built chair, and sat. He didn't bite at once because his mind was elsewhere. Even before he rang for beer he asked, "Has the sausage come?"

He pressed the button twice - the beer signal - leaned back, and frowned at me. I didn't see the frown, absorbed as I was in the dictionary, but it was in his tone of voice.
"What are you looking up?" he demanded.

"Fritz, good news. We're getting some of Mr. Darst's sausage - four pounds." Fritz let his eyes gleam. "Ha! Today?"
"Any moment." Wolfe poured beer. "That raises the question of cloves again. What do you think?"
"I'm against it," Fritz said firmly.
Wolfe nodded. "I think I agree. I think I do. You may remember what Marko Vukcic said last year - and by the way, he must be invited for a taste of this. For Monday luncheon?"
"That would be possible," Fritz conceded, "but we have arranged for shad with roe - "

I signed the slip, shut the door, started back down the hall, and was met not only by Fritz but by Wolfe too, who can move well enough when there's something he thinks is worth moving for.

The small carton was sealed with tape. In the kitchen Wolfe put it on the long table, reached to the rack for a knife, cut the tape, and pulled the flaps up. My reflexes are quick, and the instant the hissing noise started I grabbed Wolfe's arm to haul him back, yelling at Fritz, "Watch out! Drop!"
Wolfe can move all right, considering what he has to move. He and I went through the open door into the hall before the explosion came, and Fritz came bounding after, pulling the door with him. We all kept going, along the short stretch of hall to the office door, and into the office. There we stopped dead. No explosion yet.

At that point Archie had to go answer the doorbell, which I was glad to do.
I fully appreciate, mostly anyhow, the results of Wolfe's and Fritz's pow-wows on grub when it arrives at the table, but the gab often strikes me as overdone. So I didn't mind the call to the hall and the front door. There I found a young man with a pug nose and a package, wearing a cap that said "Fleet Messenger Service." I signed the slip, shut the door, started back down the hall, and was met not only by Fritz but by Wolfe too, who can move well enough when there's something he thinks is worth moving for.
He took the package from me and headed for the kitchen, followed by Fritz and

 me.
==> The small carton was sealed with tape. In the kitchen Wolfe put it on the long table, reached to the rack for a knife, cut the tape, and pulled the flaps up. My reflexes are quick, and the instant the hissing noise started I grabbed Wolfe's arm to haul him back, yelling at Fritz, "Watch out! Drop!" <==
Wolfe can move all right, considering what he has to move. He and I went through the open door into the hall before the explosion came, and Fritz came bounding after, pulling the door with him. We all kept going, along the short stretch of hall to the office door, and into the office. There we stopped dead. No explosion yet.
"It's still hissing," I said, and moved. "Come back here'" Wolfe commanded.
"Be quiet," I commanded back, and dropped to my hands and knees and made it into the hall. There I stopped to sniff, crawled to within a yard of the crack under the kitchen door, and sniffed again.
I arose, returned to the office on my feet, and told them. "Gas. Tear gas, I think. The hissing has stopped."
Wolfe snorted.

I marched to the hall and shut the door behind me, went and opened the front door wide, came back and stood at the kitchen door and took a full breath, opened the door, raced through and opened the back door into the courtyard, and ran back again to the front. Even there the air current was too gassy for comfort, so I moved out to the stoop. I had been there only a moment when I heard my name called.
"Archie!"

==> I turned. Wolfe's head with its big oblong face was protruding from a window of the front room. <==
"Yes, sir," I said brightly.
"Who brought that package?"
I told him Fleet Messenger Service.
When the breeze through the hall had cleared the air I returned to the kitchen and Fritz joined me - We gave the package a look and found it was quite simple: a metal cylinder with a valve, with a brass rod that had been adjusted so that when the package was opened so was the valve. There was still a strong smell, close up, and Fritz took it to the basement. I went to the office and found Wolfe behind his desk, busy at the phone. I dropped into my chair and dabbed at my runny eyes with my handkerchief. When he hung up I asked, "Any luck?"
"I didn't expect any," he growled. "Right. Shall I call a cop?"

"The question was not rhetorical," Wolfe said rudely. "That is not what rhetorical means."
"No? I asked it. I meant it to be rhetorical. Can you prove that I don't know what rhetorical means?" I blew my nose. "When you ask me a question, which God knows is often, do I assume - "

The phone rang. One of the million things I do to earn my salary is to answer it, so I did. And then a funny thing happened. There is absolutely no question that it was a shock to me to hear that voice, I know that, because I felt it in my stomach. But partly what makes a shock a shock is that it is unexpected, and I do not think the sound of that voice in my ear was unexpected. I think that Wolfe

I obeyed. He rested his elbows on his chair arms, interlaced his fingers in front of where he was roundest, and gazed at a corner of his desk blotter.
I did not, as a matter of fact, have anything to say except that it was a lousy break, and that didn't need saying. Wolfe had once ordered me to forget that I had ever heard the name Arnold Zeck, but whether I called him Zeck or Whosis or X, he was still the man who, some ten months ago, had arranged for two guys with an SM and a tommy gun to open up on Wolfe's plant rooms from a roof across the street, thereby ruining ten thousand dollars' worth of glass and equipment and turning eight thousand valuable orchid plants into a good start on a compost heap. That had been intended just for a warning.
Now he was telling us to lay off of Barry Rackham. That probably meant that without turning a finger we had found the answer to Mrs. Rackham's question - where was her husband getting his pocket money? He had got inside the circle of Arnold Zeck's operations, about which Wolfe had once remarked that all of them were illegal and some of them were morally repulsive. And Zeck didn't want any snooping around one of his men. That was almost certainly the sketch, but whether it was or not, the fact remained that we had run smack into Zeck again, which was fully as bad as having a gob of Darst sausage turn into a cylinder of tear gas.
"He likes to time things right, damn him," I complained. "He likes to make things dramatic. He had someone within range of this house to see the package being delivered, and when I left the front door open and then went and stood on the stoop that showed that the package had been opened, and as soon as he got the word he phoned. Hell, he might even - "

Wolfe had once ordered me to forget that I had ever heard the name Arnold Zeck, but whether I called him Zeck or Whosis or X, he was still the man who, some ten months ago, had arranged for two guys with an SM and a tommy gun to open up on Wolfe's plant rooms from a roof across the street, thereby ruining ten thousand dollars' worth of glass and equipment and turning eight thousand valuable orchid plants into a good start on a compost heap. That had been intended just for a warning.
Now he was telling us to lay off of Barry Rackham. That probably meant that without turning a finger we had found the answer to Mrs. Rackham's question - where was her husband getting his pocket money? He had got inside the circle of Arnold Zeck's operations, about which Wolfe had once remarked that all of them were illegal and some of them were morally repulsive. And Zeck didn't want any snooping around one of his men. That was almost certainly the sketch, but whether it was or not, the fact remained that we had run smack into Zeck again, which was fully as bad as having a gob of Darst sausage turn into a cylinder of tear gas.
"He likes to time things right, damn him," I complained. "He likes to make things dramatic. He had someone within range of this house to see the package being delivered, and when I left the front door open and then went and stood on the stoop that showed that the package had been opened, and as soon as he got the word he phoned. Hell, he might even - "
I stopped because I saw that I was talking to myself. Wolfe wasn't hearing me. He still sat gazing at the corner of the blotter. I shut my trap and sat and gazed at him. It was a good five minutes before he spoke.

Wolfe took the phone from his ear and placed it on the cradle. Since the effect of that would be lost it my line stayed open, I did likewise, practically simultaneously.
"By God, we're off again," I began. "Of all the rotten - " "Shut up," Wolfe growled.
I obeyed. He rested his elbows on his chair arms, interlaced his fingers in front of where he was roundest, and gazed at a corner of his desk blotter.

"How many cases have we handled since last July?" "All kinds? Everything? Oh, forty."
"I would have thought more. Very well, say forty. We crossed this man's path inadvertently two years ago, and again last year. He and I both deal with crime, and his net is spread wide, so that may be taken as a reasonable expectation for the future; once a year, or in one out of every forty cases that come to us, we will run into him.

If we obey the dictate we will be maintaining this office and our means of livelihood only by his sufferance. If we defy it we shall be constantly in a state of trepidant vigilance, and one or both of us will probably get killed. Well?"

I shook my head. "It couldn't be made plainer. I don't care much for either one." "Neither do I."
"If you got killed I'd be out of a job, and if I got killed you might as well retire." I glanced at my wristwatch. "The hell of it is we haven't got a week to decide. It's twelve-twenty, and I'm expected at the Hillside Kennels at three o'clock, and I have to eat lunch and shave and change my clothes. That is, if I go. If I go?"
==> "Precisely." Wolfe sighed. "That's the point. Two years ago, in the Orchard case, I took to myself the responsibility of ignoring this man's threat. Last year, in the Kane case, I did the same. This time I don't want to and I won't. Basic policy is my affair, I know that, but I am not going to tell you that in order to earn your pay you must go up there today and look at Mr. Rackham. If you prefer, you may phone and postpone it, and we'll consider the matter at greater length." <==
I had my brows raised at him. "I'll be damned. Put it on me, huh?"
'Yes, My nerve is gone. If public servants and other respected citizens take orders from this man, why shouldn't I?"
"You damn faker," I said indulgently. "You know perfectly well that I would

 rather eat soap than have you think I would knuckle under to that son of a bitch, and I know that you would rather put horseradish on oysters than have me think you would. I might if you didn't know about it, and you might if I didn't know about it, but as it is we're stuck."

==> Wolfe sighed again, deeper. "I take it that you're going?" <==
"I am. But under one condition, that the trepidant vigilance begins as of now. That you call Fritz in, and Theodore down from the plant rooms, and tell them what we're up against, and the chain bolts are to be kept constantly on both doors, and you keep away from windows, and nothing and no one is to be allowed to enter when I'm not here."
"Good heavens," he objected sourly, "that's no way to live."
"You can't tell till you try it. In ten years you may like it fine." I buzzed the plant rooms on the house phone to get Theodore.
Wolfe sat scowling at me.

WHEN, swinging the car off Taconic State Parkway to hit Route 100, my dash clock said only 2:40, I decided to make a little detour. It would be only a couple of miles out of my way. So at Pines Bridge I turned right, instead of left across the bridge. It wouldn't serve my purpose to make for the entrance to the estate where EASTCREST was carved on the great stone pillar, since all I would see there was a driveway curving up through the woods, and I turned off a mile short of that to climb a bumpy road up a hill. At the top the road went straight for a stretch between meadows, and I eased the car off onto the grass, stopped, and took the binoculars and aimed them at the summit of the next hill, somewhat higher than the one I was on, where the roof and upper walls of a stone mansion showed above the trees. Now, in early April, with no leaves yet, and with the binoculars, I could see most of the mansion and even something of the surrounding grounds, and a couple of men moving about.
That was Eastcrest, the legal residence of the illegal Arnold Zeck - but of course there are many ways of being illegal. One is to drive through a red light.

 Another is to break laws by proxy only, for money only, get your cut so it can't be traced, and never try to buy a man too cheap. That was what Zeck had been doing for more than twenty years - and there was Eastcrest.

==> All I was after was to take a look, just case it from a hilltop. I had never seen Zeck, and as far as I knew Wolfe hadn't either. Now that we were headed at him for the third time, and this time it might be for keeps, I thought I should at least see his roof and count his chimneys. That was all. He had been too damn remote and mysterious. Now I knew he had four chimneys, and that the one on the south wing had two loose bricks. <==
I turned the car around and headed down the hill, and, if you care to believe it, I kept glancing in the mirror to see if something showed up behind. That was how far gone I was on Zeck. It was not healthy for my self-respect, it was bad for my nerves, and I was good and tired of it.
Mrs. Rackham's place, Birchvale, was only five miles from there, the other side of Mount Kisco, but I made a wrong turn and didn't arrive until a quarter past three. The entrance to her estate was adequate but not imposing. I went on by, and before I knew it there was a neat little sign on the left:
HILLSIDE KENNELS
Doberman Pinschers
The gate opening was narrow and so was the drive, and I kept going on past the house to a bare rectangle in the rear, not very well graveled, and maneuvered into a corner close to a wooden building. As I climbed out a voice came from somewhere, and then a ferocious wild beast leaped from behind a hush and started for me like a streak of lightning. I froze except for my right arm, which sent my hand to my shoulder holster automatically.

I grinned at her. "Showing off. Okay? Want to try it? Get him and send him out from behind that same bush, with orders to take me, and any amount up to two bits, even, that he won't reach me." I returned the gun to the holster. "Ready?"
She blinked. "You mean you would?"
Hammond giggled. He was a full-sized middle-aged man and he looked like a banker, and I want to be fair to him, but he giggled. "Look out, Annabel," he said warningly. "He might."
"Of course," I told her, "you would be in the line of fire, and I've never shot a fast-moving dog, so we would both be taking a risk. Only I don't like you being skeptical. Stick around and you'll see."
That was a mistake, caused by my temperament. It is natural and wholesome for a man of my age to enjoy association with a woman of her age, maid, wife, or widow, but I should have had sense enough to stop to realize what I was getting in for. She had said that she had come to watch me work, and there I was asking for it. As a result, I had to spend a solid hour pretending that I was hell bent to find out who had poisoned one of Leeds' dogs when I didn't care a hang. Not that I love dog-poisoners, but that wasn't what was on my mind.
==> When Calvin Leeds showed up, as he did soon in an old station wagon with its rear taken up with a big wire cage, the four of us made a tour of the kennels and the runs, with Leeds briefing me, and me asking questions and making notes, and then we went in the house and extended the inquiry to aspects such as the poison used, the method employed, the known suspects, and so on. It was a strain. I had to make it good, because that was what I was supposed to be there for, and also because Annabel was too good-looking to let her be skeptical about me. And the dog hadn't even died! He was alive and well. But I went to it as if it were the biggest case of the year for Nero Wolfe and me, and Leeds got a good fifty bucks' worth of detection for nothing. Of course nobody got detected, but I asked damn good questions. <==
After Annabel and Hammond left to return to Birchvale next door, I asked Leeds about Hammond, and sure enough he was a banker. He was a vice- president of the Metropolitan Trust Company, who handled affairs for Mrs. Rackham - had done so ever since the death of her first husband. When I remarked that Hammond seemed to have it in mind to handle Mrs. Rackham's daughter-in-law also, Leeds said he hadn't noticed. I asked who else would be there at dinner.
"You and me," Leeds said. He was sipping a highball, taking his time with it. We were in the little living room of his little house, about which there was

 nothing remarkable except the dozens of pictures of dogs on the walls. Moving around outside, there had been more spring to him than to lots of guys half his age; now he was sprawled on a couch, all loose. I was reminded of one of the dogs we had come upon during our tour, lying in the sun at the door of its kennel.
"You and me," he said, "and my cousin and her husband, and Mrs. Frey, whom you have met, and Hammond, and the statesman, that's seven - "

out there, or a woman?"
"A woman," I said firmly. "I haven't run across her yet, there are so many,
but even if she does turn out to be a dog I hope to God it won't be one of yours. I want the kind I can let run loose." I waved a hand. "Forget it. You like 'em, you can have 'em. Mrs. Frey is a member of the household, is she?"
"Yes," he said shortly.
"Mrs. Rackham keeping her around as a souvenir of her dead son? Being neurotic about it?"
==> "I don't know. Ask her." Leeds straightened up and got to his feet. "You know, of course, that I didn't approve of her going to Nero Wolfe. I went with her only because she insisted on it. I don't see how any good can come of it, but I think harm might. I don't think you ought to be here, but you are, and we might as well go on over and drink their liquor instead of mine. I'll go and wash up." <==

 He left me.
IV
HAVING been given by Leeds my choice of driving over - three minutes - or taking a trail through the woods, I voted for walking. The edge of the woods was only a hundred yards to the rear of the kennels. It had been a warm day for early April, but now, with the sun gone over the hill, the sharp air made me want to step it up, which was just as well because I had to, to keep up with Leeds. He walked as if he meant it. When I commented on the fact that we ran into no fence anywhere, neither in the woods nor in the clear, he said that his place was merely a little corner of Mrs. Rackham's property which she had let him build on some years ago.
The last stretch of our walk was along a curving gravel path that wound through lawns, shrubs, trees, and different - shaped patches of bare earth.

Pierce was a smooth article. His manner was of course based on the law of nature regulating the attitude of an elected person toward everybody old enough to vote, but his timing and variations were so good that it was hard to recognize it, although he was only about my age. He was also about my size, with broad shoulders and a homely honest face, and a draw on his smile as swift as a flash bulb. I made a note to look up whether I lived in his assembly district. If he got the breaks the only question about him was how far and how soon.


If in addition to his own equipment and talents he acquired Lina Darrow
as a partner, it would probably be farther and sooner. She was, I would have guessed, slightly younger than Annabel Frey - twenty-six maybe - and I never saw a finer pair of eyes. She was obviously underplaying them, or rather what was back of them. When I was questioning her she pretended I had her in a corner, while her eyes gave it away that she could have waltzed all around me if she wanted to. I didn't know whether she thought she was kidding somebody, or was just practicing, or had some serious reason for passing herself off as a fib.
==> Barry Rackham had me stumped and also annoyed. Either I was dumber than Nero Wolfe thought I was, and twice as dumb as I thought I was, or he was smarter than he looked. New York was full of him, and he was full of New York. Go into any Madison Avenue bar between five and six-thirty and there would be six or eight of him there: not quite young but miles from being old; masculine all over except the fingernails; some tired and some fresh and ready, depending on the current status; and all slightly puffy below the eyes. I knew him from A to Z, or thought I did, but I couldn't make up my mind whether he knew what I was there for, and that was the one concrete thing I had hoped to get done. If he knew, the question whether he was on Zeck's payroll was answered; if he didn't, that question was still open. <==
And I still hadn't been able to decide when, at the dinner table, we had finished the dessert and got up to go elsewhere for coffee. At first I had thought he couldn't possibly be wise, when I had him sized up for a dummy who had had the good luck to catch Mrs. Rackham's eye somewhere and then had happened to take the only line she would fall for, but further observation had made me reconsider. His handling of his wife had character in it; it wasn't just yes or no. At the dinner table he had an exchange with Pierce about rent control, and without seeming to try he got the statesman so tangled up he couldn't wiggle loose. Then he had a good laugh, took the other side of the argument, and made a monkey out of Dana Hammond.
I decided I'd better start all over.
On the way back to the living room for coffee, Lina Darrow joined me. "Why did you take it out on me?" she demanded.
I said I didn't know I had.
"Certainly you did. Trying to indict me for dog poisoning. You went after

"Think you'll get anywhere on your job for Leeds?" he asked, jiggling his highball glass to make the ice tinkle.
I lifted my shoulders and let them drop. "I don't know. A month's gone by."
He nodded. "That's what makes it hard to believe." "Yeah, why?"


==> "That he would wait a month and then decide to blow himself to a fee for Nero Wolfe. Everybody knows that Wolfe comes high. I wouldn't have thought Leeds could afford it." Rackham smiled at me. "Driving back tonight?" <==
"No, I'm staying over."
"That's sensible. Night driving is dangerous, I think. The Sunday traffic won't be bad this time of year if you leave early." He touched my chest with a forefinger. "That's it, leave early." He moved off.
Annabel was yawning, and Dana Hammond was looking at her as if that was exactly what he had come to Birchvale for, to see her yawn. Lina Darrow was looking from Barry Rackham to me and back again, and pretending she wasn't looking anywhere with those eyes. The Doberman pinscher was standing tense, and Pierce, from a safe ten feet - one more than springing distance - was regarding it with an expression that gave me a more sympathetic feeling for him than I ever expected to have for a statesman.
Calvin Leeds and Mrs. Rackham were also looking at the dog, with a quite different expression.
"At least two pounds overweight," Leeds was saying. "You feed him too much."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 346    window = 341 351

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34363    window = 34358 34368


I said fast, "Take it easy." I got his arm again, and he was trembling. "You bust in there and there's no telling what you'll do. Stay here and I'll go - -
He pulled free and started off.
"Wait!" I commanded, and he halted. "But first get a doctor and call the police. Do that first. I'm going to your place. We left that knife in the dog, and someone might want it. Can't you put Hebe on guard here?"
He spoke, not to me but to Hebe. She came to him, a darting shadow, close to him. He leaned over to touch the shoulder of the body of Mrs. Barry Rackham and said, "Watch it, Hebe." The dog moved alongside the body, and Leeds, with nothing to say to me, went. He didn't leap or run, but he sure was gone. I called after him, "Phone the police before you kill anybody!" stepped to the trail, and headed for Hillside Kennels.
With the flashlight I had no trouble finding my way. This time, as I approached, the livestock barked plenty, and, hoping the kennel doors were all closed tight, I had my gun out as I passed the runs and the buildings. Nothing attacked me but noise, and that stopped when I had entered the house and dosed the door. Apparently if an enemy once got inside it was then up to the master.
==> Nobby was still there on the bench, and the knife was still in him. With only a glance at him in passing, I made for the little living room, where I had previously seen a phone on a table, fumed on a light, went to the phone, and got the operator and gave her a number. As I waited a look at my wristwatch showed me five minutes past midnight. I hoped Wolfe hadn't forgotten to plug in the line to his room when he went up to bed. He hadn't. After the ring signal had come five times I had his voice. <==
"Nero Wolfe speaking."
"Archie. Sorry to wake you up, but I need orders. We're minus a client. Mrs. Rackham. This is a quick guess, but it looks as if someone stabbed her with a knife and then stuck the knife in a dog. Anyhow, she's dead. I've just - "
"What is this?" It was almost a bellow. "Flummery?"
"No, sir. I've just come from where she's lying in the woods. Leeds and I found her. The dog's dead too, here on a bench. I don't - "
"Archie!"

He pulled free and started off.
"Wait!" I commanded, and he halted. "But first get a doctor and call the police. Do that first. I'm going to your place. We left that knife in the dog, and someone might want it. Can't you put Hebe on guard here?"
He spoke, not to me but to Hebe. She came to him, a darting shadow, close to him. He leaned over to touch the shoulder of the body of Mrs. Barry Rackham and said, "Watch it, Hebe." The dog moved alongside the body, and Leeds, with nothing to say to me, went. He didn't leap or run, but he sure was gone. I called after him, "Phone the police before you kill anybody!" stepped to the trail, and headed for Hillside Kennels.
With the flashlight I had no trouble finding my way. This time, as I approached, the livestock barked plenty, and, hoping the kennel doors were all closed tight, I had my gun out as I passed the runs and the buildings. Nothing attacked me but noise, and that stopped when I had entered the house and dosed the door. Apparently if an enemy once got inside it was then up to the master.
Nobby was still there on the bench, and the knife was still in him. With only a glance at him in passing, I made for the little living room, where I had previously seen a phone on a table, fumed on a light, went to the phone, and got the operator and gave her a number. As I waited a look at my wristwatch showed me five minutes past midnight. I hoped Wolfe hadn't forgotten to plug in the line to his room when he went up to bed. He hadn't. After the ring signal had come five times I had his voice.

A grunt and a pause. "On what I know now, everything about Mrs. Rackham's talk with me and the purpose of your trip there. About Mrs. Rackham and Mr. Leeds and what you have seen and heard there, everything. But you will of course confine yourself strictly to that."
"Nothing about sausage?"
"Absolutely nothing. The question is idiotic."
"Yeah, I just asked. Okay. Well, I got here and met dogs and people.
Leeds' place is on a corner of Mrs. Rackham's property, and we walked through the woods for dinner at Birchvale. There were eight of us at dinner...."
==> I'm fairly good with a billiard cue, and only Saul Panzer can beat me at tailing a man or woman in New York, but what I am best at is reporting a complicated event to Nero Wolfe. With, I figured, a probable maximum of ten minutes for it, I covered all the essentials in eight, leaving him two for questions. He had some, of course. But I think he had the picture well enough to sleep on when I saw the light of a car through the window, told him good-by, and hung up. I stepped from the living room into the little hall, opened the outside door, and was standing on the stone slab as a car with STATE POLICE painted on it came down the narrow drive and stopped. Two uniformed public servants piled out and made for me. I only hoped neither of them was my pet Westchester hate, Lieutenant Con Noonan, and had my hope granted. They were both rank-and- file. <==
One of them spoke. "Your name Goodwin?"
I conceded it. Dogs had started to bark.
"After finding a dead body you went off and came here to rest your feet?" "I didn't find the body. A dog did. As for my feet, do you mind stepping
inside?"
I held the door open, and they crossed the threshold. With a thumb I called

"You ran? Why?"
"To keep up with him."
Noonan smiled. He has the meanest smile I know of except maybe Boris
Karloff. "You get your comedy from the comics, don't you, Goodwin?" "Yes, sir."
"Tell me about the dinner here and afterwards. Make it as funny as you can.
==> I took ten minutes for it, as much as I had had for Wolfe, but getting interrupted with questions. I stuck to facts and gave them to him straight. When we came to the end he went back and concentrated on whether all of them had heard Mrs. Rackham say she was going for a walk with the dog, as of course they had since she had issued a blanket invitation for company. Then I was sent back to the living room, and it was Lina Darrow's turn in the preliminaries. I wondered if she would play dumb with him as she had with me. <==
It was as empty a stretch or hours as I have ever spent. I might as well have been a housebroken dog; no one seemed to think I mattered, and I was not in a position to tell them how wrong they were. At one point I made a serious effort to get into a conversation, making the rounds and offering remarks, but got nowhere. Dana Hammond merely gave me a look, without opening his trap. Oliver Pierce didn't even look at me. Lina Darrow mumbled something and turned away. Calvin Leeds asked me what they had done with Nobby's remains, nodded and frowned at my answer, and went to put another log on the fire. Annabel Frey asked me if I wanted more coffee, and when I said yes apparently didn't hear me. Barry Rackham, whom I tackled at the far end of the room, was the most talkative. He wanted to know whether anyone had come from the District Attorney's office. I said I didn't know. He wanted to know the name of

 the cop in the other room who was asking questions, and I told him Lieutenant Con Noonan. That was my longest conversation, two whole questions and answers.
I did get in one piece of detection, somewhat later, when finally District Attorney Cleveland Archer made an appearance. As he came into the room and made himself known and everybody moved to approach him, I took a look at his shoes and saw that he had undoubtedly been in the woods to inspect the spot where Mrs. Rackham's body was found. Likewise Ben Dykes, the dean of the Westchester County dicks, who was with him. That made me feel slightly better. It would have been a shame to stick there the whole night without detecting a single damn thing.
After a few preliminary words to individuals Archer spoke to them collectively. "This is a terrible thing, an awful thing. It is established that Mrs. Rackham was stabbed to death out there in the woods - and the dog that was with her. We have the knife that was used, as you know - it has been shown to you - one of the steak knives that are kept in a drawer here in the dining room - they were used by you at dinner last evening. We have statements from all of you, but of course I'll have to talk further with you. I won't try to do that now. It's after three o'clock, and I'll come back in the morning. I want to ask whether any of you has anything to say to me now, anything that shouldn't wait until then." His eyes went over them. "Anyone?"

Archer, slightly plumper than he had been a year ago, with his round red

 face saggy and careworn by the stress of an extremely bad night for him, put his forearms on the table and leaned at me.
"Goodwin," he said earnestly but not offensively, "I want to put something up to you."
"Suits me, Mr. Archer," I assured him. "I've never been ignored more."
==> "We've been busy. Lieutenant Noonan has of course reported what you told him. Frankly, I find it hard to believe. Almost impossible to believe. It is well known that Nero Wolfe refuses dozens of jobs every month, that he confines himself to cases that interest him, and that the easiest and quickest way to interest him is to offer him a large fee. Now I - " <==
"Not the only way," I objected.
"I didn't say it was. I know he has standards - even scruples. Now I can't believe that he found anything interesting in the poisoning of a dog - certainly not interesting enough for him to send you up here over a weekend. And I doubt very much if Calvin Leeds, from what I know of him, is in a position to offer Wolfe a fee that would attract him. His cousin, Mrs. Rackham, might have, but she did not have the reputation of throwing money around carelessly - rather the contrary. We're going to ask Wolfe about this, naturally, but I thought I might save time by putting it up to you. I appeal to you to cooperate with us in solving this dastardly and cowardly murder. As you know, I have a right to insist on it; knowing you and Wolfe as I do, I prefer to appeal to you as to a responsible citizen and a man who carries a license to work in this state as a private detective. I simply do not believe that you were sent up here merely to investigate the poisoning of a dog."
They were all glaring at me.
"I wasn't," I said mildly.
"Ha, you weren't!"

You asked if I was investigating the dog poisoning, and I told you I spent an hour at it, which I did. You asked if I had made any progress, and I told you nothing remarkable.

Noonan blurted, 'Why, you goddam - "
"I'll handle it," Archer snapped at him. Back to me: "You might have supplied it, Goodwin."

"Not to him," I said firmly, "I tried supplying him once and he was
displeased. Anyway, I doubt if he would have understood it."
"See if I can understand it."
"Yes, sir. Mrs. Rackham phoned Thursday afternoon and made an
==> appointment to see Mr. Wolfe. She came yesterday morning - Friday - at eleven o'clock, and had Leeds with her. She said that it had been her custom, since marrying Rackham three years and seven months ago, to give him money for his personal use when he asked for it, but that he kept asking for bigger amounts, and she began giving him less than he asked for, and last October second he wanted fifteen grand, and she refused. Gave him zero. Since then, the past seven months, he had asked for none and got none, but in spite of that he had gone on spending plenty, and that was what was biting her. She hired Mr. Wolfe to find out where and how he was getting dough, and I was sent up here to look him over and possibly get hold of an idea. I needed an excuse for coming here, and the dog poisoning was better than average." I fluttered a hand. "That's all." <==
"You say Leeds was with her?" Noonan demanded.
"That's partly what I mean," I told Ben Dykes, "about Noonan's notion of how to ask questions. He must have heard me say she had Leeds along."
"Yeah," Dykes said dryly. "But don't be so damn cute. This is not exactly a picnic." He spoke to Noonan. "Leeds didn't make any mention of this?"
"He did not. Of course I didn't ask him."
Dykes stood up and asked Archer, "Hadn't I better send for him? He went home."

"That's all she asked for."
"Had she quarreled with her husband? Had he threatened her?"
"She didn't say so."
"Exactly what did she say?"
That took half an hour. For me it was simple, since all I had to use was my
==> memory, in view of the instructions from Wolfe to give them everything but the sausage. Archer didn't know what my memory is capable of, so I didn't repeat any of Mrs. Rackham's speeches verbatim, though I could have, because he would have thought I was dressing it up. But when I was through he had it all. <==
Then I was permitted to stay for the session with Leeds, who had arrived early in my recital but had been held outside until I was done. At last I was one of the party, but too late to hear anything that I didn't already know. With Leeds,

 who was practically one of the family, they had to cover not only his visit with his cousin to Wolfe's office, but also the preliminaries to it, so he took another half-hour and more. He himself had no idea, he said, where Rackham had been getting money. He had learned nothing from the personal inquiry he had undertaken at his cousin's request. He had never heard, or heard of, any serious quarrel between his cousin and her husband. And so on. As for his failure to tell Noonan of the visit to Wolfe's office and the real reason for my presence at Birchvale, he merely said calmly that Noonan hadn't asked and he preferred to wait until he was asked.
District Attorney Archer finally called it a night, got up and stretched, rubbed his eyes with his fingertips, asked Dykes and Noonan some questions and issued some orders, and addressed me. "You're staying at Leeds' place?"
I said I hadn't stayed there much so far, but my bag was there.

lift, but we declined.

 reached the scientist at the tar end of the forbidden section, who not only challenged us but had to be persuaded that we weren't a pair of blood - thirsty liars. Finally he was bighearted enough to let us go on.
I was glad they had taken Nobby away, not caring much for another view or the little hall with that canine corpse on the bench. Otherwise the house was as before. Leeds had stopped at the kennels. I went up to my room and was peeling off the pants I had pulled on over my pajamas when I was startled by a sudden dazzling blaze at the window. I crossed to it and stuck my head out: it was the sun showing off, trying to scare somebody.
I glanced at my wrist and saw 5:39, but as I said, maybe it wasn't a true horizon. Not lowering the window shade, I went and stretched out on the bed and yawned as far down as it could go.
The door downstairs opened and shut, and there were steps on the stairs. Leeds appeared at my open door, stepped inside, and said, "I'll have to be up and around in an hour, so I'll close your door."
I thanked him. He didn't move.
==> "My cousin paid Mr. Wolfe ten thousand dollars. What will he do now?" "I don't know, I haven't asked him. Why?" <==
"It occurred to me that he might want to spend it, or part of it, in her
interest. In case the police don't make any headway."
"He might," I agreed. "I'll suggest it to him."
He still stood, as if there was something else on his mind. There was, and
he unloaded it.

He still stood, as if there was something else on his mind. There was, and
he unloaded it.
"It happens in the best families," he stated distinctly and backed out,
taking the door with him.
I closed my eyes but made no effort to empty my head. If I went to sleep
==> there was no telling when I would wake up, and I intended to phone Wolfe at eight, fifteen minutes before the scheduled hour for Fritz to get to his room with his breakfast tray. Meanwhile I would think of something brilliant to do or to suggest. The trouble with that, I discovered after some poking around, was that I had no in. Nobody would speak to me except Leeds, and he was far from loquacious. <==
I have a way of realizing all of a sudden, as I suppose a lot of people do, that I made a decision some time back without knowing it. It happened that morning at 6:25. Looking at my watch and seeing that that was where it had got to, I was suddenly aware that I was staying awake, not so I could phone Wolfe at eight o'clock, but so I could beat it the hell out of there as soon as I was sure Leeds was asleep; and I was now as sure as I would ever be.
I got up and shed my pajamas and dressed, not trying to set a record but

 wasting no time, and, with my bag in one hand and my shoes in the other, tiptoed to the hall, down the stairs, and out to the stone slab. While it wasn't Calvin Leeds I was escaping from, I thought it desirable to get out of Westchester County before anyone knew I wasn't upstairs asleep. Not a chance.
I was seated on the stone slab tying the lace of the second shoe when a dog barked, and that was a signal for all the others. I scrambled up, grabbed the bag, ran to the car and unlocked it and climbed in, started the engine, swung around the graveled space, and passed the house on my way out just as Leeds emerged through the side door. I stepped on the brake, stuck my head through the window, yelled at him, "Got an errand to do, see you later!" and rolled on through the gate and into the highway.

At that hour Sunday morning the roads were all mine, the bright new sun was at my left out of the way, and it would have been a pleasant drive if I had been in a mood to feel pleased. Which I wasn't. This was a totally different situation from the other two occasions when we had crossed Arnold Zeck's path and someone had got killed. Then the corpses had been Zeck's men, and Zeck, Wolfe, and the public interest had all been on the same side. This time Zeck's man, Barry Rackham, was the number one suspect, and Wolfe had either to return his dead client's ten grand, keep it without doing anything to earn it, or meet Zeck head on. Knowing Wolfe as I did, I hit eighty-five that morning rolling south on the Sawmill River Parkway.

The dash clock said 7:18 as I left the West Side Highway at 46th Street.
I had to cross to Ninth Avenue to turn south. It was as empty as the country roads had been. Turning right on 35th, I went on across Tenth Avenue, on nearly to Eleventh, and pulled to the curb in front of Wolfe's old brown-stone house. Even before I killed the engine I saw something that made me goggle - a sight that had never greeted me before in the thousands of rimes I had braked a car to a stop there.
The front door was standing wide open.
VI
MY HEART came up. I swallowed it down, jumped out, ran across the sidewalk and up the seven steps to the stoop and on in. Fritz and Theodore were there in the hall, coming to me. Their faces were enough to make a guy's heart pop right out of his mouth.

I stepped on the brake, stuck my head through the window, yelled at him, "Got an errand to do, see you later!" and rolled on through the gate and into the highway.
At that hour Sunday morning the roads were all mine, the bright new sun was at my left out of the way, and it would have been a pleasant drive if I had been in a mood to feel pleased. Which I wasn't. This was a totally different situation from the other two occasions when we had crossed Arnold Zeck's path and someone had got killed. Then the corpses had been Zeck's men, and Zeck, Wolfe, and the public interest had all been on the same side. This time Zeck's man, Barry Rackham, was the number one suspect, and Wolfe had either to return his dead client's ten grand, keep it without doing anything to earn it, or meet Zeck head on. Knowing Wolfe as I did, I hit eighty-five that morning rolling south on the Sawmill River Parkway.
The dash clock said 7:18 as I left the West Side Highway at 46th Street.
==> I had to cross to Ninth Avenue to turn south. It was as empty as the country roads had been. Turning right on 35th, I went on across Tenth Avenue, on nearly to Eleventh, and pulled to the curb in front of Wolfe's old brown-stone house. Even before I killed the engine I saw something that made me goggle - a sight that had never greeted me before in the thousands of rimes I had braked a car to a stop there. <==
The front door was standing wide open.

MY HEART came up. I swallowed it down, jumped out, ran across the sidewalk and up the seven steps to the stoop and on in. Fritz and Theodore were there in the hall, coming to me. Their faces were enough to make a guy's heart pop right out of his mouth.
"Airing the house?" I demanded.

"He's gone," Fritz said.
"Gone where?"
"I don't know. During the night. When I saw the door was open - " "What's that in your hand?"
"He left them on the table in his room - for Theodore and me, and one for you - "
==> I snatched the pieces of paper from his trembling hand and looked at the one on top. The writing on it was Wolfe's. <==
Dear Fritz;
Marko Vukcic will want your services. He should pay you at least $2000 a month.
My best regards....

I went through them again, watching each word, told Fritz and Theodore, "Come and sit down," went to the office, and sat at my desk. They moved chairs to face me, "He's gone," Fritz said, trying to convince himself.
"So it seems," I said aggressively.
"You know where he is," Theodore told me accusingly. "It won't be easy to move some of the plants without damage. I don't like working on Long Island, not for two hundred dollars a week. When is he coming back?"
==> "Look, Theodore," I said, "I don't give a good goddam what you like or don't like. Mr. Wolfe has always pampered you because you're the best orchid nurse alive. This is as good a time as any to tell you that you remind me of sour <==

 milk. I do not know where Mr. Wolfe is nor if or when he's coming back. To you he sent his regards. To me he sent his very best regards and wishes. Now shut up."
I shifted to Fritz. "He thinks Marko Vukcic should pay you twice as much as he does. That's like him, huh? You can see I'm sore as hell, his doing it like this, but I'm not surprised. To show you how well I know him, this is what happened: not long after I phoned him last night he simply wrote these notes to us and walked out of the house, leaving the door open - you said you found it open - to show anyone who might be curious that there was no longer anyone or anything of any importance inside. You got up at your usual time, six-thirty, saw the open door, went up to his room, found his bed empty and the notes on the table. After going up to the plant rooms to call Theodore, you returned to his room, looked around, and discovered that he had taken nothing with him. Then you and Theodore stared at each other until I arrived. Have you anything to add to that?"
"I don't want to work on Long Island," Theodore stated.
Fritz only said, "Find him, Archie."

"Yes - but find him! Where will he sleep? What will he eat?"

"Good. I'll finish off with that on a couple of hot cakes. Then we'll see how I feel."
"I would never have thought - " Fritz's voice had a quaver, and he stopped and started over again. "I would never have thought this could happen. What is it, Archie?" He was practically wailing. "What is it? His appetite has been good."
"We were going to repot some Miltonias today," Theodore said dismally.
I snorted. "Go ahead and pot 'em. He was no help anyhow. Beat it and let me alone. I've got to think. Also I'm hungry. Beat it!"
Theodore, mumbling, shuffled out. Fritz, following him, turned at the door. "That's it, Archie. Think. Think where he is while I get your breakfast."
==> He left me, and I sat down at my desk to do the thinking, but the cogs wouldn't catch. I was too mad to think. "Don't look for me." That was him to a T. He knew damn well that if I should ever come home to find he had vanished, the one activity that would make any sense at all would be to start looking for him, and here I was stopped cold at the take-off. Not that I had no notion at all. That was why I had left Leeds' place without notice and stepped it up to eighty-five getting back: I did have a notion. Two years had passed since Wolfe had told me, "Archie, you are to forget that you know that man's name. If ever, in the course of my business, I find that I am committed against him and must destroy him, I shall leave this house, find a place where I can work - and sleep and eat if there is time for it - and stay there until I have finished." <==
So that part was okay, but what about me? On another occasion, a year later, he had said to five members of a family named Sperling, in my presence, "In that event he will know it is a mortal encounter, and so will I, and I shall move to a base of operations which will be known only to Mr. Goodwin and perhaps two others." Okay. There was no argument with the mortal encounter or about the move. But I was the Mr. Goodwin referred to, and here I was staring at it - "Don't look for me." Where did that leave me? Certainly the two others he had had in mind were Saul Panzer and Marko Vukcic, and I didn't even dare to phone Saul and ask a couple of discreet questions; and besides, if he had let Saul in and left me out, to hell with him. And what was I supposed to say to people - for instance, people like the District Attorney of Westchester County?
That particular question got answered, partly at least, from an unexpected

 quarter. When I had finished with the griddle cakes, ham, eggs, thyme honey, and coffee, I went back to the office to see if I was ready to quit feeling and settle down to thinking, and was working at it when I became aware that I was sitting in Wolfe's chair behind his desk. That brought me up with a jerk. No one else, including me, ever sat in that chair, but there I was. I didn't approve of it. It seemed to imply that Wolfe was through with that chair for good, and that was a hell of an attitude to take, no matter how sore I was. I opened a drawer of his desk to check its contents, pretending that was what I had sat there for, and was starting a careful survey when the doorbell rang.
Going to answer it, I took my time because I had done no thinking yet and therefore didn't know my lines. Seeing through the one-way glass panel in the front door that the man on the stoop was a civilian stranger, my first impulse was to let him ring until he got tired, but curiosity chased it away and I opened the door. He was just a citizen with big ears and an old topcoat, and he asked to see Mr. Nero Wolfe. I told him Mr. Wolfe wasn't available on Sundays, and I was his confidential assistant, and could I help.

Another thing - apparently I still had my job, unlike Fritz and Theodore. But I couldn't sign checks, I couldn't - suddenly I remembered something. The fact that I hadn't thought of it before indicates the state I was in. I have told, in my account of another case of Wolfe's how, in anticipation of the possibility that some day a collision with Arnold Zeck would drive him into a foxhole, he had instructed me to put fifty thousand dollars in cash in a safe deposit box over in Jersey, and how I obeyed instructions. The idea was to have a source of supply for the foxhole; but anyway, there it was, fifty grand, in the box rented by me under the name I had selected for the purpose. I was sitting thinking how upset I must have been not to have thought of that before when the phone rang and I reached for it.

"Nero Wolfe's office, Archie Goodwin speaking."
I thought it proper to use that, the familiar routine, since according to Wolfe's ad he wouldn't retire until the next day.
"Archie?" A voice I knew sounded surprised. "Is that you, Archie?" "Right. Hello, Marko. So early on Sunday?"

I eyed him. "You know damn well," I said, "that when Mr. Wolfe was here you would never have dreamed of asking who was that, either of him or of me. Don't dream of it now, anyway not when I'm in the humor I'm in at present."
"I only wanted - "
"Skip it. I advise you to steer clear of me until I've had a chance to think." I went to the office and this time took my own chair. At least I had got
some instructions from Wolfe, though his method of sending them was certainly

I was to handle inquiries from clients on unfinished matters, but only from clients; and since Mrs. Rackham, being dead, couldn't inquire, that settled that. Another thing - apparently I still had my job, unlike Fritz and Theodore. But I couldn't sign checks, I couldn't - suddenly I remembered something. The fact that I hadn't thought of it before indicates the state I was in. I have told, in my account of another case of Wolfe's how, in anticipation of the possibility that some day a collision with Arnold Zeck would drive him into a foxhole, he had instructed me to put fifty thousand dollars in cash in a safe deposit box over in Jersey, and how I obeyed instructions. The idea was to have a source of supply for the foxhole; but anyway, there it was, fifty grand, in the box rented by me under the name I had selected for the purpose. I was sitting thinking how upset I must have been not to have thought of that before when the phone rang and I reached for it. <==

I said I could. There was no need to ask where, since the only place he could ever be found was the restaurant premises, either on one of the two floors for the public, in the kitchen, or up in his private quarters.

But he wasn't. All he led me to was a chair by a window. He took another one, facing me, and sat with his palms on his knees, his head cocked a little to one side as usual.
"My friend Archie," he said sympathetically. "It is my part to tell you exactly certain things. But before I do that I wish to tell you a thing of my own. I wish to remind you that I have known Nero a much longer time than you have. We knew each other as boys in another country - much younger than you were that day many years ago when you first saw him and went to work for him. He is my old and dear friend, and I am his.

"I can remember them if you can. Shoot."
Marko nodded. "I know of your great memory. Nero has often spoken of
it." He shut his eyes and in a moment opened them again. "There are these five things. First, the plants. He telephoned Mr. Hewitt last night, and tomorrow Mr. Hewitt will arrange for the plants to be moved to his place, and also for Theodore to go there to work. Second - "
"Am I to list the plants? Do the records go too?"
"I don't know. I can say only what I was told to say. That's all about the plants. Perhaps Mr. Hewitt can tell you. Second, that is Fritz. He will work here, and I will pay him well. I will see him today and arrange the details. Of course he is unhappy?"
==> "He thinks Mr. Wolfe will starve to death." <==
"But naturally. If not that, something else. I have always thought it a folly for him to be a detective. Third - I am third. I have a power of attorney. Do you want to see it?"
"No, thanks, I'll take your word for it."
"It is in there locked up. Nero said it is legal, and he knows. I can sign checks for you. I can sign anything. I can do anything he could do."
"Within certain limits. You can't - " I waved a hand. "Forget it. Fourth?"
"Fourth is the house. I am to offer the house and its contents for sale. On that I have confidential instructions."

"Hell, he's gone batty, like lots of geniuses," I declared, and got up to go.
VII
I DROVE around for two solid hours, mostly in the park. Now and then, for a change of scene, I left the park for a patrol of the avenues.
I hadn't been able to start thinking in the house, and it might work better on the move. Moreover, I didn't want any more just then of Fritz or Theodore, or in fact of anybody but me. So, in the light of experience and guided by intelligence, I drove around. Somewhere along the way I saw clearly what my trouble was: I was completely out of errands for the first time in years. How could I decide what to do when I had nothing to do? I now believe that the

==> ason I never drove farther north than 40th Street, nor farther south than i4th Street during those two hours, was that I thought Wolfe was probably somewhere within those limits and I didn't want to leave them. <==
When I did leave them it wasn't voluntary. Rolling down Second Avenue in the Seventies, I had stopped for a red light abreast of a police car on my left. Just as the light was changing, the cop on my side stuck his head out and called, "Pull over to the curb."
Flattered at the attention as any motorist would be, not, I obeyed. The police car came alongside, and the cop got out and invented another new phrase. "Let me see your license."
I got it out and handed it to him, and he took a look.
"Yeah, I thought I recognized you." He handed the license back, walked around the front of my car to the other side, got in beside me, and suggested, "Let's go to the Nineteenth Precinct. Sixty-seventh east of Lexington."
"That's one idea," I admitted. "Or what's wrong with the Brooklyn Botanical Garden, especially on Easter? I'll toss you for it."

place, and I said my bag was there, and you said you would want me today, and I said of course. If I had stayed at Leeds' place I might have been permitted seven hours' sleep. I decided to do something else with seven hours, and they're not up yet. But you see fit to ring a bell on me. I'll do one of two things. I'll have a bite of lunch and then drive up there, unaccompanied, or I'll make it as hard as I possibly can for this man you sent to get me outside the city limits - whichever you prefer. Here he comes now."
"Here who comes?"
"Your man. Coming in the door. If you decide you want to see me today, tell him not to trail along behind me. It makes me self-conscious."
A silence. Then, "You were told not to leave the county."
"I was not. By no one."
==> "Neither you nor Wolfe was at home at eleven o'clock - or if you were you <==
wouldn't see my man."
"I was in the Easter parade,"
Another silence, longer. "What time will you be here? At Birchvale." "I can make it by two o'clock."
"My man is there?"
"Yes."

"Let me talk to him."
That was satisfactory. I liked that all right, except for one thing. After the
Westchester dick was finished on the phone and it was settled that I would roll my own, and the sergeant had generously said that the Police Department would contribute the phone call, I asked the dick if he understood that I didn't care to be
==> tailed, and he replied that I needn't worry because he was going back to 35th Street to see Nero Wolfe. I didn't care much for that, but said nothing because I hadn't yet decided exactly what to say. So when I found a place on Lexington Avenue for a sandwich and a malted, I went first to a phone booth, called the house, and told Fritz to leave the chain bolt on, tell callers that Wolfe was out of the city and no more, and admit no one. <==
Being on the move did help. Having decided, while touring the park and avenues, what my immediate trouble was, I now, on my way to Birchvale, got the whole thing into focus. Considering the entire picture, including the detail of putting the house up for sale and the lack of even one little hint for me, let alone a blueprint, it was by no means a bet that Wolfe had merely dived into a foxhole. Look how free Marko had been with his poor-young-friending. It was not inconceivable that Wolfe had decided to chuck it for good. A hundred times and more, when things or people - frequently me - didn't suit him, he had told me about the house he owned in Egypt and how pleasant it would be to live there. I had always brushed it off. I now realized that a man who is eccentric enough to threaten to go and live in Egypt is eccentric enough to do it, especially when it gets to the point where he opens a package of sausage and has to run for his life.
Therefore I would be a dimwit to assume that this was merely time out to gather ammunition and make plans. Nor could I assume that it wasn't. I couldn't assume anything. Was he gone for good, or was he putting on a charade that would make all his other performances look like piker stuff in comparison? Presumably I was to answer that question, along with others, by the light of experience guided by intelligence, and I did not appreciate the compliment. If I was finally and permanently on my own, very well; I would make out. But apparently I was still drawing pay, so what? The result of my getting the whole picture into focus was that as I turned in at the entrance to Birchvale I was sorer than ever.
I was stopped at the entrance by one of Noonan's colleagues, there on guard, and was allowed to proceed up the curving drive only after I had shown him four documents. Parking in a space at the side of the house that was bordered by evergreens, I walked around to the front door and was admitted by a maid who looked pale and puffy. She didn't say anything, just held the door open, but a man was there too, one of the county boys whom I knew by sight but

 not by name. He said, "This way," and led me to the right, to the same small room I had seen before.

Ben Dykes, sitting there at the table with a stack of papers, grunted at me, "So you finally got here."

"You dozed off forty minutes," Dykes declared. He was still at the table with the papers, and standing beside him was District Attorney Archer.
"That leaves me," I said, "still behind seven hours and more."
"We want a statement," Archer said impatiently.
"The sooner the better," I agreed, and pulled my chair up. Archer sat at the
end of the table at my left, Dykes across from me, and the skinny guy, with a notebook and pen, at the other end.
==> "First," Archer said, "repeat what you told us last night about Mrs. Rackham's visit to Wolfe's office with Leeds." <==
"But," I objected, "that'll take half an hour, and you're busy. That's routine.

 I assure you it won't vary."
"Go ahead. I want to hear it, and I have questions."
I yawned thoroughly, rubbed my eyes with the heels of my palms, and started. At first it was fuzzy, but it flowed easy after a minute or two, and it would have been a pleasure to have them compare it with a record from the previous recital if there had been one.

"Sure, glad to. If you'll pay the notary fee."
"Go and type it, Cheney."
The skinny guy got up, with his notebook, and left. After the door was
closed Archer spoke.
"You might as well know it, Goodwin; you've been contradicted. Mr.
==> Rackham says you're lying about his wife's conversation with Wolfe." "Yeah? How does he know? He wasn't there." <==
"He says that she couldn't possibly have said what you report because it
wasn't true. He says that there was no question or misunderstanding about money between them. He also says that she told him that she suspected her financial affairs were being mishandled by Mr. Hammond of the Metropolitan Trust Company, and that she was going to consult Nero Wolfe about it."
"Well." I yawned. "That's interesting. Leeds is on my side. Who's on his?" "No one so far."
"Have you tried it out on Leeds?"
"Yes. As you say, he's on your side. He has signed a statement. So has Mr.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34783    window = 34778 34788


"Yes. The will was read to the family today. I was present. There are a number of bequests to servants and distant relatives, Mrs. Frey gets this place and a million dollars. Leeds gets half a million. Lina Darrow gets two hundred thousand. The rest goes to Mr. Rackham."


"I see. Then he's a millionaire, so it's delicate. Even so, he's a damn liar
and it's two to one. I'll sign that statement in triplicate if you want it. Beyond that what can I say?"
==> "I want to make it three to one." Archer leaned to me. "Listen, Goodwin. I have great respect for Nero Wolfe's talents, I have reason to, as you know. But I do not intend to let his whims interfere with the functions of my office. I want a statement from him supporting yours and Leeds', and I mean to have it without delay. I sent a man to get it. This morning at eleven o'clock he was told that Wolfe wasn't available and that you weren't there and your whereabouts were not known. That was when an alarm was spread for you. I had a phone call from my man an hour ago. He had gone back to Wolfe's house and had been told that Wolfe was out of the city, and that was all he could get." <==
Archer made a hand into a fist, resting on the table. "I won't stand for it, Goodwin. This is the toughest one I've had in my county since I took office, and I won't stand for it. Whatever else he is, he's a fat conceited peacock and it's time somebody called him. There's a phone you can use. Two hours from now, unless he's here and talking to me, there'll be a warrant for his arrest as a material witness. There's the phone."
"I doubt if you could paste material witness on him. He hasn't been anywhere near here."
"Nuts," Ben Dykes growled. "Don't be a sap. She takes troubles to him Friday and gets murdered Saturday."
I decided to take the plunge. The way I felt, it would have been a pleasure to let them go ahead with a warrant, but if I tried to stall I would need a very fancy excuse tomorrow when they saw the ad in the Gazette. So I thought what the hell, now is as good a time as any, and told them.
"I can't phone him because I don't know where he is."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34798    window = 34793 34803




Finally Dykes turned his head to tell Archer, "This makes it nice." Archer nodded, not taking his regard from me. "It's hard to believe,
Goodwin."
"I'll say it is. For him to - "
==> "No, no. It's hard to believe that Wolfe and you would try anything as <==
fantastic as this. Obviously he was absolutely compelled to. You phoned him from Leeds' place last night, as soon as you could get to a phone after Mrs. Rackham was murdered. That was - "
"Excuse me," I said firmly. "Not as soon as I could get to a phone after Mrs. Rackham was murdered. As soon as I could get to a phone after I found out she had been murdered."
"Very well. We're not in court." He was leaning at me. "That was shortly after midnight. What did you say to him?"
"I told him what had happened. I reported, as fully as I could in the time I had, everything from my arrival here up to then. If the operator listened in you can check with her. I asked if I should limit my talk with the cops to events here and leave the rest for him to tell, and he said no, I should withhold nothing, including all details of Mrs. Rackham's talk with him. That was all. As you know, I followed instructions."
"Jesus," Dykes said. "Son, it looks like your turn to sweat has come."

fantastic as this. Obviously he was absolutely compelled to. You phoned him from Leeds' place last night, as soon as you could get to a phone after Mrs. Rackham was murdered. That was - "
"Excuse me," I said firmly. "Not as soon as I could get to a phone after Mrs. Rackham was murdered. As soon as I could get to a phone after I found out she had been murdered."
"Very well. We're not in court." He was leaning at me. "That was shortly after midnight. What did you say to him?"
"I told him what had happened. I reported, as fully as I could in the time I had, everything from my arrival here up to then. If the operator listened in you can check with her. I asked if I should limit my talk with the cops to events here and leave the rest for him to tell, and he said no, I should withhold nothing, including all details of Mrs. Rackham's talk with him. That was all. As you know, I followed instructions."
"Jesus," Dykes said. "Son, it looks like your turn to sweat has come."
==> Archer ignored him. "And after telling you to withhold nothing from the police, Wolfe suddenly decides, in the middle of the night, that he has had enough of detective work, sends an ad to a newspaper announcing his retirement, calls on a friend to arrange for the care of his orchids - and what did he do then? I was so engrossed I may have missed something." <==
"I don't know what he did. He walked out. He disappeared."
I was aware, of course, of how it sounded. It was completely cuckoo. It was all rayon and a yard wide. I damn near made it even worse by telling them about the sausage and the tear gas, of course without letting on that we knew who had sent it, but realized in time how that would go over in the circumstances. That would have made a hit. But I had to say or do something, and decided to produce evidence, so I reached to my pocket for it.
"He left notes on the table in his bedroom," I said, "for Fritz and Theodore and me. Here's mine."
I handed it to Archer. He read it and passed it to Dykes, Dykes read it twice and returned it to Archer, who stuck it in his pocket.
"Jesus," Dykes said again, looking at me in a way I didn't like. "This is really something. I've always thought Nero Wolfe had a lot on the ball, and you too in a way, but this is about the worst I ever saw. Really." He turned to Archer.

 "It's plain what happened."
"It certainly is." Archer made a fist. "Goodwin, I don't ask you to tell me. I'll tell you. When you found Mrs. Rackham there dead, you and Leeds agreed on a tale about the visit to Nero Wolfe. Leeds came here to break the news. You went to his place to phone Wolfe and report, both the murder and the tale you and Leeds had agreed on - or maybe Wolfe knew that already, since you had pretended to investigate the dog poisoning. In any case, Wolfe knew something that he didn't dare to try to cover and that, equally, he didn't dare to reveal. What made it unbearably hot was the murder. So he arranged to disappear, and we haven't got him, and it may take a day or a week to find him. But we've got you."
The fist hit the table, not hard. "You know where Wolfe is. You know what he knows that he had to run away from. It is vital information required by me in my investigation of a murder. Surely you must see that your position is untenable, you can't possibly get away with it. Twenty Nero Wolfes couldn't bring you out of this with a whole skin. Even if he's cooking up one of his flashy surprises, even if he walks into my office tomorrow with the murderer and the evidence to convict him, I will not stand for this. There is no written record of what you said last night. I'll get the stenographer back in here and we'll tear up his notebook and what he has typed, and you can start from scratch."
"Better grab it, son," Dykes said, perfectly friendly. "Loyalty to your employer is a fine thing, but not when he's got a screw loose."

Archer stood up. "Get a material witness warrant and lock him up," he said, almost squeaking, and marched out.

I can back that statement up with two pieces of evidence: the word of the turnkey on the second-floor cell block, whose name is Wilkes, given to me personally, and my sense of smell, which is above average.
I had no opportunity to make a tour of inspection during the twenty hours I was there, that Easter Sunday and the day following, but except for the smell I found nothing to write to the newspapers about, once you grant that society must

 protect itself against characters like me. My cell - or rather, our cell, since I had a mate - was as clean as they come. There was something about the blankets that made you keep them away from your chin, but that could have been just prejudice. The light was nothing wonderful, but good enough to read by for thirty days.
==> I didn't really get acquainted with my surroundings or my mate until Monday, I was so darned sleepy when they finally finished with me down below and showed me up to my room. They had been insistent but not ferocious. I had been allowed to phone Fritz that I wouldn't be home, which was a good thing, as there was no telling what he would have done with no word from me coming on top of Wolfe's fadeout, and also to try to call Nathaniel Parker, the only lawyer Wolfe has ever been willing to invite to dinner; but that was no go because he was away for the weekend. When at last I stretched out on the cot, I was dead to the world ten seconds after my head hit the pillow, consisting of my pants wrapped in my shirt. <==
It was the pants, or rather the coat and vest that went with them, that made my stay pleasanter than it might have been right from the start. I had had perhaps half as much sleep as I could have used when a hell of a noise banged at me and I lifted my head and opened my eyes. Across the cell on another cot, so far away that I would have had to stretch my arm its full length to touch him, was my cellmate - a broad - shouldered guy about my age, maybe a little older, with a mop of tousled black hair. He was sitting up, yawning.
"What's all the racket?" I asked. "Jail break?"
"Breakfast and check-up in ten minutes," he replied, getting his feet, with socks on, to the floor. "Stupid custom."
"Boneheads," I agreed, twisting up to sit on the edge of the cot.
Going to the chair where his wardrobe was, his eye fell on my chair, and he stepped to it for a look at the coat and vest. He fingered the lapel, looked inside at the lining, and inspected a buttonhole. Then, without comment, he returned to his side, two whole steps, and started to dress. I followed suit.

The turnout and check-up, I discovered, were not to be taken as opportunities for conversation. There were around forty of us, all shapes and sizes, and on the whole we were frankly not a blue-ribbon outfit. The smell of the breakfast added to the disinfectant was enough to account for the expressions on the faces, not counting whatever it was that had got them there, and it was a relief to get back to my cozy cell with my mate.
We had our hands and faces washed, and he had his teeth brushed, when the breakfast came on a big clean aluminum tray. The eats were barely usable if you took Fritz's productions as a standard, but compared with the community meal which I had seen and smelled they were a handsome feast.
My mate having ordered two of everything, there were two morning Gazettes, and before he even touched his orange juice he took his paper and, with no glance at the front page, turned to sports. Finishing his survey of the day's prospects, he drank some orange juice and inquired, "Are you interested in the rapidity of horses?"
"In a way." I added earnestly, "I like the way you talk. I enjoy being with cultured people."
He gave me a suspicious look, saw my honest candid countenance, and relaxed. "That's natural. Look at your clothes."
==> We were on the chairs, with the little wooden table between us. It was comfortable enough except that there was no room to prop up our morning papers. He flattened his out, still open at sports, on the end of the cot, and turned to it while disposing of a bite of food. I arranged mine, front page, on my knee. In the picture of Mrs, Rackham the poor woman looked homelier than she had actually been, which was a darned shame even though she wasn't alive to see it. Wolfe's name and mine both appeared in the sub-heads under the three-column spread about the murder. I glanced at the bottom, followed the instruction to turn to page four, and there saw more pictures. The one of Wolfe was only fair, <==

king him look almost bloated, but the one of me was excellent. There was one of a Doberman pinscher standing at attention. It was captioned Hebe, which I doubted. The play in the text on Wolfe and me was on his sudden retirement from business and absence from the city, and on my presence at the scene of the murder and arrest as a material witness. There was also a report of an interview with Marko Vukcic, a Gazette exclusive, with Lon Cohen's by-line. I would have given at least ten to one that Lon had used my name in getting to Marko.
With the breakfast all down, including the coffee, which was pretty good, I was so interested in my reading that I didn't notice that my mate had finished with sports and proceeded to other current events. What got my attention was the feeling that I was being scrutinized, and sure enough I was. He was looking at me, and then at his page four, and back at me again.
I grinned at him. "Pretty good likeness, huh? But I don't think that's the right dog. I'm no expert, but Hebe isn't quite as slim as that."
He was regarding me with a new expression, not particularly matey. "So you're Nero Wolfe's little Archie."

"I was." I gestured. "Read the paper. Apparently I am now my own little Archie."

supposed you had got snagged in the raid on the Covered Porch. It gets worse all the time, the dicks. Look at this, even here in the can I meet a guy with a suit of clothes like that, and he's a dick!"

"I'll brush my teeth and shave."
"Then what?"
I swiveled my head to glance at him. "You're pretty damn persistent.
Where do you want us to get to?"
"Nowhere in particular." He stayed supine, and I noticed that in profile he
==> looked a little like John L. Lewis, only a lot younger. He went on, "I was just thinking, with Nero Wolfe gone I suppose your job's gone. Can't I think?" <==
"Sure. If it doesn't hurt."
A brief silence. He spoke again. "I've heard about you a little. What kind of a guy are you?"
"Oh - I'm a thinker too, and I'm cultured. I got good marks in algebra. I sleep well. I'm honest and ambitious, with a good personality."
"You know your way around."
"In certain circles, yes. It would be hard to lose me within ten miles of Times Square unless I was blindfolded. What are the requirements of the position you are about to offer?"

He ignored that and took another angle. "My name is Christy - Max Christy. Ever hear of me?"
If I had it was vague, but I saw no point in hurting his feelings. "Max Christy?" I snorted. "Don't be silly."
==> "I thought you might have. I've only been around the big town a couple of years, and I don't toot a horn, but some people get talked about. How much has Wolfe been paying you?" <==


"That's asking," I objected mildly. "I wouldn't want it to get in the papers.
I've been eating all right and I've got a government bond. Anything over - " Footsteps in the corridor stopped at our door, and the turnkey's voice
came. "Mr. Christy! They want you down in the office."

"The business I'm in. What did I say my name is?"
"Max Christy."
"Then what more do you want? Take my being here now, for example. I
got raked in at the Covered Porch yesterday by mistake, but I would have been loose in an hour if it hadn't been Sunday - and Easter too. Here it is" - he looked at his wrist - "not quite noon, and I'm walking out. There has never been an organization to compare with it. For a man like you there would be special jobs and special opportunities if you once got taken in. With your record, which is bad as far as I know it, that would take a while. You would have to show, and show good. Your idea about so many grand a year just isn't realistic, certainly not while you're being tried, but after that it would depend on you. If you've got it in you there's practically no limit. Another thing is income tax."
"Yeah, what about income tax?"
==> "You simply use your judgment. Say Wolfe paid you thirty grand a year, which he didn't, nothing like it, what did you have to say about income tax? Nothing. It was taken out before you got paid - You never even saw it. In this business you make your own decisions about it. You want to be fair, and you want to be in the clear, but you don't want to get gypped, and on that basis you use your judgment." <==
Christy raised his torso and sat on the edge of the cot. "You know,

 Goodwin, I'm just tossing this at you on the spur of the moment. I laid here reading about you, and I thought to myself, here's a man the right age and experience, not married, the right personality, he knows people, he knows lots of cops, he has been a private eye for years and so he would be open to anything that sounds good enough; he is just out of a job, he's got himself tangled in a hot homicide here in Westchester, and he may need help right now. That's what I was thinking, and I thought why not ask him? I can't guarantee anything, especially if you're headed for a murder rap, but if you need help now and then later on you would like a chance at something, I'm Max Christy and I could pass the word along. If you - "

He paused at the sound of footsteps. Wilkes's voice came from the door.

"I'll remember it." I took his offered hand and we shook. "It's been a pleasure. Where can I mail a check for the breakfast?"
"Forget it. It was a privilege. Be seeing you, I hope." He strode out like an executive going to greet a welcome caller, Wilkes holding the door for him.
I sat down on the cot, thinking it was a hell of a note for a Max Christy to get sprung before an Archie Goodwin. What was keeping Parker? In jail a man gets impatient.

==> IT WAS seven o'clock that evening, just getting dark, when I left the car at the curb on West 35th Street in front of Wolfe's house and climbed the seven steps to the stoop. Parker, armed with papers which stated, among other things, that my continued availability to the People of the State of New York was worth ten thousand dollars, had arrived at the jail shortly after two, and in another ten minutes I had been unleashed on society again, but District Attorney Archer had requested another session with me in the presence of my attorney, and Parker and I had obliged. It had dragged on and on, and was really a bore, because there was nothing for me to try to be witty about. Unlike some other occasions when I had been in conference with the law, there was nothing to stimulate me because all I had to do was tell the truth, and all of it - except the sausage part and the phone call from Arnold Zeck. <==
When they had finally called it a day and Parker and I were standing on the sidewalk in front of the courthouse, he asked me, "Am I to know where Wolfe is?"
"I doubt it. He told me not to look for him."
"I see."
His tone of voice irritated me. "Every word you heard me say in there," I
asserted, "was the truth. I haven't the thinnest idea where he is or what he's doing."

"Forget it. It was a privilege. Be seeing you, I hope." He strode out like an executive going to greet a welcome caller, Wilkes holding the door for him.
I sat down on the cot, thinking it was a hell of a note for a Max Christy to get sprung before an Archie Goodwin. What was keeping Parker? In jail a man gets impatient.

"Go to hell," I advised him, and marched off. I couldn't really blame the Westchester bunch, but Parker should have known me well enough to tell which side of my mouth I was talking out of. It's damn discouraging, when you do tell the truth, not to have it recognized.
==> Also discouraging was the welcome I got on entering Wolfe's house that evening. It was in the form of a note stuck in the corner of my desk blotter, unfolded. <==
Dear Archie -
I am sorry you are in jail and hope it will not last long. Mr. Vukcic has been to see me and I am leaving now to go to work for him $1500 - There has been no word from Mr. Wolfe. God grant he is safe and well and I think you should find him no matter what he wrote. I threw out the jar of sardines and stopped the milk. My very best regards and wishes,

I was pleased to observe that he stuck to routine to the end, putting the time down. Also it was nice of him to end his note to me the same as Wolfe had ended his. Nevertheless, it was a discouraging welcome home after a night in the hoosegow. And there had been a period of more than five hours when any phone calls that might have come would not have been answered, something that had never happened before in all the years I had worked and lived there. Unless Theodore ...
I beat it to the stairs and up the three flights, and entered the plant rooms.

I beat it to the stairs and up the three flights, and entered the plant rooms.
One step inside the first room, the warm one, I stopped and surveyed. It was more of a shock, somehow, than it had been a year ago when it had been used as a target for tommy guns from across the street. Then they had at least left a mess; now there was nothing but the benches and stands. It really got me for a minute. I moved on through: medium room, cool room, potting room, spray chamber, Theodore's room - all empty. Hewitt must have sent an army to dean all that out in one day, I thought, heading back downstairs.
In the kitchen was another longer note from Fritz, reporting phone calls that had come before he left and various minor matters. I opened the refrigerator and poked around, and settled for a jar of home-made pate, a hunk of Italian bread, Vermont cheese, and milk. As I sat working at it with an evening paper propped up before me, I kept listening for something - nothing in particular, just something. That had never been a noisy house, hut I had never known it anything like that quiet. Almost no cars went by, and the few that did must have been coasting in neutral.
My meal finished and things put away, I wandered into the dining room, office, front room, down to the basement to Fritz's room, up one flight to Wolfe's room, up another to my room. As I undressed for my post-jail bath, I thought that the hell of it wasn't how I felt, but that I didn't know how to feel. If I had actually seen the last of Nero Wolfe, it was a damn sad day for me, there were no two ways about that, and if I got a lump in my throat and somebody walked in I would just as soon show him the lump as not.
But what if it was Wolfe himself who walked in? That was the trouble. Damned if I was going to work up a fancy lump and then have him suddenly appear and start crabbing about something.

"Right. He's comparatively new to this section, but he's a fast mover. Not
really big yet. As far as I know, the only thing he's close to right in town is a string of rooms for transients. He seems to be specializing on little weekend

 roundups in the suburbs."
"Just games, or women, or what?"
==> "Anything men risk money for. Or pay it for. I have heard that he is seen around sometimes with Brownie Costigan. How curious are you? Is it worth a steak? Or is it worth a phone number or address where I can reach Nero Wolfe?" <==
By that time I had abandoned the idea of selling anyone, even Lon Cohen, the idea that I ever told the truth, so I thanked him and hung up.
A couple of checks in the morning mail, one from a man who was paying in installments for having a blackmailer removed from his throat, were no problem, since there was a rubber stamp for endorsing them, but in order to pay three bills that came in I had to make a trip to 54th Street to see if the formalities about Marko's power of attorney had been attended to. They had, by Parker, and I was glad to see that Marko signed the checks on my say-so, without looking at the bills. If he had started auditing on me I swear to God I would have moved out and got a hotel room.
There were other chores, such as phoning Hewitt's place on Long Island to ask if the plants and Theodore had arrived safely, making arrangements with a phone-answering service, handling a report from Fred Durkin on a poison-letter job that was the main item of unfinished business, and so on, but I managed to have them all under control when two o'clock came and brought Calvin Leeds.
When I went to let him in and took him to the office, there was a problem.
Should I sit at my desk or at Wolfe's? On the one hand, I was not Wolfe and had no intention of trying to be. On the other hand, when a pinch-hitter is called on he stands at the plate to bat, not off to one side. Also it would be interesting to see, from Wolfe's position, what the light was like on the face of a man sitting in the red leather chair. So again, this time intentionally, I sat behind Wolfe's desk.

"I came here to get an explanation," Leeds said, "and I'm going to get it."
He looked as if he could stand a dose of something - if not an explanation, then maybe castor oil. The hide of his face still looked tough and weathered, or rather as if it had been but someone had soaked it in something to make it stretch and get saggy. His eyes looked determined, but not clear and alert as before. No one would have guessed that he had just inherited half a million bucks, and not from a dearly beloved wife or sister but merely a cousin.
Something like a million times I had seen Wolfe, faced with a belligerent statement from a caller, lean back and close his eyes. I thought I might as well try it, and did so. But the springs which let the chair's back slant to the rear were carefully adjusted to the pressure of Wolfe's poundage, not mine, and I had to keep pushing to maintain the damn thing in the leaning position.

a leaning position, and I straightened up. "It often has. But that's not my department."
"I want to see him."
"So do I."
"You're a liar, Goodwin."

"I want to see him."
"So do I."
"You're a liar, Goodwin."
I shook my head, my lips tight. "You know," I said, "I have probably told
==> as many lies as any man my age except psychos. But I have never been called a liar as frequently as in the past twenty-four hours, and I have never stuck so close to the truth. To hell with it. Mr. Wolfe has gone south to train with the Dodgers. He will play shortstop." <==
"That won't help any," Leeds said, patient but determined, "that kind of talk. If you don't like being called a liar, neither do I, and the difference is that I'm not. The District Attorney says I'm lying, because Nero Wolfe has suddenly disappeared, and he disappeared because he doesn't dare answer questions about my cousin Sarah's visit to him here, and that proves that your report of that visit is false, and since my report is the same as yours mine is false too. Now that sounds logical, but there's a flaw in it. The flaw is their assumption that his disappearance was connected with my cousin's visit. I knew it couldn't have been, because there was nothing about our talk that day that could possibly have had such a result. I have told them that, and they think I'm lying. As long as they think I'm lying, and you too, they'll have their minds on that and they won't find out who killed my cousin and why - and anyway, I don't want to be suspected of lying when I'm not, especially not in connection with the murder of my cousin."
Leeds paused for breath and went on, "There's only one way out that I can see, and that's for you to tell them the real reason for Wolfe's disappearance - or, better still, he ought to tell them himself. I want you to put this up to him. Even if his own safety is involved, he ought to manage somehow. If it was something about some client that made him disappear, in the interest of some client, then you can tell him from me that I saw him take a check from my cousin for ten thousand dollars and it seems to me he's under obligation to her as much as any other client, to protect her interests, and it surely isn't in her interest to have suspicion centered in the wrong place about who killed her - and killed her dog too." His jaw quivered a little, and he clamped it tight.
"Do you mean," I inquired, "that suspicion is centered on you? How come?"
"Not on me as - as a murderer, I don't suppose so, but on me as a liar, and

"So do I."
"You're a liar, Goodwin."
I shook my head, my lips tight. "You know," I said, "I have probably told
as many lies as any man my age except psychos. But I have never been called a liar as frequently as in the past twenty-four hours, and I have never stuck so close to the truth. To hell with it. Mr. Wolfe has gone south to train with the Dodgers. He will play shortstop."
"That won't help any," Leeds said, patient but determined, "that kind of talk. If you don't like being called a liar, neither do I, and the difference is that I'm not. The District Attorney says I'm lying, because Nero Wolfe has suddenly disappeared, and he disappeared because he doesn't dare answer questions about my cousin Sarah's visit to him here, and that proves that your report of that visit is false, and since my report is the same as yours mine is false too. Now that sounds logical, but there's a flaw in it. The flaw is their assumption that his disappearance was connected with my cousin's visit. I knew it couldn't have been, because there was nothing about our talk that day that could possibly have had such a result. I have told them that, and they think I'm lying. As long as they think I'm lying, and you too, they'll have their minds on that and they won't find out who killed my cousin and why - and anyway, I don't want to be suspected of lying when I'm not, especially not in connection with the murder of my cousin."
==> Leeds paused for breath and went on, "There's only one way out that I can see, and that's for you to tell them the real reason for Wolfe's disappearance - or, better still, he ought to tell them himself. I want you to put this up to him. Even if his own safety is involved, he ought to manage somehow. If it was something about some client that made him disappear, in the interest of some client, then you can tell him from me that I saw him take a check from my cousin for ten thousand dollars and it seems to me he's under obligation to her as much as any other client, to protect her interests, and it surely isn't in her interest to have suspicion centered in the wrong place about who killed her - and killed her dog too." His jaw quivered a little, and he clamped it tight. <==
"Do you mean," I inquired, "that suspicion is centered on you? How come?"
"Not on me as - as a murderer, I don't suppose so, but on me as a liar, and

 you and Wolfe. Even though she left me a great deal of money - I'm not thinking about being arrested for murder."
"Who do you think ought to be?"

"I don't know." He gestured. "You're trying to change the subject. It's not a question of me and what I think, it's you and what you're going to do. From what I've heard of Wolfe, I doubt if it would help for you to tell him what I've said; I've got to see him and tell him myself. If he has really got to hide from somebody or something, do it however you want to. Blindfold me and put me face down in your car. I've got to see him. My cousin would have wanted me to, and he took her money."
I was half glad there for a moment that I did not know where Wolfe was. I had no admiration for Leeds' preference in pets, since I would put a woman ahead of a Doberman pinscher any day, and there was room for improvement in him in a few other respects, but I couldn't help but admit he had a point and was not being at all unreasonable. So if I had known where Wolfe was I would have had to harden my heart, and as it was all I had to harden was my voice. It struck me then, for the first time, that maybe I shouldn't be so sore at Wolfe after all.
Leeds hung on for another quarter of an hour, and I prolonged it a little myself by trying to get something out of him about the progress the cops had made, without success. He went away mad, still calling me a liar, which kept it unanimous. What he got from me was nothing. What I got from him was that Mrs. Rackham's funeral would be the next morning, Wednesday. Not a profitable way to spend most of an hour, for either of us.
I spent what was left of the afternoon looking into the matter of sausage.

Within ten minutes after the package had been opened that day, Wolfe had phoned both Mummiani and the Fleet Messenger Service and got a blank as expected; but on the outside chance that I might at least get a bone for my curiosity to gnaw on I made a trip to Fulton Street and one uptown.
At Mummiani's no one knew anything. Since Wolfe had been getting Darst's sausage from them for years, and in that time their personnel had come and gone, any number of outsiders could know about it. At the Fleet Messenger Service they were willing to help but couldn't. They remembered the package because Wolfe had phoned about it, but all I learned was that it had been left there by a youth who might have been playing hookey from the eighth grade, and I didn't even bother to listen to the description, such as it was.

Wednesday morning a visitor came that I let in. I had formed the habit,

 since returning from jail, of hearing the doorbell ring, going to the hall, observing through the one-way glass panel who it was out on the stoop, making a face, and returning to the office. If the bell kept ringing long enough to be a nuisance I flipped the switch that turned it off. This time, around eleven Wednesday morning, instead of making a face I went and opened the door and said, "Well, hello! Coming in?"

I let him lead the way to the office. This time I sat at my own desk. I was tempted to take Wolfe's chair again just to see how he would react, but it would have put me at a disadvantage, I was so used to dealing with him, in the red leather chair, from my own angle.
He eyed me. "So you're holding the fort," he growled.
"Not exactly," I objected. "I'm only the caretaker. Or maybe I'm going down with the ship. Not that those who have left are rats."
"Where's Wolfe?"

"Listen," I said, friendly but firm. "That routine is all right for people like district attorneys and state cops and the representatives of the press, but you're above it. Either I don't know where he is, or I do know but I'm sitting on it. What's the difference? Next question."

"What about the sausage that turned into tear gas? Any connection?"

"Did the tear gas scare him out of his skin? Or out of his house, which is the same thing. Was that it?"
"It might have, mightn't it? A coward like him?"
"No." Cramer put the cigar between his teeth, tilted up. "No, there are plenty of things about Wolfe I can and do object to, but he's not a coward. There might have been something about that tear gas that would have scared anybody. Was there?"
"As far as I know, it was just plain tear gas, nothing fancy." I decided to shove a little. "You know, it's nice to have you here any time, just for company, but aren't you spreading out some? Your job is homicide, and the tear gas didn't even make us sick, let alone kill us. Also your job is in the County of New York, and Mrs. Rackham died in Westchester. I enjoy talking with you, but have you got credentials?"
He made a noise that could have been a chuckle. "That's more like it," he said, not sarcastically. "You're beginning to sound natural. I'll tell you. I'm here at the request of Ben Dykes, who would give all his teeth and one ear to clear up the Rackham case ahead of the state boys. He thinks that Archer, the DA, may have swallowed the idea that you and Leeds are lying too deep, and he came to me as an expert on Nero Wolfe, which God knows I am. He laid it all out for me and wanted my opinion."

He thinks that Archer, the DA, may have swallowed the idea that you and Leeds are lying too deep, and he came to me as an expert on Nero Wolfe, which God knows I am. He laid it all out for me and wanted my opinion."
He shifted the cigar to a new angle. "The way it looked to me, there were three possibilities. First, the one that Archer has sold himself on, that you and Leeds are lying, and that what Mrs. Rackham really told Wolfe when she came here, together with her getting murdered the next day, somehow put Wolfe on a spot that was too hot for him, and he scooted, after fixing with you to cover as well as you could. I told Dykes I would rule that out, for various reasons - chiefly because neither you nor Wolfe would risk that much on a setup that depended on a stranger like Leeds sticking to a lie. Shall I analyze it more?"
"No, thanks, that'll do."
"I thought so. Next, the possibility that when you phoned Wolfe right after the body was found you told him something that gave him a line on the

I am always ready for Inspector Cramer, in the light of experience guided by intelligence, and therefore didn't bat an eye. I merely cocked my head a little, met his gaze, and considered the matter until I was satisfied. "I doubt if it was Fritz," I stated. "Mr. Wolfe has him too well trained. But in the excitement Sunday morning, Mr. Wolfe being gone, Fritz told Theodore, and you got it out of Theodore." I nodded. "That must be it."
"Did the tear gas scare him out of his skin? Or out of his house, which is the same thing. Was that it?"
"It might have, mightn't it? A coward like him?"
"No." Cramer put the cigar between his teeth, tilted up. "No, there are plenty of things about Wolfe I can and do object to, but he's not a coward. There might have been something about that tear gas that would have scared anybody. Was there?"
"As far as I know, it was just plain tear gas, nothing fancy." I decided to shove a little. "You know, it's nice to have you here any time, just for company, but aren't you spreading out some? Your job is homicide, and the tear gas didn't even make us sick, let alone kill us. Also your job is in the County of New York, and Mrs. Rackham died in Westchester. I enjoy talking with you, but have you got credentials?"
==> He made a noise that could have been a chuckle. "That's more like it," he said, not sarcastically. "You're beginning to sound natural. I'll tell you.

 murderer, but it's tricky and he had to go outdoors to get his evidence, preparing to grandstand it for the front page. I told Dykes I would rule that out too. Wolfe is quite capable of a play like that, sure he is, but if that's all it amounted to, why move the plants out and put Frits to work in a restaurant and list the house for sale? He's colorful, but not that colorful. Mrs. Rackham only paid him ten thousand, about what I make a year. Why should he spend it having his orchids carted around?"

"I've got all day, but Fritz isn't here to get our lunch."
"We'll go without." He clasped his hands behind his head and shifted his center of gravity. "You know, Archie, sometimes I'm not as far behind as you think I am."

"Also sometimes I don't think you're as far behind as you think I do."
"That's possible. Anyhow, I can add. I think he got word direct from Arnold Zeck. Did he?"

"That's possible. Anyhow, I can add. I think he got word direct from Arnold Zeck. Did he?"
"Huh? Who's Arnold Zeck? Did you just make it up?"
I knew that was a mistake the instant it was out of my mouth. Then I had to try to keep it from showing on my face, the realization that I had fumbled it, but whether that was a success or not - and I couldn't very well look in a mirror to find out - it was too late.
Cramer looked pleased. "So you've been around all these years, a working detective, meeting the people you do, and you've never heard of Arnold Zeck. Either I've got to believe that, or I touched a tender spot."
"Sure I've heard of him. It just didn't click for a second."
==> "Oh, for God's sake. It's affecting you already, having Wolfe gone. That wasn't just a shot in the dark. One day two years ago I sat here in this chair. Wolfe sat there." He nodded at Wolfe's chair. "You were where you are now. A man named Orchard had been murdered, and so had a woman named Poole. In the course of our long talk Wolfe explained in detail how an ingenious and ruthless man could operate a blackmail scheme, good for at least a million a year, without sticking his neck out. Not only could; it was being done. Wolfe refused to name him, and since he wasn't behind the murders it was out of my territory, but a thing or two I heard and a couple of things that happened gave me <==

 a pretty clear idea. Not only me - it was whispered around: Arnold Zeck. You may perhaps remember it."
"I remember the Orchard case, certainly," I conceded. "I didn't hear the whispering."
"I did. You may also remember that a year later, last summer, Wolfe's plant rooms got shot up from a roof across the street."
"Yep. I was sitting right here and heard it."

"So I understand. Since no one was killed that never got to me officially, but naturally I heard things. Wolfe had started to investigate a man named Rony, and Rony's activities were the kind that might lead a first-class investigator like Wolfe in the direction of Arnold Zeck, maybe up close to Zeck, possibly even clear to him. I thought then that Wolfe had got warned off, by Zeck himself or someone near him, and he had disregarded it, and for a second warning they messed up his orchids. Then Rony got killed, and that was a break for Wolfe because it put him and Zeck on the same side."
"Gosh," I remarked, "it sounds awful complicated to me."
"I'll bet it does." Cramer moved the cigar - getting shorter now, although he never lit one - to the other side of his mouth. "All I'm doing is showing you that I'm not just hoping for a bite, and I don't want to string it out. It was a good guess that Wolfe had jostled up against Arnold Zeck in both the Orchard case and the Rony case, and now what happens? Not long after Mrs. Rackham calls on him and hires him to check on her husband's income, someone sends him a cylinder of tear gas - not a bomb to blow out his guts, which it could have been, just tear gas, so of course it was for a warning. And that night Mrs. Rackham gets murdered. You tell him about it on the phone, and when you get home he's gone."
Cramer took the cigar from his mouth and pointed it at me. "I'll tell you what I believe, Archie. I believe that if Wolfe had stayed and helped, the murderer of Mrs. Rackham would be locked up by now. I believe that he had reason to think that if he did that, helped to catch the murderer, he would have to spend the rest of his life trying to keep Arnold Zeck from getting him. I believe that he decided that the only way out was for him to get Zeck. How's that?"

 reach. It's a goddam crime for an officer of the law to have to say a thing like that, even privately, but it's true. Here's a murder case, and thank God it's not mine. I'm not pointing at Ben Dykes or the DA up there, I'm not pointing at any person or persons, but if the setup is that Barry Rackham is tied in with one or more of Zeck's operations, and if Rackham killed his wife, I say he will never burn, I don't say at what point Zeck will get his hand in, or who or what he will use, but Rackham will never burn."
Cramer hurled his cigar at my wastebasket and missed it a foot. Since it wasn't lit I ignored it. "Hooray for justice," I cheered.
He snarled, but apparently not at me. "I want you to tell Wolfe that. Zeck is out of his reach. He can't get him."
"But," I objected, "granting that you've got it all straight, which I haven't, that's a hell of a message. Look at it from the other end. He is not out of Zeck's reach, not if he comes home. I know he doesn't go out much, but even if he never did people have to come in - and things, like packages of sausage. Not to mention that the damage they did to the plants and equipment last year came to thirty-eight thousand bucks. I get the idea that he is to lay off of Zeck, but that's only what he doesn't do.

"I wouldn't expect any. Now here's what I came for. I want you to give
Wolfe a personal message from me, not as a police officer but as a friend. This is between you and me - and him. Zeck is out of his reach. He is out of anybody's

 reach. It's a goddam crime for an officer of the law to have to say a thing like that, even privately, but it's true. Here's a murder case, and thank God it's not mine. I'm not pointing at Ben Dykes or the DA up there, I'm not pointing at any person or persons, but if the setup is that Barry Rackham is tied in with one or more of Zeck's operations, and if Rackham killed his wife, I say he will never burn, I don't say at what point Zeck will get his hand in, or who or what he will use, but Rackham will never burn."
Cramer hurled his cigar at my wastebasket and missed it a foot. Since it wasn't lit I ignored it. "Hooray for justice," I cheered.
==> He snarled, but apparently not at me. "I want you to tell Wolfe that. Zeck is out of his reach. He can't get him." <==
"But," I objected, "granting that you've got it all straight, which I haven't, that's a hell of a message. Look at it from the other end. He is not out of Zeck's reach, not if he comes home. I know he doesn't go out much, but even if he never did people have to come in - and things, like packages of sausage. Not to mention that the damage they did to the plants and equipment last year came to thirty-eight thousand bucks. I get the idea that he is to lay off of Zeck, but that's only what he doesn't do. What does he do?"
Cramer nodded. "I know. That's it. He's so damn bullheaded. I want you to understand, Archie, why I came here. Wolfe is too cocky to live. He has enough brass and bluster to outfit a thousand sergeants. Sure, I know him; I ought to. I would love to bloody his nose for him, I've tried to often enough, and some day I will and enjoy it. But I would hate to see him break his neck on a deal like this where he hasn't got a chance. It's a good guess that in the past ten years there have been over a hundred homicides in this town that were connected in one way or another with one of the operations Arnold Zeck has a hand in. But not in a single case was there the remotest hope of tying Zeck up with it. We couldn't possibly have touched him."
"You're back where you started," I complained. "He can't be reached. So what?"
"So Wolfe should come back where he belongs, return what Mrs. Rackham paid him to her estate, let the Westchester people take care of the murder, which is their job anyhow, and go on as before. You can tell him I said that, but by God don't quote me around. I'm not responsible for a man like Zeck being out of reach."
"But you never strained a muscle stretching for him."

==> At first, that first night, I was thinking that word might come from Wolfe in the next hour. Then I started thinking it might come the next day. As the days kept creeping along they changed my whole attitude, and before the end of April I was thinking it might come next week. By the time May had passed, and most of June, and the calendar and the heat both said summer, I was beginning to think it might never come. <==
But first to finish with April. The Rackham case followed the routine of spectacular murders when they never quite get to the point of a first-degree charge against anyone. For a week, the front page by unanimous consent; then, for a week or ten days, the front page only by cooking up an angle; and then back to the minors. None of the papers happened to feel like using it to start a crusade in the name of justice, so it took a normal course. It did not roll over and die, not with that all-star cast, including Nobby and Hebe; even months later a really new development would have got a three-column spread; but the development didn't come.
I made three more trips, by official request, to White Plains, with no profit to anyone, including me. All I could do was repeat myself, and all they could do was think up new ways to ask the same questions. For mental exercise I tried to get a line on whether Cramer's notions about Arnold Zeck had been passed on to Archer and Ben Dykes, but if so they never let on.
All I knew was what I read in the papers, until one evening I ran into Sergeant Purley Stebbins at Jake's and bought him a lobster. From him I got two little unpublished items: two FBI men had been called in to settle an argument about the legibility of fingerprints on the crinkly silver handle of the knife, and had voted no; and at one point Barry Rackham had been held at White Plains for twenty straight hours while the battle raged over whether they had enough to charge him. The noes won that time too.
The passing days got very little help from me. I had decided not to start pawing the ground or rearing up until Wolfe had been gone a full month, which would be May ninth, and I caught up on a lot of personal things, including baseball games, which don't need to be itemized. Also, with Fred Durkin, I finished up the poison-pen case and other loose ends that Wolfe had left dangling - nothing important - drove out to Long Island to see if Theodore and the plants had got settled in their new home, and put one of the cars, the big sedan, in dead storage.
THREE weeks went by.

THREE weeks went by.
One afternoon when I went to Rusterman's Restaurant to see Marko

 Vukcic he signed the checks I had brought, for telephone and electricity bills and my weekly salary, and then asked me what the bank balance was. I told him a little over twenty-nine thousand dollars, but I sort of regarded Mrs. Rackham's ten grand as being in escrow, so I would rather call it nineteen.
"Could you bring me a check for five thousand tomorrow? Drawn to cash."

"Why - expense."
"Speaking as a man who may some day have to answer questions from an
internal revenue snoop, whose expense and what kind?" "Call it travel expense."
"Travel by whom and to where?"
Marko made some kind of a French noise, or foreign at least, indicating impatience, I think. "Listen, Archie, I have a power of attorney without limit. Bring me a check for five thousand dollars at your convenience. I am stealing it from my old friend Nero to spend on beautiful women or olive oil."
==> So I was not entirely correct when I said that I got no word at all from Wolfe during those weeks and months, but you must admit it was pretty vague. How far a man gets on five grand, and where he goes, depends on so many things. <==
When I returned to the office from a morning walk on the third day of May, a Wednesday, and called the phone-answering service as usual, I was told there had been three calls but only one message - to ring a Mount Kisco number and ask for Mrs. Frey. I considered the situation, told myself the thing to do was skip it, and decided that I must be hard of hearing when I became aware that I had dialed the operator and asked for the number.
Then, after I had got it and spelled my name and waited a minute, Annabel Frey's voice was in my ear. At least the voice said it was her, but I wouldn't have recognized it. It was sort of tired and hopeless.
"You don't sound like you," I told her.
"I suppose not," she conceded. "It seems like a million years since you came that day and we watched you being a detective. You never found out who poisoned the dog, did you?"
"No, but don't hold it against me. I wasn't expected to. You may have heard that that was just a blind."

"I suppose not," she conceded. "It seems like a million years since you came that day and we watched you being a detective. You never found out who poisoned the dog, did you?"
"No, but don't hold it against me. I wasn't expected to. You may have heard that that was just a blind."
==> "Yes, of course. I don't suppose Nero Wolfe is back?" "Nope." <==
"You're running his office for him?"
"Well, I wouldn't call it running. I'm here."


"I want to see you."

"I want to see you."
"Excuse me for staring, but do you mean on business?"
"Yes." A pause, then her voice got more energetic. "I want you to come up
==> here and talk with us. I don't want to go on like this, and I'm not going to. When people look at me I can see it: in their eyes - was it me that killed my mother-in- law? - or in some of them I can see it, and that makes me think it's there with all of them. It's been nearly a month now, and all the police are doing - but you read the papers. She left me this place and a lot of money, and I wish I could hire Nero Wolfe. You must know where he is." <==
"Sorry. I don't."
"Then I want to hire you. You're a good detective, aren't you?" "Opinions vary. I rate myself close to the top, but you have to discount
that for my bias."
"Could you come up here today? This evening?"
"I couldn't make it today." My brain was having some exercise for the first

time in weeks. "Look, Mrs. Frey, I wouldn't be in a hurry about this. There's - " "A hurry?" She sounded bitter. "It's been nearly a month!"
"I know, and that's why another few days won't matter. There's nothing
fresh about it, to get stale. Why don't you do this, let me do a little looking around, just on my own, and then you'll hear from me. After that you can decide whether you want to hire me or not."
"I've already decided."
"I haven't. I don't want your dough if there's no chance of earning it." Since her mind had been made up before she called me, she didn't like it
==> my way but finally settled for it. I discovered when I hung up that my mind was made up too. It had made itself up while I was talking to her. I couldn't go on like this forever, nothing but a damn caretaker with no telling from day to day how long it might last. Nor could I, while drawing pay as Wolfe's assistant, take a boat for Europe or run for Mayor of New York or buy an island and build up a harem, or any of the other things on my deferred list; and certainly, while taking his pay, I couldn't personally butt into a case that he had run away from. <==
But there was nothing to prevent me from taking advantage of the gratitude that was still felt, even after paying the fee, by certain former clients of ours, and I took up the phone again and got the president of one of the big realty outfits, and was glad to learn that I hadn't overestimated his gratitude. When I had explained my problem he said he would do all he could to help, starting right then.
So I spent the afternoon looking at offices in the midtown section. All I wanted was one little room with a light that worked, but the man that the realty

 president sent to go around with me was more particular than I was, and he turned his nose up at two or three that I would have bought. We finally got to one on Madison Avenue, tenth floor, in the forties, which he admitted might do. It wouldn't be vacated until the next day, but that didn't matter much because I still had to buy furniture. I was allowed to sign for it on a month-to-month basis.
The next couple of days I had to keep myself under control. I had never been aware of any secret longing to have my own agency, but I had to choke off an impulse to drop in at Macgruder's Thursday morning and blow a couple of thousand of my own jack on office equipment. Instead, I went to Second Avenue and found bargains. Having decided not to take anything from 35th Street, I made up a shopping list of about forty items, from ash trays to a Moorhead's Directory, and shot the works. Late Saturday afternoon, with a package under my arm, I emerged from the elevator, went down the hall to the door of 1019, and backed off to give it a look.

I left him still wanting to argue.
I was not kidding myself that I had really cut loose, since I hadn't moved
my bed out, but the way I figured it a caretaker who is drawing no pay has a right to a room; and besides, Fritz was still sleeping there and we were splitting

 on the groceries for breakfast, and I didn't want to insult either him or my stomach by breaking that up.
==> I shall now have to specify when I say office - or, better, I'll say office when I mean Wolfe's office, and when I mean my Madison Avenue suite I'll say 1019. Monday morning, arriving at 1019 a little after ten, I rang the phone- answering service and was told that there had been no calls, and then dug into the morning mail, which consisted of a folder from a window-cleaning outfit. After giving it full consideration, I typed notes on my new stationery to some personal friends, and an official letter to the City of New York giving notice of my change of address as a licensed detective. I was sitting trying to think who else I might write to when the phone rang - my first incoming call. <==
I picked it up and told the transmitter plainly, "Archie Goodwin's office." "May I speak to Mr. Goodwin, please?"
"I'll see if he's in. Who is calling, please?"
"Mrs. Frey."
"Yes, he's in. This is me. You got my note?"
'It came this morning. I don't know what you mean about representing no one but yourself."

"Yes, he's in. This is me. You got my note?"
'It came this morning. I don't know what you mean about representing no one but yourself."
==> "I guess I didn't make it very clear. I only meant I wouldn't be acting as Nero Wolfe's assistant. I'm just myself now." <==
"Oh. Well - naturally, if you don't even know where he is. Can you come this evening?"
"To Birchvale?"
"Yes."
"What time?"
"Say eight-thirty."

"Then they understand why I wasn't much interested in anyone but Rackham. And you and Miss Darrow, of course, but that interest wasn't professional. It looks to me like a case that will probably never be solved by exhibits or testimony on facts. The cops have had plenty of good men on it, and if they had got anything usable on footprints or fingerprints, or getting the steak knife from the drawer, or alibis or timetables, or something like shoes that had been worn in the woods, someone would have been arrested long ago. And they've had it for a month, so no kind of routine would be any good now, and that's all most detective work amounts to. Motive is no help, with four of you inheriting piles from two hundred grand up, and the other two possibly counting

 on marrying one of the piles. Only I must say, in the atmosphere here tonight, courtship doesn't seem to be on the program."
"It isn't," Annabel asserted.
I glanced at Hammond and Pierce, but neither of them seemed to want the floor.
==> "So," I continued, "unless the cops have got a trap set that you don't know about, it's one of those things. You never can tell. It would be a waste of money to pay me to go over the ground the cops have covered - or any other detective except Nero Wolfe, and he's not around. There's only one way to use me, or anyhow only one way to start, and stand a chance of getting your money's worth, and that would be to give me a good eight or ten hours with each of you six people, each one separately. I have watched and listened to Nero Wolfe a good many years and I can now do a fair imitation. <==
It might possibly rum out to be worth it to all of you - except one, as Mr. Pierce would say."
I flipped a hand. "That's the best suggestion I can offer. With nothing like a guarantee."
Annabel said, "No one would tell you everything you asked. I haven't myself, to the police."
"Sure. I understand that. That's part of it."
"You would be working for me - for us. It would be confidential." 'Things that weren't used would be confidential. Nothing that was

do now. I don't know what I would think after I had worked at it." "Do you think you know which one?"
"Nope. I'm impartial."
"All right. You can start with me." She turned her head. "Unless one of
you would rather first?"
No one moved or spoke. Then Calvin Leeds: "Count me out, Annabel. Not
==> with Goodwin. Let him tell us first where Nero Wolfe is and why." "But Cal - you won't?" <==
"Not with him I won't."
"Dana?"
Hammond looked unhappy. He got up and went to her. "Annabel, this was
a mistake. The whole idea was no good. What can Goodwin do that the police couldn't do? I doubt if you have any conception of how a private detective works."
"He can try. Will you help, Dana?"

"Oliver? Will you?"
"Well." The statesman was frowning, not at her, at me. "This seems to me
to be a case of all or none. I don't see how anything could be accomplished - " "Then you refuse me too?"
"Under the circumstances I have no other course."
"I see. You won't even give me a straight no. Barry?"
==> "Certainly not. Goodwin has lied to the police about my wife's visit to Wolfe. I wouldn't give him eight seconds, let alone eight hours." <==
Annabel left her chair and went toward the couch. "Lina, I guess it's up to the women. You and me. She was darned good to us, Lina - both of us. What about it?"
"Darling," Lina Darrow said. She sat up. "Darling Annabel. You know you don't like me."
That isn't true," Annabel protested. "Just because - "
"Of course it's true. You thought I was trying to squeeze you out. You thought I was making a play for Barry merely because I was willing to admit he might be human, so wait and see. You thought I was trying to snatch Oilie from you, when as a matter of fact - "
"Lina, for God's sake," Pierce implored her.

I left her. By the time I got out to the parking space the cars of the other guests were gone. Rolling down the curving driveway, I was thinking that my first incoming phone call hadn't been so damned magnificent after all.

XII
ONE or two of my friends have tried to tell me that some of my experiences that summer are worth telling about, but even taking them at their word,
I'm not going to drag it in here. However, it is true that after I ran an ad in the Gazette and word got around I soon quit keeping count of the incoming calls. All I'll do here is summarize it by months; May. Woman with pet cat stolen. Got it back; fifty dollars and expenses. Guy who got rolled in a joint on Eighth Avenue and didn't want to call the cops. Found her and scared most of it out of her. Two Cs for me. Man who wanted his son pried loose from a blond sharpie. Shouldn't have tried it; fell on my nose; took a C above expenses anyhow. Restaurant with a dumb cashier with sticky fingers; took only one afternoon to hook her; client beefed about my request for sixty-five dollars but paid it.
==> June. Spent two full weeks handling a hot insurance case for Del Bascom and damn near got my skull cracked for good. Cleaned it up. Del had the nerve to offer me three Cs; demanded a grand and got it. My idea was to net more per week than I had been getting from Wolfe, not that I cared for the money, but as a matter of principle. Found a crooked bookie for a man from Meadville, Pa. A hundred and fifty dollars. Man wanted me to find his vanished wife, but it looked dim and he could pay only twenty bucks a day, so I passed it. Girl unjustly accused, she said, of giving secret business dope to a rival firm, and fired from her job, pestered me into tackling it. Proved she was right and got her job back, doing five hundred dollars' worth of work for a measly hundred and twenty, paid in installments. Her face wasn't much, but she had a nice voice and good legs. Got an offer of a job from the FBI, my ninth offer from various sources in six weeks, and turned it down. <==
July. Took a whirl at supervising ten men for a bunch of concessionaires at Coney Island; caught one of them taking a cut from doobey stands; he jumped me with a cooler and I broke his arm. Got tired of looking at a thousand acres of bare skin, mostly peeling, practically all nonseductive, and quit. Eight fifty for seventeen days. Had passed up at least two thousand worth of little chores. Screwball woman on Long Island had had jewelry stolen, uninsured, thought cops were in on it and stalling. Two things happened; I got some breaks, and I did a damn good piece of work. It took me into August. I got all the jewelry back, hung it on an interior decorator's assistant with proof, billed her for thirty- five hundred gross, and collected.


August. I had drawn no pay from Wolfe's checkbook since May sixth, I
had not gone near my personal safe deposit box, and my personal bank balance had not only not sunk, it had lifted. I decided I had a vacation coming. The most I had ever been able to talk Wolfe out of was two weeks, and I thought I should double that at least. A friend of mine, whose name has appeared in print in connection with one of Wolfe's cases, had the idea that we should take a look at Norway, and her point of view seemed sound.

A friend of mine, whose name has appeared in print in connection with one of Wolfe's cases, had the idea that we should take a look at Norway, and her point of view seemed sound.
Slow but sure, I was working myself around to an attitude toward life without Nero Wolfe on a permanent basis. One thing that kept it slow was the fact that early in July Marko Vukcic had asked me to bring him another check for five grand drawn to cash. Since if you wanted to eat in his restaurant you had to reserve a table a day in advance, and then pay six bucks for one helping of guinea hen, I knew he wasn't using it himself, so who was? Another thing, the house hadn't been sold, and, doing a little snooping on my own account, I had learned that the asking price was a hundred and twenty thousand, which was plain silly. On the other hand, if Marko was getting money to Wolfe, that didn't prove that I was ever going to see him again, and there was no hurry about selling the house until the bank balance began to sag; and also there was Wolfe's safe deposit box. Visiting his safe deposit box was one item on the select list of purposes for which Wolfe had been willing to leave his house.
I did not really want to leave New York, especially to go as far as Norway. I had a feeling that I would about be passing Sandy Hook when word would come somehow, wire or phone or letter or messenger, to 35th Street or 1019, in a code that I would understand - if I was there to get it. And if it did come I wanted to be there, or I might be left out of the biggest charade Wolfe had ever staged. But it hadn't been days or weeks, it had been months, and my friend was pretty good at several things, including riding me about hanging on forever to the short end of the stick, so we had reservations on a ship that sailed August twenty-sixth.
Four days before that, August twenty-second, a Tuesday afternoon, I was sitting at my desk at 1019, to keep an appointment with a man who had phoned. I had told him I was soon leaving for a month's vacation, and he hadn't felt like giving a name, but I thought I recognized the voice and had agreed to see him. When he walked in on the dot, at 3:15,I was glad to know that my memory for voices was holding up. It was my old cellmate, Max Christy.
I got up and we shook. He put his panama on the desk and glanced around. His black mop was cut a little shorter than it had been in April, but the jungle of his eyebrows hadn't been touched, and his shoulders looked just as broad in gray tropical worsted. I invited him to sit and he did.

And if it did come I wanted to be there, or I might be left out of the biggest charade Wolfe had ever staged. But it hadn't been days or weeks, it had been months, and my friend was pretty good at several things, including riding me about hanging on forever to the short end of the stick, so we had reservations on a ship that sailed August twenty-sixth. <==
Four days before that, August twenty-second, a Tuesday afternoon, I was sitting at my desk at 1019, to keep an appointment with a man who had phoned. I had told him I was soon leaving for a month's vacation, and he hadn't felt like giving a name, but I thought I recognized the voice and had agreed to see him. When he walked in on the dot, at 3:15,I was glad to know that my memory for voices was holding up. It was my old cellmate, Max Christy.
I got up and we shook. He put his panama on the desk and glanced around. His black mop was cut a little shorter than it had been in April, but the jungle of his eyebrows hadn't been touched, and his shoulders looked just as broad in gray tropical worsted. I invited him to sit and he did.


"I must apologize," I said, "for never settling for that breakfast. It was a

 brass in the circles that Max Christy moved in. This bird was a complete stranger. With more skin supplied for his face than was needed, it had taken up the slack in pleats and wrinkles, and that may have accounted for his sporting a pointed brown beard, since it must be hard to shave pleats.
As the car crossed the avenue and continued west, I told him, "I came to oblige Max Christy - if suggestions might help any. I'll only be around till Saturday."
He said, "My name's Roeder," and spelled it.
I thanked him for the confidence. He broadened it. "I'm from the West Coast, in case you wonder how I rate. I followed something here and found it was tied in with certain operations. I'd just as soon leave it to local talent and go back home, but I'm hooked and I have to stick." Either he preferred talking through his nose or that was the only way he knew. "Christy told you we want a man tailed?"
"Yes. I explained that I'm not available."
==> "You have got to be available. There's too much involved." He was twisted around to face me. "It'll be harder than ever now, because he's on guard. It's been messed up. They say if anyone can do it you can, especially with the help of a couple of men that Nero Wolfe used. You can get them, can't you?" <==
"Yeah, I can get them, but I can't get me. I won't be here."
'"You're here now. You can start tomorrow. As Christy told you, five Cs a day. It's a straight tailing job, where you're working for a man named Roeder from Los Angeles. The cops might not like it too well if you tied in with a local like Wilts or Brownie Costigan, but what's wrong with me? You never heard of me before. You're in business as a private detective. I want to hire you, at a good price, to keep a tail on a man named Rackham and report to me on his movements. That's all, a perfectly legitimate job."
We had crossed Park Avenue. The light was dim enough that I didn't have to be concerned about my face showing a reaction to the name Rackham. The reaction inside me was my affair.
"How long would it last?" I inquired.
"I don't know. A day, a week, possibly two."

"Forget it. If that's the kind of interest you've got in Rackham you wouldn't tell me anyhow. But another thing: Rackham knows me. It's twice as hard to tail a guy that knows you. Why hire a man that's handicapped to begin with? Why not - "
I held it because we had stopped for a red light, on Fifth Avenue in the Seventies, and our windows were open, and the open window of a car alongside was only arm's distance away.
When the light changed and we rolled again Roeder spoke. "I'll tell you, Goodwin, this thing's touchy. There'll be some people scattered around that are in on things together, and they trust each other up to a point. As long as their interests all run the same way they can trust each other pretty well. But when something comes up that might help some and hurt others, then it gets touchy. Then each man looks out for himself, or he decides where the strength is and lines up there. That's where I am, where the strength is. But I'm not trying to line you up; we wouldn't want to even if we could; how could we trust you? You're an outsider. All we want you for is an expert tailing job, and you report to me and me only. Where are you going. Bill?"
The driver half-turned his head to answer, "Here in the park it might be cooler."
"It's no cooler anywhere. I like straight streets. Get out again, will you?"
==> The driver said he would, in a hurt tone. Roeder returned to me. "There are three men named Panzer, Gather, and Durkin who worked for Nero Wolfe off <==

 and on. That right?"
I said it was.
"They'll work for you, won't they?"
I said I thought they would.

"Saul Panzer is the best man alive. Gather and Durkin are way above
average."
"That's all you'll need. Now I want to ask you something, but first here's a
remark. It's a bad thing to mislead a client, I'm sure you realize that, but in this case it would be worse than bad. I don't have to go into details, do I?"
"No, but you're going too fast. I haven't got a client."
==> "Oh, yes, you have." Roeder smiled. "Would I waste my time like this? You were there when Mrs. Rackham was killed, you phoned Nero Wolfe <==
and in six hours he was gone, and you were held as a material witness. Now here I want to hire you to tail Rackham, and you don't know why. Can you say no? Impossible."
"It could be," I suggested, "that I've had all I want."
"Not you, from what I've heard. That's all right, not being able to let go is a good thing in a man, but it brings up this question I mentioned. You're on your own now apparently, but you were with Nero Wolfe a long time. You're still living in his house. Of course you're in touch with him - don't bother to deny it - but that's no concern of ours as long as he doesn't get in the way. Only on this job it has to be extra plain that you're working for the man who pays you. If you get facts about Rackham and peddle them elsewhere, to Nero Wolfe for example, you would be in a very bad situation. Perhaps you know how bad?"
"Sure, I know. If I were standing up my knees would give. Just for the record, I don't know where Mr. Wolfe is, I'm not in touch with him, and I'm in no frame of mind to peddle him anything. If I take this on, tailing Rackham, it will be chiefly because I've got my share of monkey in me. I doubt if Mr. Wolfe, wherever he is, would recognize the name Rackham if he heard it."
The brown pointed beard waggled as Roeder shook his head. "Don't over - play it, Goodwin."

==> The driver's head jerked around for a darting glance at me. We had left the park and were back on Fifth Avenue, headed uptown in the Eighties. My remarks about Wolfe were merely casual, because my mind was on something else. Who was after Rackham and why? If it was Zeck, or someone in one of Zeck's lines of command, then something drastic had happened since the April day when Zeck had sent Wolfe a package of sausage and phoned him to let Rackham alone. If it wasn't Zeck, then Max Christy and this Roeder were lined up against Zeck, which made them about as safe to play with as an atomic stockpile. Either way, how could I resist it? Besides, I liked the logic of it. Nearly five months ago Mrs. Rackham had hired us to do a survey on her husband, and paid in advance, and we had let it slide. Now I could take up where we had left off. If Roeder and his colleagues, whoever they were, wanted to pay me for it, there was no use offending them by refusing. <==
So, rolling north on the avenue, Roeder and I agreed that we agreed in principle and got down to brass tacks. Since Rackham was on guard it couldn't be an around-the-clock operation with less than a dozen men, and I had three at the most. Or did I? Saul and Fred and Orrie might not be immediately available. There was no use discussing an operation until I found out if I had any operators. Having their phone numbers in my head, I suggested that we stop at a drugstore and use a booth, but Roeder didn't like that. He thought it would be better to go to my office and phone from there, and I had no objection, so he told the driver to go over to Madison and downtown.
At that hour, getting on toward eleven, Madison Avenue was wide open, and so was the curb in front of the office building. Roeder told the driver we would be an hour or more, and we left him parked there. In the brighter light of the elevator the pleats of Roeder's face were less noticeable, and he didn't look as old as I would have guessed him in the car, but I could see there was a little gray in his beard. He stood propped in a corner with his shoulders slumped and his eyes closed until the door opened for the tenth floor, and then came to and followed me down the hall to 1019. I unlocked the door and let us in, switched on the light, motioned him to a chair, sat at the desk, pulled the phone to me, and started dialing.
"Wait a minute," he said gruffly.
I put it back on the cradle, looked at him, got a straight clear view of his eyes for the first time, and felt a tingle in the small of my back. But I didn't know why.
"This must not be heard," he said. "I mean you and me. How sure are

I got up and went halfway. He got up and came halfway. As we shook, our eyes met, and I deliberately focused on his eyes, because otherwise I would have

 been shaking with a stranger, and one hell of a specimen to boot. We returned to our chairs.
As I sat down I told him courteously, "You'll have to excuse me if I shut my eyes or look away from time to time. It'll take a while to get adjusted."
XIII
==> "No OTHER course," Wolfe said, "was possible. I had accepted money from Mrs. Rackham and she had been murdered. I was committed in her interest, and therefore against Arnold Zeck, and I was no match for him. I had to ambush him. With me gone, how should you act? You should act as if I had disappeared and you knew nothing. Under what circumstances would you do that most convincingly? You are capable of dissimulation, but why try you so severely? Why not merely - " <==
"Skip it," I told him. "Save it for later. Where do we stand now, and what chance have we got? Any at all?"
"I think so, yes. If the purpose were merely to expose one or more of Zeck's operations, it could be done like that." He snapped his fingers. "But since he must himself be destroyed - all I can say is that I have reached the point where you can help. I have talked with him three times."
"Exactly who and what are you?"
"I come from Los Angeles. When I left here, on April ninth, I went to southern Texas, on the Gulf, and spent there the most painful month of my life - except one, long ago. At its end I was not recognizable." He shuddered.
"I then went to Los Angeles, because a man of importance there considers himself more deeply in my debt even than he is. He is important but not reputable. The terms are not interchangeable."

"It was not. But I was ready to return east, both physically and psychologically, and knowing that inquiries sent to Los Angeles would get a satisfactory response. I arrived on July twelfth. You remember that I once spoke of Arnold Zeck, calling him X, to the Spelling family?"
"I do."
"And I described briefly the echelons of crime. First, the criminal himself - or gang. In the problem of disposal of the loot, or of protection against discovery and prosecution, he can seldom avoid dealing with others. He will need a fence, a lawyer, witnesses for an alibi, a channel to police or political influence - no matter what, he nearly always needs someone or something. He goes to one he knows, or knows about, one named A. A, finding a little difficulty, consults B. B may be able to handle it; if not, he takes it on to C. C is usually able to oblige, but when he isn't he communicates with D. Here we are getting close. D has access to Arnold Zeck, not only for the purpose described, but also in connection with one or more of the enterprises which Zeck controls."
==> Wolfe tapped his chest with a forefinger, a gesture I had never before seen him use, acquired evidently along with his pleats and whiskers. "I am a D, Archie." <==
"Congratulations."
"Thank you. Having earned them, I accept them. Look at me."
"Yeah, I am. Wait till Fritz sees you."
"If he ever does," Wolfe said grimly. "We have a chance, and that's all. If
all we needed were evidence of Zeck's complicity in felonies, there would be no problem; I know where it is and I could get it. But his defenses are everywhere, making him next to invulnerable. It would be fatuous to suppose that he could ever be convicted, and even if he were, he would still be living, so that wouldn't help any. Now that I am committed against him, and he knows it, there are only two possible outcomes - "

He stopped as I grasped the knob and pulled the door open. I had tiptoed across to it as he talked. Seeing an empty hall in both directions, I dosed the door and went back to my chair.
"I was only asking," I protested, "why the play on Rackham?"
"How long," Wolfe asked, "have you and I spent, there in the office, discussing some simple affair such as the forging of a check?"
"Oh, anywhere from four minutes to four hours."

"Nothing - Not a cent."
"You should have. That was put there for the express purpose of financing this eventuality if it arose. You have been using your personal savings?"
"Only to buy these little items." I waved a hand. "Put it back long ago. I've been taking it easy, so my income from detective work has only been a little more than double what you were paying me."

==> Wolfe grunted. "If we get Zeck you may have a month. If he gets me - " <==
He grunted again. "He will, confound it, if we don't get to work. You asked about Rackham; yes, the source of his income, which his wife asked us to discover, was Zeck. He met him through Calvin Leeds."
I raised the brows. "Leeds?"
"Don't jump to conclusions. Leeds sold dogs to Zeck, two of them, to protect his house, and spent a week there, training them for their job. Zeck does not miss an opportunity. He used Rackham in one of his less offensive activities, gambling arrangements for people with too much money. Then when Rackham inherited more than half of his wife's wealth a new situation developed; it was already developing when I arrived six weeks ago. I managed to get informed

 about it. Of course I had to be extremely careful, new as I was, but on the other hand my being a newcomer was an advantage. In preparing a list of prospects for the device I had conceived, a man in Rackham's position was an eminently suitable candidate, and naturally I had to know all about him. That placed me favorably for starting, with the greatest caution, certain speculations and suspicions, and I got it to the point where it seemed desirable to put him under surveillance. Luckily I didn't have to introduce your name; your enlistment had previously been considered, on a suggestion by Max Christy. I was ready for you anyhow - I had gone as far as I could without you - and that made it easier.

I raised the brows. "Leeds?"
"Don't jump to conclusions. Leeds sold dogs to Zeck, two of them, to protect his house, and spent a week there, training them for their job. Zeck does not miss an opportunity. He used Rackham in one of his less offensive activities, gambling arrangements for people with too much money. Then when Rackham inherited more than half of his wife's wealth a new situation developed; it was already developing when I arrived six weeks ago. I managed to get informed

 about it. Of course I had to be extremely careful, new as I was, but on the other hand my being a newcomer was an advantage. In preparing a list of prospects for the device I had conceived, a man in Rackham's position was an eminently suitable candidate, and naturally I had to know all about him. That placed me favorably for starting, with the greatest caution, certain speculations and suspicions, and I got it to the point where it seemed desirable to put him under surveillance. Luckily I didn't have to introduce your name; your enlistment had previously been considered, on a suggestion by Max Christy. I was ready for you anyhow - I had gone as far as I could without you - and that made it easier. I wouldn't have dared to risk naming you myself, and was planning accordingly, but it's vastly better this way."
"Am I to proceed? Get Saul and Orrie and Fred? Tail Rackham?"
==> Wolfe looked at his wrist. His charade was certainly teaching him new tricks. In all my years with him he had never sported a watch, and here he was glancing at his wrist as if born to it. The way that wrist had been, normal, it would have required a custom-made strap. <==
"I told that man an hour or more," he said, "but we shouldn't be that long. A minim of cause for suspicion and I'm through. Nothing is too fantastic for them; they could even learn if we've been using the phone. Confound it, I must have hours with you."
"Ditch him and we'll meet somewhere."
"Impossible. No place would be safe - except one. There is only one circumstance under which any man is granted the right to an extended period of undisturbed privacy, either by deliberation or on impulse. We need a woman. You know all kinds."
"Not all kinds," I objected, "I do draw the line. What kind do we need?"
"Fairly young, attractive, a little wanton in appearance, utterly devoted to you and utterly trustworthy, and not a fool."

"I'll make it a dollar ten an hour. The man will call you Lily, and you will call him Pete. Joining him in the car and riding up to your place, you need not go to extremes, but it is important for the driver to get the idea that you are mighty glad to see Pete and that you are looking forward with pleasure to the next several hours with him. But - "
"Is it a reunion after a long absence?"
"I'll make it a dollar twenty an hour. I was about to say, you can leave it vague whether you last saw Pete a week ago or two months ago. You're just glad to be with him because you're so fond of him, but don't get thinking you're Paulette Goddard and ham it. Do it right. Pretend it's me. Which brings me to the crux. It's going to be an ordeal for you. Wait till you see Pete."
"What's the matter with him?"
"Everything. He's old enough to be your father and then some. He has whiskers, turning gray. His face is pleated. You will have to fight down the feeling that you're having a nightmare, and - "
==> "Archie! It's Nero Wolfe!" <==
Goddam a woman anyhow. There was absolutely no sense or reason for it. My brain buzzed.
"Sure," I said admiringly. "You do it with mirrors. If it was him, the way I feel about him, the first thing I would do would be to get him a date with you, huh? Okay, then don't call him Pete, call him Nero."
"Then who is it?"
"It's a man named Pete Roeder, and I've got to have a long talk with him that won't get in the papers."
"We could take him to Norway."

"No public announcement."
"Certainly not."
"I'm very pleased with your work so far. We'll have to get you a social

 security number. I'll be waiting anxiously at your door."
==> I hung up and told Wolfe, "All set." <==
Out of his chair, he grunted. "You overdid it a little, perhaps? Nightmare, for instance?"
"Yes, sir," I agreed. "I get too enthusiastic." I glared at him, and he glared back.

SINCE I do not intend to use up paper reporting the five-hour conference I had with Wolfe that night in Lily Rowan's living room, I could just as well go on to Wednesday morning, except for one thing. I have got to tell about their arrival

Wolfe didn't speak and wouldn't look at me. Lily shook hands with me, a
form of greeting we hadn't used for I don't know how long, then unlocked the door, and we entered. When her wrap and Wolfe's hat had been disposed of and we passed to the living room, she tossed her firecracker.
"Archie," she said, "I knew darned well that something would happen some day to make up for all the time I've wasted on you, I just felt it would."
I nodded. "Certainly. You'll show a profit on the night even if you feed us sandwiches, especially since Pete is a light eater. He's on a diet."

Wolfe, who had seated himself, cocked his head to frown at her - a first- rate performance.

alone were enough to tell me when I had gone far enough.
"I'll tell you what I'll do," I offered. "I know her quite well. Two things
that could conceivably happen: first, you might go to Zeck tomorrow and tell him who you are, and second. Lily might spill it either thoughtfully or thoughtlessly. I'll bet you ten bucks the first happens as soon as the second."

For now anyway, and then take a good breath. As for commitments, I had one of my own. I had promised myself to see Norway before I died.
So I didn't like it, and I either had to lump it or bow out. I tossed a coin: heads I stick, tails I quit. It landed tails, but I had to veto it because I had already talked to Orrie Gather and he was coming at noon, and I had left messages for Fred Durkin and Saul Panzer. I tossed again, tails again. I tossed once more and it was heads, which settled it. I had to stick.

It was a shame to waste the talents of Saul Panzer on what was actually a burlesque, but it was good to have him around anyhow.

Saul was undersized, inconspicuous all but his nose, and the best all-round man alive. Fred Durkin was big and clumsy, with a big red face, with no Doberman pinscher in him but plenty of bulldog. Orrie Gather was slender and muscular and handsome, just the man to mingle with the guests at a swell dinner party when circumstances called for it. After I had explained the job, with details as required, I supplied a little background.

notice." I pushed my chair back and got up. "And now I wish to prove that being an employer hasn't changed me any. You may continue to call me Archie. You may come with me to Thirty-fifth Street, where we will find a poker deck, and Fritz will make five, and when we have finished I'll lend you carfare home."
For the record, I lost twelve dollars. Saul was the big winner. One hand, I had three nines and - but I'd better get on. Rackham was living at the Churchill, in an air-conditioned suite in the tower. During the first week we compiled quite a biography of him. He never stuck his nose outside before one o'clock, and once not until four. His ports of call included two banks, a law office, nine bars, two clubs, a barber shop, seven other shops and stores, three restaurants, three theaters, two night spots, and miscellaneous. He usually ate lunch with a man or men, and dinner with a woman. Not the same woman; three different ones during the week. As described by my operatives, they were a credit to their sex, to the American way of life, and to the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union.
==> I took on a little of it myself, but mostly I left it to the help. Not that I loafed. There were quite a few hours with Lily Rowan, off and on, both as a substitute for the trip to Norway, indefinitely postponed, and as a check on the soundness of the estimate of her I had given Wolfe. She caused me no qualms. Once when we were dancing she sighed for Pete, and once at her apartment she said she would love to help some more with my work, but when I tactfully made it plain that the detective business was not on our agenda she took it nicely and let it lay. <==
There were other things, including the reports on Rackham to be typed. Late every afternoon Max Christy called at my office to get the report of the day before, and he would sit and read it and ask questions. When he got critical, I would explain patiently that I couldn't very well post a man at the door of Rackham's suite to take pictures of all the comers and goers, and that we were scoring better than eighty per cent on all his hours outside, which was exceptional for New York tailing.
I had the advantage, of course, of having had the situation described to me by their Pete Roeder. They were worried a little about Westchester, but more about the city. Shortly after he had become a millionaire by way of a steak knife, whoever had used it, Rackham had got word to Zeck that he was no longer available for contacts. Brownie Costigan had got to Rackham, thinking to put the

 bee on him, and had been tossed out on his ear. The stink being raised in Washington on gambling and rackets, and the resulting enthusiasm in the office of the New York County District Attorney, had started an epidemic of jitters, and it was quite possible that if one of my typed reports had told of a visit by Rackham to the DA's office, or of one by an assistant DA to Rackham's suite, Rackham would have had a bad accident, like getting run over or falling into the river with lead in him. That was why Wolfe had given me careful and explicit instructions about what I should report and what I shouldn't.
I had no sight or sound of Wolfe. He was to let me know if and when there was something stirring, and I had been told how to reach him if I had to. Meanwhile I had my schedule, and on the ninth day, a Friday, the first of September, it called for a move. Things looked right for it. Saul, on instructions, had let himself get spotted once, and Orrie twice, and Fred, without instructions, at least three times. I too had cooperated by letting myself be seen at the entrance of the Crooked Circle one night as Rackham emerged with companions.

Romance Bar on 49th Street, I went for a walk, found Saul window-shopping, told him to go home to his wife and children, moseyed along to the Romance Bar entrance, and went on in.
Business was rushing, with as many as five at a table the size of a dishpan.
Making no survey, I found a place at the long bar where two customers were carelessly leaving enough room for a guy to get an elbow through, and took the opening. After a while the bartender admitted I was there and let me buy a highball. I took a casual look around, saw Rackham at a table with a pair of males, turned my back that way, and got his range in the mirror.
I did not really expect a bite at the very first try; I thought it might take two or three exposures. But evidently he was ripe. I was in the middle of my second highball when my mirror view showed me the trio getting up and squeezing through the mob to the clear. I dropped my chin and looked at my thumb. They went on by, toward the door, and I turned to watch their manly backs. As soon as they were out I followed, and, on the sidewalk, immediately turned right, thinking to reconnoiter from the shop entrance next door. But I was still two paces from it when there was a voice at my elbow.

"I'm in the market for more. I'll take it all."
I frowned at him. "Now I guess I'll have to do some talking. You
comfortable?" "No."
"Listen anyway. I'm taking Zeck's money and I'm crossing him. How do you know I won't cross you?"
"I don't. But I'll top him."

Zeck can guess and you can guess. Do I make myself clear?"
"I don't know. Are you just warning me not to trust you? Is that it?" "Well, yes."
"Then save your breath. I've never trusted anybody since I started shaving.
As for a nice helping from my pile, that depends. How do you earn it?"

"He may be in a different department from the one you were in. He did name Zeck. He said - "
"He actually named Zeck?"
"Yes."
"To you? That's remarkable. Why?"
"I don't know, but I can guess. I had previously been tapped by Max
==> Christy, some time ago, and I think they've got an idea that I may have it in me to work up to an executive job - now that Nero Wolfe is gone. And they figure I must know that Christy plays with Brownie Costigan, and that Costigan is close to the top, so why not mention Zeck to me to make it glamorous? Anyhow, Roeder did. He said that what they wanted was a tail on you. They wanted it good and tight. They offered extra good pay. I was to use as many men as necessary. I took the job, got the men, and we started a week ago yesterday. Christy comes to my office every day for the reports. You know what's been in them; you know where you've been and what you've done." <==
Rackham was still frowning. "That's all there is to it?"
"That's the job as I took it and as I've handled it."
"You weren't told why?"
"In a way I was. I gathered that they think you might be a bad influence on
the District Attorney, and they want to be sure you don't start associating with him. If you do they would probably make a complaint. I suppose you know what their idea is of making a complaint."

I shook my head. "I can't see it with that background. But listen to this. Roeder came up to my office and stayed an hour, and do you know what he spent most of it doing? Asking me questions about the evening of April eighth! What has that got to do with my handling a tailing job? Nothing!
Why should they be interested in April eighth at all? I think they brought me this job, at double pay, just to start a conversation with me and soften me up. It has already been hinted that Zeck might like to meet me. I think that to frame you for murder they've got to have first-hand dope from someone who was there, and I'm elected. I think they're probably sizing me up, to decide whether I'm qualified to be asked to remember something that happened that night which has

 slipped my mind up to now, at a nice juicy price." I turned my palms up. "It's just a guess."
He still had nothing to say. His blood had apparently eased up a little. He was staring at my face, but I doubted if he was seeing it.
==> "If you care to know why I wanted you to hear it," I went on, "you can have that too. I have my weak spots, and one of them is my professional pride. It got a hard blow when Nero Wolfe scooted instead of staying to fight it out, with your wife's check for ten grand deposited barely in time to get through before she was croaked. If the ten grand is returned to her estate, who gets it? You. And it could be that you killed her. I prefer to leave it where it is and earn it. Among other things, she was killed while I was there, and I helped find the body. That's a fine goddam mess for a good detective, and I was thinking I was one." <==
He found his tongue. "I didn't kill her. I swear to you, Goodwin, I didn't kill her."
"Oh, skip it. Whether you did or didn't, not only do I not want to help frame you, I don't want anyone to frame anybody, not on this one. I've got a personal interest in it. I intend to earn that ten grand, and I don't want Zeck to bitch it up by getting you burned, even if you're the right one, on a fix. Therefore I wanted you to know about this. As I told you, I haven't got it spelled out, it's only a guess with background, and I admit it may be a bum one. What do you think? Am I hearing noises?"
Rackham picked up his drink, which hadn't been touched, took a little sip, about enough for a sparrow, and put it down again. He sat a while, licking his lips. "I don't get you," he said wistfully.
"Then forget it. You're all paid up. I've been known to guess wrong before."
"I don't mean that, I mean you. Why? What's your play?"

"If I get approached."
"You will. That's the way they work. Whatever they offer, I'll top it. Come straight to me and I'll top it. I want to see you anyhow, every day - wait a minute. Come back and sit down. We can make a deal right now, for you to - "
"No," I said, kind but firm. "You're so damn scared it would be a temptation to bargain you out of your last pair of pants. Wait till you cool off a little and get some spunk back. Ring me any time. You understand, of course, we're still tailing you."
I left him.
Several times, walking downtown, I had to rein myself in. I would slow down to a normal gait, and in another block or so there I would be again, pounding along as fast as I could swing it, though all I had ahead was an open evening. I grinned at myself indulgently. I was excited, that was all.
==> The game was on, I had pitched the first ball, and it had cut the inside corner above his knees. Not only that, it was a game with no rules. It was hard to believe that Rackham could possibly go to Zeck or any of his men with it, but if he did I was on a spot hot enough to fry an egg, and Wolfe was as good as gone. That was why I had tried to talk Wolfe out of it. But now that I had started it rolling and there was no more argument, I was merely so excited that I couldn't walk slow if you paid me. <==
I had had it in mind to drop in at Rusterman's Restaurant for dinner and say hello to Marko that evening, but now I didn't feel like sitting through all the motions, so I kept going to Eleventh Avenue, to Mart's Diner, and perched on a stool while I cleaned up a plate of beef stew, three ripe tomatoes sliced by me, and two pieces of blueberry pie. Even with a full stomach I was still excited. It must have shown, I suppose in my eyes, for Mart asked me what the glow was about, and though I had never had any tendency to discuss my business with him, I had to resist an impulse to remark casually that Wolfe and I had finally mixed it up with the most dangerous baby on two legs, one so tough that even Inspector Cramer had said he was out of reach.
I went home and sat in the office all evening, holding magazines open as if I were reading them. All I really did was listen for the phone or doorbell. When the phone rang at ten o'clock and it was only Fred Durkin wanting to know where Saul and the subject were, I was so rude that I hurt his feelings and had to apologize. I told him to cover the Churchill as usual, which was one of the factors that made it a burlesque, since that would have required four men at least. What I wanted to do so bad I could taste if was call the number Wolfe had given

 me, but that had been for emergency only. I looked emergency up in the dictionary, and got "an unforeseen combination of circumstances which calls for immediate action." Since this was just the opposite, a foreseen combination of circumstances which called for getting a good night's sleep, I didn't dial the number. I did get the good night's sleep.
Saturday morning at 1019 I had to pitch another ball, but not to the same batter. The typing of Friday's reports required only the customary summarizing of facts as far as Saul and Fred and Orrie were concerned, but my own share took time and thought. I had to account for the full time I had spent in Rackham's suite, since there was a double risk in it: the chance that I was being checked and had been seen entering and leaving, and the chance that Rackham had himself split a seam. So it was quite a literary effort and I spent three hours on it. That afternoon, when Max Christy called to get the report as usual, and sat to look it over, I had papers on my desk which kept me so busy that I wasn't even aware if he sent me a glance when he got to the middle of the second page, where my personal contribution began. I looked up only when he finally spoke.

The typing of Friday's reports required only the customary summarizing of facts as far as Saul and Fred and Orrie were concerned, but my own share took time and thought. I had to account for the full time I had spent in Rackham's suite, since there was a double risk in it: the chance that I was being checked and had been seen entering and leaving, and the chance that Rackham had himself split a seam. So it was quite a literary effort and I spent three hours on it. That afternoon, when Max Christy called to get the report as usual, and sat to look it over, I had papers on my desk which kept me so busy that I wasn't even aware if he sent me a glance when he got to the middle of the second page, where my personal contribution began. I looked up only when he finally spoke.
"So you had a talk with him, huh?"
I nodded. "Have you read it?"

eleven, and as I understand it you're supposed to get here first. Get started." "Phooey. I'm flattered that you bothered to try it, but - "
"I wouldn't have dreamed of trying it. The company just phoned, and I'm
following instructions. My God, are you conceited!"
"I'll be there in twenty minutes."
It took twenty-two, to her door. She was vindictive enough to insist that
==> there were three television programs she wouldn't miss for anything, which was just as well, considering my disposition. I suppose I might have adjusted to it in time, say ten years, but I was so used to having Wolfe right at hand any minute of the day or night when difficulties were being met that this business of having to sit it out until word came, and then rushing up to a friend's penthouse and waiting another hour and a half, was too much of a strain. <==
He finally arrived. I must admit that when the bell rang Lily, having promised to behave like a lady, did so. She insisted on opening the door for him, but having got him into the living room, she excused herself and left us.
He sat. I stood and looked at him. Eleven days had passed since our reunion, and I hadn't properly remembered how grotesque he was. Except for the eyes, he was no one I had ever seen or cared to see.
"What's the matter?" I asked peevishly. "You look as if you hadn't slept for a week."
"I'm a little tired, that's all," he growled. "I have too much to watch, and

I went ahead to open the door for him. As I did so he asked, "What is this
stuff called?"
"Houri de Perse."
"Great heavens," he muttered, and went.

==> HAVING my own office was giving me a new slant on some of the advantages of the setup I had long enjoyed at Wolfe's place. With a tailing job on, Sunday was like any other day, and I had to be at 1019 at the usual hour, both to type the report and to take calls from the man on the job in case he needed advice or help. It was no longer just burlesque, at least not for me. Even though Rackham knew we were on him, those were three good men, particularly Saul, and I stood a fair chance of being informed if he strayed anywhere out of bounds to keep an appointment. To some extent the tail now served a purpose: to warn me if the subject and the client made a contact, which was somewhat <==

 bassackwards but convenient for me.
After a leisurely Sunday dinner at Rusterman's Restaurant, where I couldn't make up my mind whether Marko Vukcic knew that I had my old job back, I returned to 1019 to find Max Christy waiting at the door. He seemed a little upset. I glanced at my wrist and told him he was early.
"This one-man business is no good," he complained. "You ought to have someone here. I tried to get you on the phone nearly two hours ago."
Unlocking the door and entering, I explained that I had dawdled over tournedos a la Bearnaise, which I thought would impress him. He didn't seem to hear me. When I unlocked a desk drawer to get the report, and handed it to him, he stuffed it in his pocket without glancing at it.

Much as he disliked publicity, his picture had been in the paper a few

 times, as for instance the occasion of his presenting his yacht to the United States Coast Guard during the war. Also I had heard him described. I had a good view of him at ten feet when I sat in one of the pinkish gray leather chairs near his desk. Actually there was nothing to him but his forehead and eyes. It wasn't a forehead, it was a dome, sloping up and up to the line of his faded thin hair. The eyes were the result of an error on the assembly line. They had been intended for a shark and someone got careless.
They did not now look the same as shark eyes because Arnold Zeck's brain had been using them to see with for fifty years, and that had had an effect.
"I've spoken with you on the phone," he said.
==> I nodded. "When I was with Nero Wolfe. Three times altogether - no, I guess it was four." <==
"Four. Where is he? What has happened to him?"
"I'm not sure, but I suspect he's in Florida, training with an air hose, preparing to lay for you in your swimming pool and get you when you dive."
There was no flicker of response, of any kind, in the shark eyes. "I have been told of your habits of speech, Goodwin," he said. "I make no objection. I take men for what they are or not at all. It pleases me that, impressed as you must be by this meeting, you insist on being yourself. But it does waste time and words. Do you know where Wolfe is?"
"No."
"Have you a surmise?"

"Have you a surmise?"
"Yeah, I just told you." I got irritated. "Say I tell you he's in Egypt, where
he owns a house. I don't, but say I do. Then what? You send a punk to Cairo to drill him? Why? Why can't you let him alone? I know he had his faults - God knows how I stood them as long as I did - but he taught me a lot, and wherever he is he's my favorite fatty. Just because he happened to queer your deal with Rackham, you want to track him down. What will that get you, now that he's faded out?"
"I don't wish or intend to track him down."

==> "No? Then what made me so interesting? Your Max Christy and your bearded wonder offering me schoolboy jobs at triple pay. Get me sucked in, get me branded, and when the time comes use me to get at Wolfe so you can pay him. No." I shook my head. "I draw the line somewhere, and all of you together won't get me across that one." <==
I'm not up enough on fish to know whether sharks blink, but Zeck was showing me. He blinked perhaps one-tenth his share. He asked, "Why did you take the job?"
"Because it was Rackham. I'm interested in him. I was glad to know

 someone else was. I would like to have a hand in his future."
No blink. "You think you know, I suppose, the nature of my own interests and activities."

"I know what is said around. I know that a New York police inspector told me that you're out of reach."
"Name him."
"Cramer. Manhattan Homicide."
"Oh, him." Zeck made his first gesture: a forefinger straightened and
curved again. "What was the occasion?"
==> "He wouldn't believe me when I said I didn't know where Wolfe was. He <==
thought Wolfe and I were fixing to try to bring you down, and he was just telling me. I told him that maybe he would like to pull us off because he was personally interested, but that since Wolfe had scooted he was wasting it."
"That was injudicious, wasn't it?"
"All of that. I was in a bad humor."
Zeck blinked; I saw him. "I wanted to meet you, Goodwin. I've allowed
some time for this because I want to look at you and hear you talk. Your idea of my interests and activities probably has some relation to the facts, and if so you may know that my chief problem is men. I could use ten times as many good men as I can find. I judge men partly by their record and partly by report, but mainly by my first-hand appraisal. You have disappointed me in one respect. Your conclusion that I want to use you to find Nero Wolfe is not intelligent. I do not pursue an opponent who has fled the field; it would not be profitable. If be reappears and gets in my path again, I'll crush him. I do want to suck you in, as you put it. I need good men now more than ever. Many people get money from me, indirectly, whom I never see and have no wish to see; but there must be some whom I do see and work through. You might be one. I would like to try. You must know one thing: if you once say yes it becomes impractical to change your mind. It can't be done."

I had once remarked to Wolfe, when X (our name then for Zeck) had
brought a phone call to a sudden end, that he was an abrupt bastard. He now abruptly turned the shark eyes from me, which was a relief, to reach for the switch on an intercom box on his desk, flip it, and speak to it. "Send Roeder in."
"Tell him to shave first," I suggested, thinking that if I had a reputation for a habit of speech I might as well live up to it. Zeck did not react. I was beginning to believe that he never had reacted to anything and never would.

I turned my head enough for the newcomer to have my profile when he entered, not to postpone his pleasure at seeing me.
It was a short wait till the door opened and Roeder appeared. The sentinel did not come in. Roeder crossed to us, stepping fiat on the rugs so as not to slide. His glance at me was fleeting and casual.
"Sit down," Zeck said. "You know Goodwin."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1901    window = 1896 1906

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 35918    window = 35913 35923


"Sit down," Zeck said. "You know Goodwin."
Roeder nodded and favored me with a look. Sitting, he told me, "Your reports haven't been worth what they cost."
It gave me a slight shock, but I don't think I let it show. I had forgotten that Roeder talked through his nose.
"Sorry," I said condescendingly. "I've been sticking to facts. If you want them dressed up, let me know what color you like."
"You've been losing him."
==> I flared up quietly. "I used to think," I said, "that Nero Wolfe expected too much. But even he had brains enough to know that hotels have more than one exit." <==
"You're being paid enough to cover the exits to the Yankee Stadium." Zeck said, in his hard, cold, precise voice that never went up or down, "These are trivialities. I've had a talk with Goodwin, Roeder, and I sent for
you because we got to Rackham. We have to decide how it is to be handled and what part Goodwin is to play. I want your opinion on the effect of Goodwin's telling Rackham that he is working for Mrs. Frey."
Roeder shrugged. "I think it's unimportant. Goodwin's main purpose now is to get Rackham scared. We've got to have him scared good before we can expect him to go along with us. If he killed his wife - "
"He did, of course. Unquestionably."
"Then he might be more afraid of Mrs. Frey than of you. We can see. It not, it will be simple for Goodwin to give him a new line." Roeder looked at me. "It's all open for you to Rackham now?"

The shark eyes left me. "What's your opinion of Goodwin, Roeder? Can you work with him?"
Roeder had closed the brief case and kept it on his lap. "I can try," he said, not enthusiastically. "The general level here is no higher than on the coast. But we can't get started until we know whether we have Rackham or not, and the approach through Goodwin does seem the best way. He's so damned cocky I don't know whether he'll take direction."
"Would you care to have my opinion of Roeder?" I inquired.
Zeck ignored it. "Goodwin," he said, "this is the most invulnerable organization on earth. There are good men in it, but it all comes to me. I am the organization. I have no prejudices and no emotions. You will get what you deserve. If you deserve well, there is no limit to the support you will get, and none to the reward. If you deserve ill, there is no limit to that either. You understand that?"
"Sure." His eyes were the hardest to meet in my memory. "Provided you understand that I don't like you."
==> "No one likes me. No one likes the authority of superior intellect. There was one man who matched me in intellect - the man you worked for, Nero Wolfe - but his will failed him. His vanity wouldn't let him yield, and he cleared out." <==
"He was a little handicapped," I protested, "by his respect for law."
"Every man is handicapped by his own weaknesses. If you communicate with him give him my regards. I have great admiration for him."
Zeck glanced at a clock on the wall and then at Roeder. "I'm keeping a caller waiting. Goodwin is under your direction, but he is on trial. Consult me as necessary within the routine."
He must have had floor buttons for foot-signaling, for he touched nothing with his hands, but the door opened and the sentinel appeared.
Zeck said, "Put Goodwin on the B list, Schwartz."

THERE was one chore Wolfe had given me which I haven't mentioned, because I didn't care to reveal the details - and still don't. But the time will come when you will want to know where the gun at the bottom of the brief case came from, so I may as well say now that you aren't going to know.
Since filing the number from a gun has been made obsolete by the progress of science, the process of getting one that can't be traced has got more complicated and requires a little specialized knowledge. One has to be acquainted with the right people. I am. But there is no reason why you should be, so I won't give their names and addresses. I couldn't quite meet Wolfe's specifications - the size and weight of a .22 and the punch of a .45 - but I did pretty well; a Carson Snub Thirty, an ugly little devil, but straight and powerful.
I tried it out one evening in the basement at 35th Street. When I was through I collected the bullets and dumped them in the river. We were taking enough chances without adding another, however slim.

The next evening after our conference with Zeck, a Monday, Wolfe and I collaborated on the false bottom for the brief case. We did the job at 1019. Since I was now a B and Roeder's lieutenant on his big operation, and he was supposed
to keep in touch with me, there was no reason why he shouldn't come to 35th Street for an evening visit, but when I suggested it he compressed his lips and scowled at me with such ferocity that I quickly changed the subject. We made the false bottom out of an old piece of leather that I picked up at a shoe hospital, and it wasn't bad at all. Even if a sentinel removed all the papers for a close inspection, which wasn't likely with the status Roeder had reached, there was little chance of his suspecting the bottom; yet if you knew just where and how to pry you could have the Carson out before you could say Jackie Robinson.
However, something had happened before that: my second talk with Barry Rackham. When I got home late Sunday night the phone-answering service reported that he had been trying to reach me, both at 1019 and at the office, and I gave him a ring and made a date for Monday at three o'clock.

Even if a sentinel removed all the papers for a close inspection, which wasn't likely with the status Roeder had reached, there was little chance of his suspecting the bottom; yet if you knew just where and how to pry you could have the Carson out before you could say Jackie Robinson.
However, something had happened before that: my second talk with Barry Rackham. When I got home late Sunday night the phone-answering service reported that he had been trying to reach me, both at 1019 and at the office, and I gave him a ring and made a date for Monday at three o'clock.
Usually I am on the dot for an appointment, but that day an errand took less time than I had allowed, and it was only twelve to three when I left the Churchill tower elevator at Rackham's floor and walked to his door. I was lifting my hand to push the button, when the door opened and I had to step back so a woman wouldn't walk into me. When she saw me she stopped, and we both stared. It was Lina Darrow. Her fine eyes were as fine as ever.

THERE was one chore Wolfe had given me which I haven't mentioned, because I didn't care to reveal the details - and still don't. But the time will come when you will want to know where the gun at the bottom of the brief case came from, so I may as well say now that you aren't going to know.
Since filing the number from a gun has been made obsolete by the progress of science, the process of getting one that can't be traced has got more complicated and requires a little specialized knowledge. One has to be acquainted with the right people. I am. But there is no reason why you should be, so I won't give their names and addresses. I couldn't quite meet Wolfe's specifications - the size and weight of a .22 and the punch of a .45 - but I did pretty well; a Carson Snub Thirty, an ugly little devil, but straight and powerful.
I tried it out one evening in the basement at 35th Street. When I was through I collected the bullets and dumped them in the river. We were taking enough chances without adding another, however slim.
==> The next evening after our conference with Zeck, a Monday, Wolfe and I collaborated on the false bottom for the brief case. We did the job at 1019. Since I was now a B and Roeder's lieutenant on his big operation, and he was supposed <==
to keep in touch with me, there was no reason why he shouldn't come to 35th Street for an evening visit, but when I suggested it he compressed his lips and scowled at me with such ferocity that I quickly changed the subject. We made the false bottom out of an old piece of leather that I picked up at a shoe hospital, and it wasn't bad at all. Even if a sentinel removed all the papers for a close inspection, which wasn't likely with the status Roeder had reached, there was little chance of his suspecting the bottom; yet if you knew just where and how to pry you could have the Carson out before you could say Jackie Robinson.

"Get it over with! Would you rather keep on listening for the phone and the doorbell? Get it over with!"
He reached for his straight drink, which he hadn't touched, swallowed it at a gulp, shuddered all over, and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
"I'll ring you around noon to confirm it," I said, and stood up to go. He didn't come with me to the door, but under the circumstances I didn't hold it against him.


==> So that evening when Wolfe came to 1019 it appeared to be high time for <==
getting the false bottom in the brief case ready, and we went on until midnight, discussing the program from every angle and trying to cover every contingency. It's always worth trying, though it can never be done, especially not with a layout as tricky as that one.
Then the next morning, Tuesday, a monkey wrench, thrown all the way from White Plains, flew into the machinery and stopped it. I had just finished breakfast, with Fritz, when the phone rang and I went to the office to get it. It was the Westchester DA's office. The talk was brief. When I had hung up I sat a while, glaring at the phone, then with an exasperated finger dialed the Churchill's number. That talk was brief too. Finished with it, I held the button down for a moment and dialed another number. There had been only two buzzes when a voice came through a nose to me.
"Yes?"
"I'd like to speak to Mr. Roeder ."
"Talking."

Satisfied, she released it. "Barry and I had been friendly, a little, before Mrs. Rackham's death. Nothing but just a little friendly. That's all it meant to me, or I thought it was, and I thought it was the same with him. That's how it was when we went to the country for the Easter weekend. She had told me we wouldn't do any work there, answer any mail or anything, but Saturday at noon she sent for me to come to her room. She was crying and was so distressed she could hardly talk."
Lina paused. She was keeping her eyes straight at mine. "I can rattle this off now, Mr. Goodwin. I've already told it now."
"That always makes it easier," I agreed. "Go right ahead."
She did. "Mrs. Rackham said she had to talk about it with someone, and she wanted to with her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Frey, but she just couldn't, so there

==>  was only me. She said she had gone to see Nero Wolfe the day before, to ask him to find out where her husband was getting money from, and he had agreed to do it. Mr. Wolfe had phoned her that evening. Friday evening, and told her that he had already partly succeeded. He had learned that her husband was connected with something that was criminal. He was helping somebody with things that were against the law, and he was getting well paid for it. Mr. Wolfe advised her to keep it to herself until he had more details. He said his assistant, Mr. Goodwin, would come up Saturday afternoon, and might have more to report then." <==
"And that Goodwin knew all about it?" Archer asked.
"Well, naturally she took that for granted. She didn't say that Mr. Wolfe told her in so many words that Mr. Goodwin knew all about it, but if he was his assistant and helping with it, naturally she would think so. Anyway that didn't seem to be important then, because she had told it all to her husband. They used the same bedroom at Birchvale, and she said that after they had gone to bed she simply couldn't help it. She didn't tell me their conversation, what they said to each other, but they had had a violent quarrel. She had told him they would have to separate, she was through with him, and she would have Mr. Wolfe go on with his investigation and get proof of what he had done. Mrs. Rackham had a very strong character, and she hated to be deceived. But the next day she wasn't sure she really meant it, that she really wanted to part from him. That was why she wanted to talk about it with someone. I think the reason she didn't want to talk with Mrs. Frey - "
"If you don't mind, Miss Darrow," Archer suggested gently, "just the facts now."
"Yes, of course." She sent him a glance and returned to me. "I told her I thought she was completely wrong. I said that if her husband had been untrue to her, or anything like that, that would be different, but after all he hadn't done wrong to her, only to other people and himself, and that she should try to help him instead of destroying him. At the very least, I said, she should wait until she knew all the details of what he had done. I think that was what she wanted to hear, but she didn't say so. She was very stubborn. Then, that afternoon, I did something that I will regret all my life. I went to Barry and told him she had told me about it, and said I was sure it would come out all right if he would meet her halfway - tell her the whole thing, tell her he was sorry, as he certainly should be - and no more foolishness in the future. And Barry said he loved me."
She weakened a little there for the first time. She dropped her eyes. I had been boring at her with as steady and sharp a gaze as I had in me, but up to that point she had met it full and fair.

"Why not?"
"Because I didn't think it would be fair to Barry. I didn't think he had killed her, and I didn't know what criminal things he had helped with, and I thought it wouldn't be fair to tell that about him when all I knew was what Mrs. Rackham had told me." The fine eyes flashed for the first time. "Oh, I know the next part. Then why am I telling it now? Because I know more about him now - a great deal more! I don't know that he killed Mrs. Rackham, but I know he could have; he is cruel and selfish and unscrupulous - there is nothing he wouldn't do. I suppose you think I'm vindictive, and maybe I am, but it doesn't matter what you think about me as long as I'm telling the truth. What the criminal things were that he did, and whether he killed his wife - I don't know anything about it; that's your part."
"Not mine, sister. I'm not a cop."
She turned to the others. "Yours, then!"
This would have been a good moment for me to take time out to read my

About all that Barry Rackham's ticket to the electric chair needed was my endorsement, and I thought he had it coming to him. All I had to do was tell the truth. I could say that I had no knowledge whatever of the phone call Nero Wolfe was purported to have made to Mrs. Rackham, but that it was conceivable that he had made such a call without mentioning it to me, since he had often withheld information from me regarding his actions and intentions. You couldn't beat that for truth. In various occasions I had used all my wits to help pin it on a murderer, and here it would take no wit at all, merely tossing in a couple of facts. But if I let it go at that, it was a cinch that before the sun went down Rackham would be locked up, and that would ruin everything. The program sunk, the months all wasted, the one <==

 chance gone, Zeck sailing on with the authority of his superior intellect, and Wolfe and me high and dry. My wits had a new job, and quick. I liked to think that they had done their share once or twice in getting a murderer corralled; now it was up to them to do more than their share in keeping a murderer running loose and free to keep appointments. Truth was not enough. There was no time to draw a sketch and see how I liked it. All three of them were looking at me, and Archer was saying, "You can see, Goodwin, why I wanted you to read your statement and see if you left anything out."
"Yeah." I was regretful. "I can also see you holding your breath, and I don't blame you. If I now say that's right, I forgot, Wolfe did phone Mrs. Rackham that Friday evening and tell her that, you've got all you need and hallelujah - I would love to help out, but I like to stick to the truth as far as practical."
"The truth is all I'm asking for. Did you call on Rackham at his apartment yesterday afternoon?"
That punch had of course been telegraphed. "Yes," I said.

"Uh-huh. When the blowup came yesterday, did you threaten to tell what you knew?"
"Yes."
I goggled at her. "You know, sister," I declared, "you should have spent more time thinking this through. You are unquestionably the bummest liar I have ever run across. I thought maybe - "
Dykes broke in. "She says Rackham probably figured he wasn't in much danger, so many months had passed."
"Yeah? That's partly what I mean. Whatever she says, what about Rackham? He's not boob enough to figure like that. He would know damn well that five months is nothing in the life of a murder. He has his choice between marrying this attractive specimen or having her run to you with the ink for his death warrant, and not only does he act heartless and cruel, he actually opens the door for her to go! This guy who had it in him to sneak into the woods at night with a knife to stab his wife to death and a fighting dog - he just opens the door for this poor pretty creature to tell the world about it! My God, you would buy that?"
==> "You can't tell about people," Archer said. "And she has details. Take the detail of the phone call Wolfe made to Mrs. Rackham and what he told her about her husband. Not even a good liar would have that detail, let alone a bum one." <==
"Nuts." I was disgusted. "No such phone call was made, and Mrs. Rackham never said it was. As for Rackham's having been in with crooks, either he wasn't and sister here invented it, in which case you'd better watch your step, or he was, and sister here got his tongue loosened enough for him to tell her about it. I'm perfectly willing to believe she is capable of that, however bum a liar she may be."
"You say Wolfe didn't make that call to Mrs. Rackham?"
"Yes."
"And he didn't learn that Rackham's income came from a connection with
criminal activities?"

If it had been the way you say, what would Wolfe and I have done after I phoned him that night and told him Mrs. Rackham had got it? Our only interest was the fee she had paid us. Why didn't we just hand it all to the cops? Another little feature, do you remember that gathering that evening? Did either Rackham or his wife act like people who were riding the kind of storm you describe? Don't ask me, I could be prejudiced; ask all the others." <==
I left her for Archer. "I could go on for an hour, but don't tell me you need it. I don't wonder you grabbed at it, it looked as if it might possibly be the break you had been hoping for, and besides, she had fixed it up with some trimmings that might be very juicy, like the crap about me working for Rackham. I have not and am not, and I have none of his dough. Must I punch more holes in it?"
Archer was studying me. "Is it your contention that Miss Darrow invented all this?"
"It is."
"Why?"
I shrugged. "I don't know. Do you want me to guess?"

"His pulse is all right," Roeder said, not through his nose.
"You're crazy," Rackham said hoarsely. "Good God! You're crazy!" He was out of his chair, standing there in front of it, trembling all over.
Roeder 's hand went to his side pocket for the Carson Snub Thirty, which he had got from the brief case along with the piece of cord. I took it and aimed it at Rackham.
"Sit down." I said. "and stay."
He sank down into the chair. I moved to the end of the desk so as to have him in a corner of my eye while looking at Zeck. Roeder, at my left elbow, spoke rapidly but distinctly.
==> "Mr. Zeck," he said, "you told me on the telephone two years ago that you had great admiration for me. I hope that what has just happened here has increased it. I'm Nero Wolfe, of course. There are many things it would give me satisfaction to say to you, and perhaps I shall some day, but not now. It is true that if one of your men suddenly opened the door Mr. Goodwin would kill you first, but I'm afraid you'd have company. So I'll get on. Having by your admission matched you in intellect, it's a question of will, and mine has not failed me, as you thought. Confound it, I wish you could speak." <==
The expression of Zeck's eyes, no longer popping, indicated that Wolfe had nothing on him there.
"Here's the situation," Wolfe went on. "During the two months I've been here in this outlandish guise I have collected enough evidence to get you charged on thirty counts under Federal law. I assure you that the evidence is sound and sufficient, and is in the hands of a man whom you cannot stop or deflect. You'll have to take my word for it that if that evidence is produced and used you are done for, and that it will be immediately produced and used if anything untoward happens to Mr. Goodwin or me. I fancy you will take my word since you admit that I match you in intellect, and to climax these five frightful months with such a bluff as this, if it were one, would be witless. However, if you think I'm bluffing there's no point in going on. If you think I'm bluffing, please shake your head no, meaning you don't believe me."
No shake.
"If you think I have the evidence as described, please nod your head."
No nod.

"Here's the situation," Wolfe went on. "During the two months I've been here in this outlandish guise I have collected enough evidence to get you charged on thirty counts under Federal law. I assure you that the evidence is sound and sufficient, and is in the hands of a man whom you cannot stop or deflect. You'll have to take my word for it that if that evidence is produced and used you are done for, and that it will be immediately produced and used if anything untoward happens to Mr. Goodwin or me. I fancy you will take my word since you admit that I match you in intellect, and to climax these five frightful months with such a bluff as this, if it were one, would be witless.

No shake.

No nod.

Roeder 's hand went to his side pocket for the Carson Snub Thirty, which he had got from the brief case along with the piece of cord. I took it and aimed it at Rackham.
"Sit down." I said. "and stay."
He sank down into the chair. I moved to the end of the desk so as to have him in a corner of my eye while looking at Zeck. Roeder, at my left elbow, spoke rapidly but distinctly.
"Mr. Zeck," he said, "you told me on the telephone two years ago that you had great admiration for me. I hope that what has just happened here has increased it. I'm Nero Wolfe, of course. There are many things it would give me satisfaction to say to you, and perhaps I shall some day, but not now.

Zeck nodded. Nothing violent, but a nod. "You assume my possession of the evidence?" Zeck nodded again.


"Good. Then we can bargain. While I have great respect for the Federal laws, I am under no obligation to catch violators of them. Without compunction I can leave that to others. But I am under an obligation to a certain individual which I feel strongly and which I must discharge. Mrs. Rackham paid me a large sum to serve her interest, and the next day she was murdered. It was clearly my duty to expose her murderer - not only my duty to her but to my own self-respect - and I have failed. With an obligation of that nature I have never accepted failure and do not intend to. Mr. Goodwin, working in my behalf, has been a party to that failure, and he too will not accept it."

Zeck nodded again, or I thought he did, probably to signify approval of our high moral standards.
==> "So we can bargain," Wolfe told him. "You said day before yesterday that you have evidence, or can easily get it, that will convict Rackham of the murder of his wife. Was that true?" <==
Zeck nodded. The shark eyes were intent on Wolfe.
"Very well. I believe you because I know what you are capable of. I offer a trade. I'll trade you the evidence I have collected against you for the evidence that will convict Rackham. Will you make the trade?"
Zeck nodded.
"It will have to be more or less on my terms. I can be trusted; you cannot. You will have to deliver first. But I realize that the details of anything as vital as this is to you cannot be settled without discussion, and it must be discussed and settled now. We are going to release your hands and take that handkerchief from your mouth, but before we do so, one more warning. You are to stay where you are until we're finished. If you move toward the floor signals under your desk, or try to summon your men in any other manner, you will die before anyone else does. Also, of course, there is the evidence that exists against you. You understand the situation?"

Needing two hands to untie the cord, I put the Carson Snub Thirty down
on the polished top of Zeck's desk. I would have given a year's pay for a glance at Rackham, to see what the chances were, but that might have ruined it. So I put the gun there, stepped around to the rear of Zeck's chair, knelt, and started untying the knot. My heart was pounding my ribs like a sledgehammer.
So I didn't see it happen; I could only hear it. I did see one thing there behind Zeck's chair: a sudden convulsive jerk of his arms, which must have been

 his reaction to the sight of Rackham jumping for the gun I had left on the desk. More even than a sight of Rackham, to see if he was rising to it, I wanted a sight of Wolfe, to see if he was keeping his promise to duck for cover the instant Rackham started for the gun, but I couldn't afford it.

My one desperate job now was to get that cord off of Zeck's wrists in time, and while Wolfe had used the trick knot we had practiced with, he had made it damn tight. I barely had it free and was unwinding the cord from the wrists when the sound of the shot came, followed immediately by another.
As I got the cord off and jammed it in my pocket, Zeck's torso slumped sideways and then forward. Flat on the floor, I slewed around, saw Zeck's contorted face right above my eyes, pulled the handkerchief out of his mouth and stuffed it in my pocket with the cord, slid forward under the desk, and reached for one of the signal buttons.
I didn't know, and don't know yet, whether the noise of the shots had got through the soundproof door or whether it was my push on the button that brought them. I didn't hear the door open, but the next shots I heard were a fusillade that came from no Carson, so I came back out from under the desk and on up to my feet. Schwartz and his buddy were standing just inside the door, one with two guns and one with one. Rackham was stretched out on the floor, flat on his face. Wolfe was standing at the end of the desk, facing the door, scowling as I had never seen him scowl before.
"The dirty bastard," I said bitterly, and I admit my voice might have trembled even if I hadn't told it to.
"Reach up," Schwartz said, advancing.

Harry wheeled, pushed the door open, and was gone too.

"Now? For God's sake, now?"
"Yes. Now. A man has a right to have his satisfactions match his pains. I

"No, confound it," he said peevishly. "I still have to earn that fee."
It was six o'clock, and he had come down from the plant rooms with some more pointed remarks about the treatment the plants had got at Hewitt's place. The remarks were completely uncalled for. Considering the two journeys they had taken, out to Long Island and then hack again, the plants were in splendid shape, especially those hard to handle like the Miltonias and Phalaenopsis. Wolfe was merely trying to sell the idea, at least to himself, that the orchids had missed him.
Fritz might have been a mother whose lost little boy has been brought home after wandering in the desert for days, living on cactus pulp and lizards' tails. Wolfe had gained not an ounce less than ten pounds in seventy-two hours, in spite of all the activity of getting resettled, and at the rate he was going he would be back to normal long before Thanksgiving.
The pleats in his face were already showing a tendency to spread out, and of course the beard was gone, and the slick had been shampooed out of his hair. I had tried to persuade him to stay in training, but he wouldn't even bother to put up an argument. He just spent more time than ever with Fritz, arranging about meals.
He had not got home for dinner Tuesday evening after all, in spite of the satisfaction he had got by putting in a call to Fritz on Zeck's phone. We were now cleaned up with Westchester, but it had not been simple. The death of Arnold Zeck had of course started a chain reaction that went both deep and wide, and naturally there had been an earnest desire to make goats out of Wolfe and me, but they didn't have a damn thing on us, and when word came from

As for the scene that ended with the death of Zeck and Rackham, we were clean as a whistle. The papers in Roeder's brief case, which of course the cops took, proved nothing on anybody. By the time the cops arrived there had been no one on the premises but Wolfe and me and the two corpses. A hot search was on, especially for Schwartz and Harry, but so far no take. No elaborate lying was required; our basic story was that Wolfe, in his disguise as Roeder, had got in with Zeck in order to solve the murder of Mrs. Rackham, and the climax had come that afternoon when Zeck had put the screws on Rackham by saying that he had evidence that would convict him for killing his wife, and Rackham had pulled a gun, smuggled somehow past the sentinels, and had shot Zeck, and Schwartz and Harry had rushed in and drilled Rackham. It was surprising and gratifying to note how much of it was strictly true.

I had tried to persuade him to stay in training, but he wouldn't even bother to put up an argument. He just spent more time than ever with Fritz, arranging about meals.

We were now cleaned up with Westchester, but it had not been simple.

 somewhere that Wolfe, during his association with Zeck, might have collected some facts that could be embarrassing to people who shouldn't be embarrassed, the attitude toward us changed for the better right away.
As for the scene that ended with the death of Zeck and Rackham, we were clean as a whistle. The papers in Roeder's brief case, which of course the cops took, proved nothing on anybody. By the time the cops arrived there had been no one on the premises but Wolfe and me and the two corpses. A hot search was on, especially for Schwartz and Harry, but so far no take. No elaborate lying was required; our basic story was that Wolfe, in his disguise as Roeder, had got in with Zeck in order to solve the murder of Mrs. Rackham, and the climax had come that afternoon when Zeck had put the screws on Rackham by saying that he had evidence that would convict him for killing his wife, and Rackham had pulled a gun, smuggled somehow past the sentinels, and had shot Zeck, and Schwartz and Harry had rushed in and drilled Rackham. It was surprising and gratifying to note how much of it was strictly true.
So by Friday afternoon we were cleaned up with Westchester, as I thought, and therefore it was a minor shock when Wolfe said, "No, confound it, I still have to earn that fee."
I was opening my mouth to ask him how come, when the phone rang.

It was six o'clock, and he had come down from the plant rooms with some more pointed remarks about the treatment the plants had got at Hewitt's place. The remarks were completely uncalled for. Considering the two journeys they had taken, out to Long Island and then hack again, the plants were in splendid shape, especially those hard to handle like the Miltonias and Phalaenopsis. Wolfe was merely trying to sell the idea, at least to himself, that the orchids had missed him.

"Yes, Mrs. Frey? This is Nero Wolfe."

about earning that fee? Maybe?"
He grunted, irritated that he had to interrupt his convalescence for a job of
work, sat a moment, reached for a bottle of the beer Fritz had brought, grunted again, this time with satisfaction, and poured a glass with plenty of foam.
I got up to go to the kitchen, to tell Fritz we were having company and that refreshments might be required.

==> I WAS mildly interested when the six guests arrived - a little early, five to nine - in such minor issues as the present state of relations between Annabel Frey and the banker, Dana Hammond, and between Lina Darrow and the statesman, Oliver Pierce, and whether Calvin Leeds would see fit to apologize for his unjust suspicions about Wolfe and me. <==
To take the last first, Leeds was all out of apologies. The spring was in his step all right, but not in his manners. First to enter the office, he plumped himself down in the red leather chair, but I figured that Archer rated it ex officio and asked him to move, which he did without grace. As for the others, there was too much atmosphere to get any clear idea. They were all on speaking terms, but the problem that brought them there was in the front of their minds, so much so that no one was interested in the array of liquids and accessories that Fritz and I had arranged on the table over by the big globe. Annabel was in the most comfortable of the yellow chairs, to Archer's left; then, working toward me at my desk, Leeds and Lina Darrow; and Hammond and Pierce closest to me.
Wolfe's eyes swept the arc.
"This," he said, "is a little awkward for me. I have met none of you before

 except Mr. Leeds. I must be sure I have you straight." His eyes went along the line again. "I think I have. Now if you'll tell me what you want - you, Mrs. Frey, it was you who phoned me."

is that it seems to be supposed that Barry Rackham killed his wife, but it hasn't been proven, and now that he is dead how can it be proven so that everyone will know it and the rest of us will be entirely free of any suspicion? Mr. Archer says there is no official suspicion of us, but that isn't enough."
"It is gratifying, though," Wolfe murmured.
"Yes, but it isn't gratifying to have some of the people who say they are your friends looking at you as they do." Annabel was earnest about it. "Then the second problem is this. The law will not allow a man who commits a murder to profit by it. If Barry Rackham killed his wife he can't inherit property from her, no matter what her will said. But it has to be legally proven that he killed her, and unless that is done her will stands, and what she left to him will go to his heirs."
She made a gesture. "It isn't that we want it - the rest of us. It can go to the state or to charity - we don't care. But we think it's wrong and a shame for it to go to his people, whoever will inherit from him. It's not only immoral, it's illegal. It can't be stopped by convicting him of murder, because he's dead and can't be tried. My lawyer and Mr. Archer both say we can bring action and get it before a court, but then we'll have to have evidence that he killed her, and Mr. Archer says he hasn't been able to get it from you, and he hasn't got it. But surely you can get it, or anyhow you can try. You see, that would solve both problems, to have a court rule that his heirs can't inherit because he murdered her."
"You have stated it admirably," Archer declared.

And not only my capacities, but the circumstances themselves, restrict me to a much more modest ambition. I can get you one of the things you want, removal of all suspicion from the innocent, but the other, having Mrs. Rackham's bequest to her husband set aside, is beyond me."
They all frowned at him, in their various fashions. Hammond, the banker, protested, "That doesn't seem to make sense. What accomplishes one accomplishes the other. If you prove that Rackham killed his wife - "

done. It is true that Rackham deserved to die, and as a murderer. He killed a woman here in New York three years ago, a woman named Delia Montrose - one of Mr. Cramer's unsolved cases; Rackham ran his car over her. That was how Zeck originally got a noose on Rackham, by threatening to expose him for the murder he did commit. As you know, Mr. Archer, I penetrated some distance - not very far, but far enough - into Zeck's confidence, and I learned a good deal about his methods. I doubt if he ever had conclusive evidence that Rackham bad killed Delia Montrose, but Rackham, conscious of his guilt, hadn't the spine to demand a showdown. Murderers seldom have. Then Rackham got a spine, suddenly and fortuitously, by becoming a millionaire; he thought then he could fight it; he defied Zeck; and Zeck, taking his time, retorted by threatening to expose Rackham for the murder of his wife. The threat was dangerous and effective even without authentic evidence to support it; there could of course be no authentic evidence that Rackham killed his wife, because he didn't."
They all froze, still wearing the frowns. Knowing Wolfe as I did, I had suspected that was coming, so I was taking them all in to get the impact, but there wasn't much to choose.

All but Archer's. "You have signed a statement," he told Wolfe, "to the effect that Zeck told Rackham he could produce evidence that would convict him of murder, and that Rackham thereupon shot Zeck. Now you say, in contradiction - "
"There is no contradiction," Wolfe declared. "The fact of Rackham's innocence would have been no defense against evidence manufactured by Zeck, and Rackham knew it. Innocent as he was - of this murder, that is - he knew what Zeck was capable of."
"You have said that you think Rackham killed his wife, but that you have no proof."

They all frowned at him, in their various fashions. Hammond, the banker, protested, "That doesn't seem to make sense. What accomplishes one accomplishes the other. If you prove that Rackham killed his wife - "


"But I can't prove that." Wolfe shook his head. "I'm sorry, but it can't be
done. It is true that Rackham deserved to die, and as a murderer. He killed a woman here in New York three years ago, a woman named Delia Montrose - one of Mr. Cramer's unsolved cases; Rackham ran his car over her. That was how Zeck originally got a noose on Rackham, by threatening to expose him for the murder he did commit. As you know, Mr. Archer, I penetrated some distance - not very far, but far enough - into Zeck's confidence, and I learned a good deal about his methods. I doubt if he ever had conclusive evidence that Rackham bad killed Delia Montrose, but Rackham, conscious of his guilt, hadn't the spine to demand a showdown. Murderers seldom have. Then Rackham got a spine, suddenly and fortuitously, by becoming a millionaire; he thought then he could fight it; he defied Zeck; and Zeck, taking his time, retorted by threatening to expose Rackham for the murder of his wife. The threat was dangerous and effective even without authentic evidence to support it; there could of course be no authentic evidence that Rackham killed his wife, because he didn't."

"I don't want to leave. I want a talk with you. If you knew, that night, who had killed Mrs. Rackham, I intend to - "
"It is," Wolfe said cuttingly, "of no importance what you intend. You have had five months to implement your intentions, and where are you? I admit that up to three days ago I had one big advantage over you, but not since then - not since I told you of the package I got with a cylinder of tear gas in it, and of the phone call from Mr. Zeck.

How had he learned about it? Apparently he even knew the amount of the check she had given me. How? From whom?"
I was not really itching to shoot anybody. So I got up and unobtrusively moved around back of them, to the rear of the chair that was occupied by Calvin Leeds. Wolfe was proceeding.

"Good," Wolfe said approvingly. "You're already drawing up your lines of defense. You'll need them."
"What you're doing," Leeds said, still too loud, "if I understand you - you're intimating that I told Zeck about my cousin's coming here and hiring you. You're intimating that in front of witnesses."
==> "That's right," Wolfe agreed. "But it's not vital to me; I mention it chiefly to explain why I suspected you of duplicity, and of being involved in some way <==

 with Arnold Zeck even before Mr. Goodwin left here that day to go up there. It draws attention to you, no doubt of that; but it is not primary evidence that you murdered your cousin. The proof that it was you who killed her was given to me on the phone that night by Mr. Goodwin."
There were stirrings and little noises. Leeds ignored them.
"So," he said, not so loud now, "you're actually accusing me before witnesses of murdering my cousin?"
"I'm accusing you of that, yes, sir, but also I'm accusing you of something much worse than that." Wolfe spat it at him. "I'm accusing you of deliberately and ruthlessly, to protect yourself from the consequences of your murder of your cousin for the money you would inherit from her, thrusting that knife into the belly of a dog that loved you and trusted you!"

Leeds started up, but hadn't got far when my hands were on his shoulders, and with plenty of pressure. He let down. I moved my hands to the back of his chair.
Wolfe's voice was cold and cutting. "No one could have done that but you, Mr. Leeds. In the woods at night, that trained dog would not have gone far from its mistress. Someone else might possibly have killed the dog first and then her, but it wasn't done that way, because the knife was left in the dog. And if someone else, permitted to get close to her, had succeeded in killing her with a sudden savage thrust and then defended himself against the dog's attack, it is not believable that he could have stopped so ferocious a beast by burying the knife in its side without himself getting a single tooth-mark on him. You know those dogs; you wouldn't believe it; neither will I.
"No, Mr. Leeds, it could have been only you. When Mr. Goodwin went on to your house and you stayed out at the kennels, you joined your cousin on her walk in the woods. I doubt if the dog would have permitted even you to stab her to death in its presence; I don't know; but you didn't have to. You sent the dog away momentarily, and, when the knife had done its work on your cousin, you withdrew it, stood there in the dark with the knife in your hand, and called the dog to come. It came, and despite the smell of fresh blood, it behaved itself because it loved and trusted you. You could have spared it; you could have taken it home with you; but no. That would have put you in danger. It had to die for you, and by your hand."
Wolfe took a breath. "To this point I know I am right; now conjecture enters. You stabbed the dog, of course, burying the blade in its belly, but did you leave the knife there intentionally, to prevent a gush of blood on you, or did the animal convulsively leap from you at the feel of the prick, jerking the knife from your grasp? However that may be, all you could do was make for home, losing

You pretended sleep, of course, when he came for you."
Leeds was keeping his head up, but I could see his hands gripping his legs just above the knees.

"You used that dog," Wolfe went on, his voice as icy as Arnold Zeck's had ever been, "even after it died. You were remorseless to your dead friend.

It had not come to your doorstep to die, Mr. Leeds, and you knew it; it had come there to try to get at you. It wanted to sink its teeth in you just once. I say you knew it, because when you squatted beside the dog and put your hand on it, it snarled. It would not have snarled if it had felt your hand as the soothing and sympathetic touch of a trusted friend in its last agony; indeed not; it snarled because it knew you, at the end, to be unworthy of its love and trust, and it scorned and hated you. That snarl alone is enough to convict you. Do you remember that snarl, Mr. Leeds? Will you ever forget it? Your old friend Nobby, his last words for you - "
Leeds' head went forward, dropping, and his hands came up to cover his face. He made no sound, and no one else did either. The silence darted around us and into us, coming out from Leeds. Then Lina Darrow took in a breath with a sighing, sobbing sound, and Annabel got up and went to her.

==> IT WAS nothing out of the ordinary that Mrs. Barry Rackham had made the appointment with her finger pressed to her lips. That is by no means an unusual gesture for people who find themselves in a situation where the best thing they can think of is to make arrangements to see Nero Wolfe. <==
With Mrs. Barry Rackham the shushing finger was only figurative, since she made the date speaking to me on the phone. It was in her voice, low and jerky, and also in the way she kept telling me how confidential it was, even after I solemnly assured her that we rarely notified the press when someone requested an appointment on business. At the end she told me once more that she would have preferred to speak to Mr. Wolfe himself, and I hung up and decided it rated a discreet routine check on a prospective client, starting with Mr. Mitchell at the bank and Lon Cohen at the Gazette. On the main point of interest, could she and did she pay her bills, the news was favorable: she was worth a good four million and maybe five. Calling it four, and assuming that Wolfe's bill for services rendered would come to only half of it, that would be enough to pay my current salary - as Wolfe's secretary, trusted assistant and official gnat - for a hundred and sixty-seven years; and in addition to that, living as I did there in Wolfe's house, I also got food and shelter. So I was fixed for life if it turned out that she needed two million bucks' worth of detective work.
She might have at that, judging from the way she looked and acted at 11:05 the next morning, Friday, when the doorbell rang and I went to let her in. There was a man on the stoop with her, and after glancing quickly east and then west she brushed past him and darted inside, grabbed my sleeve, and told me in a loud whisper, "You're not Nero Wolfe!" Instantly she released me, seized the elbow of her companion to hurry him across the sill, and whispered at him explosively, "Come in and shut the door!" You might have thought she was a duchess diving into a hock shop.

ot that she was my idea of a duchess physically. As I attended to the door and got the man's hat and topcoat hung on the rack, I took them in.
She was a paradox - bony from the neck up and ample from the neck down. On her chin and jawbone and cheekbone the skin was stretched tight, but alongside her mouth and nose were tangles of wrinkles.

IT WAS nothing out of the ordinary that Mrs. Barry Rackham had made the appointment with her finger pressed to her lips. That is by no means an unusual gesture for people who find themselves in a situation where the best thing they can think of is to make arrangements to see Nero Wolfe.
With Mrs. Barry Rackham the shushing finger was only figurative, since she made the date speaking to me on the phone. It was in her voice, low and jerky, and also in the way she kept telling me how confidential it was, even after I solemnly assured her that we rarely notified the press when someone requested an appointment on business. At the end she told me once more that she would have preferred to speak to Mr. Wolfe himself, and I hung up and decided it rated a discreet routine check on a prospective client, starting with Mr. Mitchell at the bank and Lon Cohen at the Gazette. On the main point of interest, could she and did she pay her bills, the news was favorable: she was worth a good four million and maybe five. Calling it four, and assuming that Wolfe's bill for services rendered would come to only half of it, that would be enough to pay my current salary - as Wolfe's secretary, trusted assistant and official gnat - for a hundred and sixty-seven years; and in addition to that, living as I did there in Wolfe's house, I also got food and shelter.

"Yes," she whispered. She nodded and said right out loud, "Of course."

"Then you ought to stop trembling if you can. It makes Mr. Wolfe uneasy when a woman trembles because he thinks she's going to be hysterical, and he might not listen to you. Take a deep breath and try to stop."
"You were trembling all the way down here in the car," the man said in a mild baritone.
"I was not!" she snapped. That settled, she turned to me. "This is my cousin, Calvin Leeds. He didn't want me to come here, but I brought him along anyhow. Where's Mr. Wolfe?"
I indicated the door to the office, went and opened it, and ushered them in.

She had my sympathy up to a point, but what stuck out was her basic assumption that rich people can always get anything they want just by putting up the dough. That's enough to give an honest workingman, like a private detective for instance, a pain in three places. The assumption is of course sound in some cases, but what rich people are apt not to understand is that there are important exceptions. This, however, was not one of them, and I hoped Wolfe would see that it wasn't. He did. He didn't want to, but the bank account had by no means fully recovered from the awful blow of March fifteenth, only three weeks back, and he knew it. He came forward in his chair for a glance at the check, caught my eye and saw how I felt about it, heaved a sigh, and spoke.
"Your notebook, Archie. Confound it."
THE following morning, Saturday, I was in the office typing the final report on a case which I will not identify by name because it was never allowed to get within a mile of a newspaper or a microphone. We were committed on Mrs. Rackham's job, since I had deposited her check Friday afternoon, but no move had been made yet, not even a phone call to any of the names she had given us, because it was Wolfe's idea that first of all we must have a look at him. With Wolfe's settled policy of never leaving his house on business, and with no plausible excuse for getting Barry Rackham to the office, I would have to do the looking, and that had been arranged for.
Mrs. Rackham had insisted that her husband must positively not know or even suspect that he was being investigated, and neither must anyone else, so the arrangements for the look were a little complicated. She vetoed my suggestion

==>  that I should be invited to join a small weekend gathering at her country home in Westchester, on the ground that someone would probably recognize the Archie Goodwin who worked for Nero Wolfe. It was Calvin Leeds who offered an amendment that was adopted. He had a little place of his own at the edge of her estate, where he raised dogs, called Hillside Kennels. A month ago one of his valuable dogs had been poisoned, and I was to go there Saturday afternoon as myself, a detective named Archie Goodwin, to investigate the poisoning. His cousin would invite him to her place, Birchvale, for dinner, and I would go along. <==
It was a quiet Saturday morning in the office, with Wolfe up in the plant rooms as usual from nine to eleven, and I finished typing the report of a certain case with no interruptions except a couple of phone calls which I handled myself, and one for which I had to give Wolfe a buzz - from somebody at Mummiani's on Fulton Street to say that they had just got eight pounds of fresh sausage from Bill Darst at Hackettstown, and Wolfe could have half of it. Since Wolfe regards Darst as the best sausage maker west of Cherbourg, he asked that it be sent immediately by messenger, and for heaven's sake not with dry ice.
When, at 11:00, the sound of Wolfe's elevator came, I got the big dictionary in front of me on my desk, opened to H, and was bent over it as he entered the office, crossed to his oversized custom-built chair, and sat. He didn't bite at once because his mind was elsewhere. Even before he rang for beer he asked, "Has the sausage come?"
Without looking up I told him no.
He pressed the button twice - the beer signal - leaned back, and frowned at me. I didn't see the frown, absorbed as I was in the dictionary, but it was in his tone of voice.
"What are you looking up?" he demanded.

"Who brought that package?"
I told him Fleet Messenger Service.
When the breeze through the hall had cleared the air I returned to the kitchen and Fritz joined me - We gave the package a look and found it was quite simple: a metal cylinder with a valve, with a brass rod that had been adjusted so that when the package was opened so was the valve. There was still a strong smell, close up, and Fritz took it to the basement. I went to the office and found Wolfe behind his desk, busy at the phone. I dropped into my chair and dabbed at my runny eyes with my handkerchief. When he hung up I asked, "Any luck?"
"I didn't expect any," he growled. "Right. Shall I call a cop?"
"No."
==> I nodded. "The question was rhetorical." I dabbed at my eyes some more, and blew my nose. "Nero Wolfe does not call cops. Nero Wolfe opens his own packages of sausage and makes his own enemies bite the dust" I blew my nose again. "Nero Wolfe is a man who will go far if he opens one package too many. Nero Wolfe has never - " <==
"The question was not rhetorical," Wolfe said rudely. "That is not what rhetorical means."
"No? I asked it. I meant it to be rhetorical. Can you prove that I don't know what rhetorical means?" I blew my nose. "When you ask me a question, which God knows is often, do I assume - "
The phone rang. One of the million things I do to earn my salary is to answer it, so I did. And then a funny thing happened. There is absolutely no question that it was a shock to me to hear that voice, I know that, because I felt it in my stomach. But partly what makes a shock a shock is that it is unexpected, and I do not think the sound of that voice in my ear was unexpected. I think that Wolfe

 and I had been sitting there talking just to hear ourselves because we both expected, after what had happened, to hear that voice sooner or later - and probably sooner.

I felt it in my stomach, sharp and strong, but damned if I was going to let him know it. I said, but not cordially, "Oh, hello there. If I get you. Was your name Duncan once?"
"Yes. Mr. Wolfe, please."
"Hold the wire." I covered the transmitter and told Wolfe, "Whosis."
"Who?" he demanded.
"You know who from my face. Mr. X. Mr. Z. Him."
==> With his lips pressed tight, Wolfe reached for his phone. "This is Nero Wolfe." <==
"How do you do, Mr. Wolfe." I was staying on, and the hard, cold, precise voice sounded exactly as it had the four previous times I had heard it, over a period of three years. It pronounced all its syllables clearly and smoothly.
"Do you know who I am?"
"Yes." Wolfe was curt. "What do you want?"
"I want to call your attention to my forbearance. That little package could have been something really destructive, but I preferred only to give you notice. As I told you about a year ago, it's a more interesting world with you in it."
"I find it so," Wolfe said dryly.

I grinned at her. "Showing off. Okay? Want to try it? Get him and send him out from behind that same bush, with orders to take me, and any amount up to two bits, even, that he won't reach me." I returned the gun to the holster. "Ready?"
She blinked. "You mean you would?"
Hammond giggled. He was a full-sized middle-aged man and he looked like a banker, and I want to be fair to him, but he giggled. "Look out, Annabel," he said warningly. "He might."
"Of course," I told her, "you would be in the line of fire, and I've never shot a fast-moving dog, so we would both be taking a risk. Only I don't like you being skeptical. Stick around and you'll see."
That was a mistake, caused by my temperament. It is natural and wholesome for a man of my age to enjoy association with a woman of her age, maid, wife, or widow, but I should have had sense enough to stop to realize what I was getting in for. She had said that she had come to watch me work, and there I was asking for it. As a result, I had to spend a solid hour pretending that I was hell bent to find out who had poisoned one of Leeds' dogs when I didn't care a hang. Not that I love dog-poisoners, but that wasn't what was on my mind.
==> When Calvin Leeds showed up, as he did soon in an old station wagon with its rear taken up with a big wire cage, the four of us made a tour of the kennels and the runs, with Leeds briefing me, and me asking questions and making notes, and then we went in the house and extended the inquiry to aspects such as the poison used, the method employed, the known suspects, and so on. It was a strain. I had to make it good, because that was what I was supposed to be there for, and also because Annabel was too good-looking to let her be skeptical about me. And the dog hadn't even died! He was alive and well. But I went to it as if it were the biggest case of the year for Nero Wolfe and me, and Leeds got a good fifty bucks' worth of detection for nothing. Of course nobody got detected, but I asked damn good questions. <==
After Annabel and Hammond left to return to Birchvale next door, I asked Leeds about Hammond, and sure enough he was a banker. He was a vice- president of the Metropolitan Trust Company, who handled affairs for Mrs. Rackham - had done so ever since the death of her first husband. When I remarked that Hammond seemed to have it in mind to handle Mrs. Rackham's daughter-in-law also, Leeds said he hadn't noticed. I asked who else would be there at dinner.
"You and me," Leeds said. He was sipping a highball, taking his time with it. We were in the little living room of his little house, about which there was

 nothing remarkable except the dozens of pictures of dogs on the walls. Moving around outside, there had been more spring to him than to lots of guys half his age; now he was sprawled on a couch, all loose. I was reminded of one of the dogs we had come upon during our tour, lying in the sun at the door of its kennel.
"You and me," he said, "and my cousin and her husband, and Mrs. Frey, whom you have met, and Hammond, and the statesman, that's seven - "

out there, or a woman?"
"A woman," I said firmly. "I haven't run across her yet, there are so many,
but even if she does turn out to be a dog I hope to God it won't be one of yours. I want the kind I can let run loose." I waved a hand. "Forget it. You like 'em, you can have 'em. Mrs. Frey is a member of the household, is she?"
"Yes," he said shortly.
"Mrs. Rackham keeping her around as a souvenir of her dead son? Being neurotic about it?"
==> "I don't know. Ask her." Leeds straightened up and got to his feet. "You know, of course, that I didn't approve of her going to Nero Wolfe. I went with her only because she insisted on it. I don't see how any good can come of it, but I think harm might. I don't think you ought to be here, but you are, and we might as well go on over and drink their liquor instead of mine. I'll go and wash up." <==

 He left me.

HAVING been given by Leeds my choice of driving over - three minutes - or taking a trail through the woods, I voted for walking. The edge of the woods was only a hundred yards to the rear of the kennels. It had been a warm day for early April, but now, with the sun gone over the hill, the sharp air made me want to step it up, which was just as well because I had to, to keep up with Leeds. He walked as if he meant it. When I commented on the fact that we ran into no fence anywhere, neither in the woods nor in the clear, he said that his place was merely a little corner of Mrs. Rackham's property which she had let him build on some years ago.
The last stretch of our walk was along a curving gravel path that wound through lawns, shrubs, trees, and different - shaped patches of bare earth.

Pierce was a smooth article. His manner was of course based on the law of nature regulating the attitude of an elected person toward everybody old enough to vote, but his timing and variations were so good that it was hard to recognize it, although he was only about my age. He was also about my size, with broad shoulders and a homely honest face, and a draw on his smile as swift as a flash bulb. I made a note to look up whether I lived in his assembly district. If he got the breaks the only question about him was how far and how soon.


If in addition to his own equipment and talents he acquired Lina Darrow
as a partner, it would probably be farther and sooner. She was, I would have guessed, slightly younger than Annabel Frey - twenty-six maybe - and I never saw a finer pair of eyes. She was obviously underplaying them, or rather what was back of them. When I was questioning her she pretended I had her in a corner, while her eyes gave it away that she could have waltzed all around me if she wanted to. I didn't know whether she thought she was kidding somebody, or was just practicing, or had some serious reason for passing herself off as a fib.
==> Barry Rackham had me stumped and also annoyed. Either I was dumber than Nero Wolfe thought I was, and twice as dumb as I thought I was, or he was smarter than he looked. New York was full of him, and he was full of New York. Go into any Madison Avenue bar between five and six-thirty and there would be six or eight of him there: not quite young but miles from being old; masculine all over except the fingernails; some tired and some fresh and ready, depending on the current status; and all slightly puffy below the eyes. I knew him from A to Z, or thought I did, but I couldn't make up my mind whether he knew what I was there for, and that was the one concrete thing I had hoped to get done. If he knew, the question whether he was on Zeck's payroll was answered; if he didn't, that question was still open. <==
And I still hadn't been able to decide when, at the dinner table, we had finished the dessert and got up to go elsewhere for coffee. At first I had thought he couldn't possibly be wise, when I had him sized up for a dummy who had had the good luck to catch Mrs. Rackham's eye somewhere and then had happened to take the only line she would fall for, but further observation had made me reconsider. His handling of his wife had character in it; it wasn't just yes or no. At the dinner table he had an exchange with Pierce about rent control, and without seeming to try he got the statesman so tangled up he couldn't wiggle loose. Then he had a good laugh, took the other side of the argument, and made a monkey out of Dana Hammond.
I decided I'd better start all over.
On the way back to the living room for coffee, Lina Darrow joined me. "Why did you take it out on me?" she demanded.
I said I didn't know I had.
"Certainly you did. Trying to indict me for dog poisoning. You went after

"Think you'll get anywhere on your job for Leeds?" he asked, jiggling his highball glass to make the ice tinkle.
I lifted my shoulders and let them drop. "I don't know. A month's gone by."
He nodded. "That's what makes it hard to believe." "Yeah, why?"


==> "That he would wait a month and then decide to blow himself to a fee for Nero Wolfe. Everybody knows that Wolfe comes high. I wouldn't have thought Leeds could afford it." Rackham smiled at me. "Driving back tonight?" <==
"No, I'm staying over."
"That's sensible. Night driving is dangerous, I think. The Sunday traffic won't be bad this time of year if you leave early." He touched my chest with a forefinger. "That's it, leave early." He moved off.
Annabel was yawning, and Dana Hammond was looking at her as if that was exactly what he had come to Birchvale for, to see her yawn. Lina Darrow was looking from Barry Rackham to me and back again, and pretending she wasn't looking anywhere with those eyes. The Doberman pinscher was standing tense, and Pierce, from a safe ten feet - one more than springing distance - was regarding it with an expression that gave me a more sympathetic feeling for him than I ever expected to have for a statesman.
Calvin Leeds and Mrs. Rackham were also looking at the dog, with a quite different expression.
"At least two pounds overweight," Leeds was saying. "You feed him too much."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 347    window = 342 352

He pulled free and started off.
"Wait!" I commanded, and he halted. "But first get a doctor and call the police. Do that first. I'm going to your place. We left that knife in the dog, and someone might want it. Can't you put Hebe on guard here?"
He spoke, not to me but to Hebe. She came to him, a darting shadow, close to him. He leaned over to touch the shoulder of the body of Mrs. Barry Rackham and said, "Watch it, Hebe." The dog moved alongside the body, and Leeds, with nothing to say to me, went. He didn't leap or run, but he sure was gone. I called after him, "Phone the police before you kill anybody!" stepped to the trail, and headed for Hillside Kennels.
With the flashlight I had no trouble finding my way. This time, as I approached, the livestock barked plenty, and, hoping the kennel doors were all closed tight, I had my gun out as I passed the runs and the buildings. Nothing attacked me but noise, and that stopped when I had entered the house and dosed the door. Apparently if an enemy once got inside it was then up to the master.
Nobby was still there on the bench, and the knife was still in him. With only a glance at him in passing, I made for the little living room, where I had previously seen a phone on a table, fumed on a light, went to the phone, and got the operator and gave her a number. As I waited a look at my wristwatch showed me five minutes past midnight. I hoped Wolfe hadn't forgotten to plug in the line to his room when he went up to bed. He hadn't. After the ring signal had come five times I had his voice.
==> "Nero Wolfe speaking." <==
"Archie. Sorry to wake you up, but I need orders. We're minus a client. Mrs. Rackham. This is a quick guess, but it looks as if someone stabbed her with a knife and then stuck the knife in a dog. Anyhow, she's dead. I've just - "
"What is this?" It was almost a bellow. "Flummery?"
"No, sir. I've just come from where she's lying in the woods. Leeds and I found her. The dog's dead too, here on a bench. I don't - "
"Archie!"
"Yes, sir."

A grunt and a pause. "On what I know now, everything about Mrs. Rackham's talk with me and the purpose of your trip there. About Mrs. Rackham and Mr. Leeds and what you have seen and heard there, everything. But you will of course confine yourself strictly to that."
"Nothing about sausage?"
"Absolutely nothing. The question is idiotic."
"Yeah, I just asked. Okay. Well, I got here and met dogs and people.
Leeds' place is on a corner of Mrs. Rackham's property, and we walked through the woods for dinner at Birchvale. There were eight of us at dinner...."
==> I'm fairly good with a billiard cue, and only Saul Panzer can beat me at tailing a man or woman in New York, but what I am best at is reporting a complicated event to Nero Wolfe. With, I figured, a probable maximum of ten minutes for it, I covered all the essentials in eight, leaving him two for questions. He had some, of course. But I think he had the picture well enough to sleep on when I saw the light of a car through the window, told him good-by, and hung up. I stepped from the living room into the little hall, opened the outside door, and was standing on the stone slab as a car with STATE POLICE painted on it came down the narrow drive and stopped. Two uniformed public servants piled out and made for me. I only hoped neither of them was my pet Westchester hate, Lieutenant Con Noonan, and had my hope granted. They were both rank-and- file. <==
One of them spoke. "Your name Goodwin?"
I conceded it. Dogs had started to bark.
"After finding a dead body you went off and came here to rest your feet?" "I didn't find the body. A dog did. As for my feet, do you mind stepping
inside?"
I held the door open, and they crossed the threshold. With a thumb I called

Archer, slightly plumper than he had been a year ago, with his round red

 face saggy and careworn by the stress of an extremely bad night for him, put his forearms on the table and leaned at me.
"Goodwin," he said earnestly but not offensively, "I want to put something up to you."
"Suits me, Mr. Archer," I assured him. "I've never been ignored more."
==> "We've been busy. Lieutenant Noonan has of course reported what you told him. Frankly, I find it hard to believe. Almost impossible to believe. It is well known that Nero Wolfe refuses dozens of jobs every month, that he confines himself to cases that interest him, and that the easiest and quickest way to interest him is to offer him a large fee. Now I - " <==
"Not the only way," I objected.
"I didn't say it was. I know he has standards - even scruples. Now I can't believe that he found anything interesting in the poisoning of a dog - certainly not interesting enough for him to send you up here over a weekend. And I doubt very much if Calvin Leeds, from what I know of him, is in a position to offer Wolfe a fee that would attract him. His cousin, Mrs. Rackham, might have, but she did not have the reputation of throwing money around carelessly - rather the contrary. We're going to ask Wolfe about this, naturally, but I thought I might save time by putting it up to you. I appeal to you to cooperate with us in solving this dastardly and cowardly murder. As you know, I have a right to insist on it; knowing you and Wolfe as I do, I prefer to appeal to you as to a responsible citizen and a man who carries a license to work in this state as a private detective. I simply do not believe that you were sent up here merely to investigate the poisoning of a dog."
They were all glaring at me.
"I wasn't," I said mildly.
"Ha, you weren't!"

"He left them on the table in his room - for Theodore and me, and one for you - "
I snatched the pieces of paper from his trembling hand and looked at the one on top. The writing on it was Wolfe's.
Dear Fritz;
Marko Vukcic will want your services. He should pay you at least $2000 a month.
My best regards....

He left me, and I sat down at my desk to do the thinking, but the cogs wouldn't catch. I was too mad to think. "Don't look for me." That was him to a T. He knew damn well that if I should ever come home to find he had vanished, the one activity that would make any sense at all would be to start looking for him, and here I was stopped cold at the take-off. Not that I had no notion at all. That was why I had left Leeds' place without notice and stepped it up to eighty-five getting back: I did have a notion. Two years had passed since Wolfe had told me, "Archie, you are to forget that you know that man's name. If ever, in the course of my business, I find that I am committed against him and must destroy him, I shall leave this house, find a place where I can work - and sleep and eat if there is time for it - and stay there until I have finished."
So that part was okay, but what about me? On another occasion, a year later, he had said to five members of a family named Sperling, in my presence, "In that event he will know it is a mortal encounter, and so will I, and I shall move to a base of operations which will be known only to Mr. Goodwin and perhaps two others." Okay. There was no argument with the mortal encounter or about the move. But I was the Mr. Goodwin referred to, and here I was staring at it - "Don't look for me." Where did that leave me? Certainly the two others he had had in mind were Saul Panzer and Marko Vukcic, and I didn't even dare to phone Saul and ask a couple of discreet questions; and besides, if he had let Saul in and left me out, to hell with him. And what was I supposed to say to people - for instance, people like the District Attorney of Westchester County?
That particular question got answered, partly at least, from an unexpected

 quarter. When I had finished with the griddle cakes, ham, eggs, thyme honey, and coffee, I went back to the office to see if I was ready to quit feeling and settle down to thinking, and was working at it when I became aware that I was sitting in Wolfe's chair behind his desk. That brought me up with a jerk. No one else, including me, ever sat in that chair, but there I was. I didn't approve of it. It seemed to imply that Wolfe was through with that chair for good, and that was a hell of an attitude to take, no matter how sore I was. I opened a drawer of his desk to check its contents, pretending that was what I had sat there for, and was starting a careful survey when the doorbell rang.
==> Going to answer it, I took my time because I had done no thinking yet and therefore didn't know my lines. Seeing through the one-way glass panel in the front door that the man on the stoop was a civilian stranger, my first impulse was to let him ring until he got tired, but curiosity chased it away and I opened the door. He was just a citizen with big ears and an old topcoat, and he asked to see Mr. Nero Wolfe. I told him Mr. Wolfe wasn't available on Sundays, and I was his confidential assistant, and could I help. <==
He thought maybe I could, took an envelope from a pocket, extracted a sheet of paper, and unfolded it.
"I'm from the Gazette," he stated. "This copy for an ad we got in the mail this morning - we want to be sure it's authentic."

 took the paper and gave it a look. It was one of our large-sized letterheads, and the writing and printing on it were Wolfe's. At the top was written:
Display advertisement for Monday's Gazette, first section, two columns wide, depth as required. In thin type, not blatant. Send bill to above address.

"I only wanted - "
"Skip it. I advise you to steer clear of me until I've had a chance to think." I went to the office and this time took my own chair. At least I had got
some instructions from Wolfe, though his method of sending them was certainly

 roundabout. The ad meant, of course, that I wasn't to try to cover his absence; on the contrary. More important, it told me to lay off of the Rackham thing. I was to handle inquiries from clients on unfinished matters, but only from clients; and since Mrs. Rackham, being dead, couldn't inquire, that settled that. Another thing - apparently I still had my job, unlike Fritz and Theodore. But I couldn't sign checks, I couldn't - suddenly I remembered something. The fact that I hadn't thought of it before indicates the state I was in. I have told, in my account of another case of Wolfe's how, in anticipation of the possibility that some day a collision with Arnold Zeck would drive him into a foxhole, he had instructed me to put fifty thousand dollars in cash in a safe deposit box over in Jersey, and how I obeyed instructions. The idea was to have a source of supply for the foxhole; but anyway, there it was, fifty grand, in the box rented by me under the name I had selected for the purpose. I was sitting thinking how upset I must have been not to have thought of that before when the phone rang and I reached for it.
==> "Nero Wolfe's office, Archie Goodwin speaking." <==
I thought it proper to use that, the familiar routine, since according to Wolfe's ad he wouldn't retire until the next day.
"Archie?" A voice I knew sounded surprised. "Is that you, Archie?" "Right. Hello, Marko. So early on Sunday?"
"But I thought you were away! I was going to give Fritz a message for
you. From Nero."

Marko Vukcic, owner and operator of Rusterman's Restaurant, the only
place where Wolfe really liked to eat except at home, was the only man in New York who called Wolfe by his first name. I told him I would be glad to take a message for myself.
"Not from Nero actually," he said. "From me. I must see you as soon as possible. Could you come here?"
I said I could. There was no need to ask where, since the only place he could ever be found was the restaurant premises, either on one of the two floors for the public, in the kitchen, or up in his private quarters.
I told Fritz I was going out and would be back when he saw me.

As I drove crosstown and up to 54th Street, I was around eighty per cent sure that within a few minutes I would be talking with Wolfe. For him it would be hard to beat that for a foxhole - the place that cooked and served the best food in America, with the living quarters of his best and oldest friend above it. Even after I had entered at the side door, as arranged, ascended the two flights of stairs, seen the look on Marko's face as he welcomed me, felt the tight clasp of his fingers as he took my hands in his, and heard his murmured "My friend, my poor young friend!" - even then I thought he was only preparing dramatically to

 lead me to Wolfe in an inner room.

 lead me to Wolfe in an inner room.
But he wasn't. All he led me to was a chair by a window. He took another one, facing me, and sat with his palms on his knees, his head cocked a little to one side as usual.
==> "My friend Archie," he said sympathetically. "It is my part to tell you exactly certain things. But before I do that I wish to tell you a thing of my own. I wish to remind you that I have known Nero a much longer time than you have. We knew each other as boys in another country - much younger than you were that day many years ago when you first saw him and went to work for him. He is my old and dear friend, and I am his. So it was natural that he should come to me last night." <==
"Sure," I agreed. "Why not?"
"You must feel no pique. No courroux."
"Okay. I'll fight it down. What time did he come?"
"At two o'clock in the night. He was here an hour, and then left. That I am
to tell you, and these things. Do you want to write them down?"

"I can remember them if you can. Shoot."
==> Marko nodded. "I know of your great memory. Nero has often spoken of <==
it." He shut his eyes and in a moment opened them again. "There are these five things. First, the plants. He telephoned Mr. Hewitt last night, and tomorrow Mr. Hewitt will arrange for the plants to be moved to his place, and also for Theodore to go there to work. Second - "
"Am I to list the plants? Do the records go too?"
"I don't know. I can say only what I was told to say. That's all about the plants. Perhaps Mr. Hewitt can tell you. Second, that is Fritz. He will work here, and I will pay him well. I will see him today and arrange the details. Of course he is unhappy?"
"He thinks Mr. Wolfe will starve to death."
"But naturally. If not that, something else. I have always thought it a folly for him to be a detective. Third - I am third. I have a power of attorney. Do you want to see it?"

==> "It is in there locked up. Nero said it is legal, and he knows. I can sign checks for you. I can sign anything. I can do anything he could do." <==
"Within certain limits. You can't - " I waved a hand. "Forget it. Fourth?"
"Fourth is the house. I am to offer the house and its contents for sale. On that I have confidential instructions."
I goggled at him. "Sell the house and contents?"
"Yes. I have private instructions regarding price and terms."

"I don't believe it."
==> His shoulders went up and down. "I told Nero you would think I was <==
lying."
"I don't think you're lying. I just don't believe it. Also the bed and other
articles in my room are my property. Must I move them out today or can I wait until tomorrow?"
Marko made a noise that I think was meant for sympathy. "My poor young friend," he said apologetically, "there is no hurry at all. Selling a house is not like selling a lamb chop. You will, I suppose, continue to live there for the present."
"Did he say I should?"

==> "No, But why shouldn't you? That is my own thought, and it brings us to the fifth and last thing: the instructions Nero gave me for you." <==
"Oh, he did. That was thoughtful. Such as?"
"You are to act in the light of experience as guided by intelligence." He stopped. I nodded. "That's a cinch, I always do. And specifically?" "That's all. Those are your instructions." Marko upturned his palms. "That's all about everything."
"You call that instructions, do you?"
"I don't. He did." He leaned to me. "I told him, Archie, that his conduct
was inexcusable. He was standing ready to leave, after telling me those five things and no more. Having no reply, he turned and went: Beyond that I know nothing, but nothing,"

"Let me talk to him."
That was satisfactory. I liked that all right, except for one thing. After the
Westchester dick was finished on the phone and it was settled that I would roll my own, and the sergeant had generously said that the Police Department would contribute the phone call, I asked the dick if he understood that I didn't care to be
==> tailed, and he replied that I needn't worry because he was going back to 35th Street to see Nero Wolfe. I didn't care much for that, but said nothing because I hadn't yet decided exactly what to say. So when I found a place on Lexington Avenue for a sandwich and a malted, I went first to a phone booth, called the house, and told Fritz to leave the chain bolt on, tell callers that Wolfe was out of the city and no more, and admit no one. <==
Being on the move did help. Having decided, while touring the park and avenues, what my immediate trouble was, I now, on my way to Birchvale, got the whole thing into focus. Considering the entire picture, including the detail of putting the house up for sale and the lack of even one little hint for me, let alone a blueprint, it was by no means a bet that Wolfe had merely dived into a foxhole. Look how free Marko had been with his poor-young-friending. It was not inconceivable that Wolfe had decided to chuck it for good. A hundred times and more, when things or people - frequently me - didn't suit him, he had told me about the house he owned in Egypt and how pleasant it would be to live there. I had always brushed it off. I now realized that a man who is eccentric enough to threaten to go and live in Egypt is eccentric enough to do it, especially when it gets to the point where he opens a package of sausage and has to run for his life.
Therefore I would be a dimwit to assume that this was merely time out to gather ammunition and make plans. Nor could I assume that it wasn't. I couldn't assume anything. Was he gone for good, or was he putting on a charade that would make all his other performances look like piker stuff in comparison? Presumably I was to answer that question, along with others, by the light of experience guided by intelligence, and I did not appreciate the compliment. If I was finally and permanently on my own, very well; I would make out. But apparently I was still drawing pay, so what? The result of my getting the whole picture into focus was that as I turned in at the entrance to Birchvale I was sorer than ever.
I was stopped at the entrance by one of Noonan's colleagues, there on guard, and was allowed to proceed up the curving drive only after I had shown him four documents. Parking in a space at the side of the house that was bordered by evergreens, I walked around to the front door and was admitted by a maid who looked pale and puffy. She didn't say anything, just held the door open, but a man was there too, one of the county boys whom I knew by sight but

 not by name. He said, "This way," and led me to the right, to the same small room I had seen before.

The skinny guy got up, with his notebook, and left. After the door was
closed Archer spoke.
"You might as well know it, Goodwin; you've been contradicted. Mr.
Rackham says you're lying about his wife's conversation with Wolfe." "Yeah? How does he know? He wasn't there."
"He says that she couldn't possibly have said what you report because it
==> wasn't true. He says that there was no question or misunderstanding about money between them. He also says that she told him that she suspected her financial affairs were being mishandled by Mr. Hammond of the Metropolitan Trust Company, and that she was going to consult Nero Wolfe about it." <==
"Well." I yawned. "That's interesting. Leeds is on my side. Who's on his?" "No one so far."
"Have you tried it out on Leeds?"
"Yes. As you say, he's on your side. He has signed a statement. So has Mr.
Rackham."
"What does Hammond say?"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 766    window = 761 771

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34783    window = 34778 34788


"Yes. The will was read to the family today. I was present. There are a number of bequests to servants and distant relatives, Mrs. Frey gets this place and a million dollars. Leeds gets half a million. Lina Darrow gets two hundred thousand. The rest goes to Mr. Rackham."


"I see. Then he's a millionaire, so it's delicate. Even so, he's a damn liar
and it's two to one. I'll sign that statement in triplicate if you want it. Beyond that what can I say?"
==> "I want to make it three to one." Archer leaned to me. "Listen, Goodwin. I have great respect for Nero Wolfe's talents, I have reason to, as you know. But I do not intend to let his whims interfere with the functions of my office. I want a statement from him supporting yours and Leeds', and I mean to have it without delay. I sent a man to get it. This morning at eleven o'clock he was told that Wolfe wasn't available and that you weren't there and your whereabouts were not known. That was when an alarm was spread for you. I had a phone call from my man an hour ago. He had gone back to Wolfe's house and had been told that Wolfe was out of the city, and that was all he could get." <==
Archer made a hand into a fist, resting on the table. "I won't stand for it, Goodwin. This is the toughest one I've had in my county since I took office, and I won't stand for it. Whatever else he is, he's a fat conceited peacock and it's time somebody called him. There's a phone you can use. Two hours from now, unless he's here and talking to me, there'll be a warrant for his arrest as a material witness. There's the phone."
"I doubt if you could paste material witness on him. He hasn't been anywhere near here."
"Nuts," Ben Dykes growled. "Don't be a sap. She takes troubles to him Friday and gets murdered Saturday."
I decided to take the plunge. The way I felt, it would have been a pleasure to let them go ahead with a warrant, but if I tried to stall I would need a very fancy excuse tomorrow when they saw the ad in the Gazette. So I thought what the hell, now is as good a time as any, and told them.
"I can't phone him because I don't know where he is."

Archer ignored him. "And after telling you to withhold nothing from the police, Wolfe suddenly decides, in the middle of the night, that he has had enough of detective work, sends an ad to a newspaper announcing his retirement, calls on a friend to arrange for the care of his orchids - and what did he do then? I was so engrossed I may have missed something."
"I don't know what he did. He walked out. He disappeared."
I was aware, of course, of how it sounded. It was completely cuckoo. It was all rayon and a yard wide. I damn near made it even worse by telling them about the sausage and the tear gas, of course without letting on that we knew who had sent it, but realized in time how that would go over in the circumstances. That would have made a hit. But I had to say or do something, and decided to produce evidence, so I reached to my pocket for it.
"He left notes on the table in his bedroom," I said, "for Fritz and Theodore and me. Here's mine."
I handed it to Archer. He read it and passed it to Dykes, Dykes read it twice and returned it to Archer, who stuck it in his pocket.
==> "Jesus," Dykes said again, looking at me in a way I didn't like. "This is really something. I've always thought Nero Wolfe had a lot on the ball, and you too in a way, but this is about the worst I ever saw. Really." He turned to Archer. <==

 "It's plain what happened."
"It certainly is." Archer made a fist. "Goodwin, I don't ask you to tell me. I'll tell you. When you found Mrs. Rackham there dead, you and Leeds agreed on a tale about the visit to Nero Wolfe. Leeds came here to break the news. You went to his place to phone Wolfe and report, both the murder and the tale you and Leeds had agreed on - or maybe Wolfe knew that already, since you had pretended to investigate the dog poisoning. In any case, Wolfe knew something that he didn't dare to try to cover and that, equally, he didn't dare to reveal. What made it unbearably hot was the murder. So he arranged to disappear, and we haven't got him, and it may take a day or a week to find him. But we've got you."
The fist hit the table, not hard. "You know where Wolfe is. You know what he knows that he had to run away from. It is vital information required by me in my investigation of a murder. Surely you must see that your position is untenable, you can't possibly get away with it. Twenty Nero Wolfes couldn't bring you out of this with a whole skin. Even if he's cooking up one of his flashy surprises, even if he walks into my office tomorrow with the murderer and the evidence to convict him, I will not stand for this. There is no written record of what you said last night. I'll get the stenographer back in here and we'll tear up his notebook and what he has typed, and you can start from scratch."
"Better grab it, son," Dykes said, perfectly friendly. "Loyalty to your employer is a fine thing, but not when he's got a screw loose."

Archer stood up. "Get a material witness warrant and lock him up," he said, almost squeaking, and marched out.

There is no written record of what you said last night. I'll get the stenographer back in here and we'll tear up his notebook and what he has typed, and you can start from scratch." <==
"Better grab it, son," Dykes said, perfectly friendly. "Loyalty to your employer is a fine thing, but not when he's got a screw loose."
I yawned. "My God, I'm sleepy. I wouldn't mind this so much if I was helping out with a fix, good or bad, but it's a shame to get stuck with the truth. Ask me tomorrow, ask me all summer, I refuse to tell a lie. And I do not know where Mr. Wolfe is."
Archer stood up. "Get a material witness warrant and lock him up," he said, almost squeaking, and marched out.
VIII
THE jail at White Plains uses a gallon of strong disinfectant, diluting it, of course, every day including Sunday. I can back that statement up with two pieces of evidence: the word of the turnkey on the second-floor cell block, whose name is Wilkes, given to me personally, and my sense of smell, which is above average.

We were on the chairs, with the little wooden table between us. It was comfortable enough except that there was no room to prop up our morning papers. He flattened his out, still open at sports, on the end of the cot, and turned to it while disposing of a bite of food. I arranged mine, front page, on my knee. In the picture of Mrs, Rackham the poor woman looked homelier than she had actually been, which was a darned shame even though she wasn't alive to see it. Wolfe's name and mine both appeared in the sub-heads under the three-column spread about the murder. I glanced at the bottom, followed the instruction to turn to page four, and there saw more pictures. The one of Wolfe was only fair,

king him look almost bloated, but the one of me was excellent. There was one of a Doberman pinscher standing at attention. It was captioned Hebe, which I doubted. The play in the text on Wolfe and me was on his sudden retirement from business and absence from the city, and on my presence at the scene of the murder and arrest as a material witness. There was also a report of an interview with Marko Vukcic, a Gazette exclusive, with Lon Cohen's by-line. I would have given at least ten to one that Lon had used my name in getting to Marko.
With the breakfast all down, including the coffee, which was pretty good, I was so interested in my reading that I didn't notice that my mate had finished with sports and proceeded to other current events. What got my attention was the feeling that I was being scrutinized, and sure enough I was. He was looking at me, and then at his page four, and back at me again.
I grinned at him. "Pretty good likeness, huh? But I don't think that's the right dog. I'm no expert, but Hebe isn't quite as slim as that."
==> He was regarding me with a new expression, not particularly matey. "So you're Nero Wolfe's little Archie." <==
"I was." I gestured. "Read the paper. Apparently I am now my own little Archie."
"So I bought a meal for a shamus."
"Not at all. Didn't I say it was on me when I get my wallet back?"
He shook his head. "I wouldn't have believed it. With them clothes? I
supposed you had got snagged in the raid on the Covered Porch. It gets worse all the time, the dicks. Look at this, even here in the can I meet a guy with a suit of clothes like that, and he's a dick!"

"I'll brush my teeth and shave."
"Then what?"
I swiveled my head to glance at him. "You're pretty damn persistent.
Where do you want us to get to?"
"Nowhere in particular." He stayed supine, and I noticed that in profile he
==> looked a little like John L. Lewis, only a lot younger. He went on, "I was just thinking, with Nero Wolfe gone I suppose your job's gone. Can't I think?" <==
"Sure. If it doesn't hurt."
A brief silence. He spoke again. "I've heard about you a little. What kind of a guy are you?"
"Oh - I'm a thinker too, and I'm cultured. I got good marks in algebra. I sleep well. I'm honest and ambitious, with a good personality."
"You know your way around."
"In certain circles, yes. It would be hard to lose me within ten miles of Times Square unless I was blindfolded. What are the requirements of the position you are about to offer?"

1:35 PM
I was pleased to observe that he stuck to routine to the end, putting the time down. Also it was nice of him to end his note to me the same as Wolfe had ended his. Nevertheless, it was a discouraging welcome home after a night in the hoosegow. And there had been a period of more than five hours when any phone calls that might have come would not have been answered, something that had never happened before in all the years I had worked and lived there. Unless Theodore ...
I beat it to the stairs and up the three flights, and entered the plant rooms.
One step inside the first room, the warm one, I stopped and surveyed. It was more of a shock, somehow, than it had been a year ago when it had been used as a target for tommy guns from across the street. Then they had at least left a mess; now there was nothing but the benches and stands. It really got me for a minute. I moved on through: medium room, cool room, potting room, spray chamber, Theodore's room - all empty. Hewitt must have sent an army to dean all that out in one day, I thought, heading back downstairs.
In the kitchen was another longer note from Fritz, reporting phone calls that had come before he left and various minor matters. I opened the refrigerator and poked around, and settled for a jar of home-made pate, a hunk of Italian bread, Vermont cheese, and milk. As I sat working at it with an evening paper propped up before me, I kept listening for something - nothing in particular, just something. That had never been a noisy house, hut I had never known it anything like that quiet. Almost no cars went by, and the few that did must have been coasting in neutral.
==> My meal finished and things put away, I wandered into the dining room, office, front room, down to the basement to Fritz's room, up one flight to Wolfe's room, up another to my room. As I undressed for my post-jail bath, I thought that the hell of it wasn't how I felt, but that I didn't know how to feel. If I had actually seen the last of Nero Wolfe, it was a damn sad day for me, there were no two ways about that, and if I got a lump in my throat and somebody walked in I would just as soon show him the lump as not. <==
But what if it was Wolfe himself who walked in? That was the trouble. Damned if I was going to work up a fancy lump and then have him suddenly appear and start crabbing about something.
After I had bathed and shaved and got into clean pajamas, and answered a

 couple of phone calls from journalists, and moseyed down to the office and fooled around a while, someone did walk in. When I heard the front door open I made for the hall as if I had been expecting another package of sausage, and there was Fritz. He turned from closing the door, saw me, and beamed.
"Ah! Archie! You escaped?"

"Right. He's comparatively new to this section, but he's a fast mover. Not
really big yet. As far as I know, the only thing he's close to right in town is a string of rooms for transients. He seems to be specializing on little weekend

 roundups in the suburbs."
"Just games, or women, or what?"
==> "Anything men risk money for. Or pay it for. I have heard that he is seen around sometimes with Brownie Costigan. How curious are you? Is it worth a steak? Or is it worth a phone number or address where I can reach Nero Wolfe?" <==
By that time I had abandoned the idea of selling anyone, even Lon Cohen, the idea that I ever told the truth, so I thanked him and hung up.
A couple of checks in the morning mail, one from a man who was paying in installments for having a blackmailer removed from his throat, were no problem, since there was a rubber stamp for endorsing them, but in order to pay three bills that came in I had to make a trip to 54th Street to see if the formalities about Marko's power of attorney had been attended to. They had, by Parker, and I was glad to see that Marko signed the checks on my say-so, without looking at the bills. If he had started auditing on me I swear to God I would have moved out and got a hotel room.
There were other chores, such as phoning Hewitt's place on Long Island to ask if the plants and Theodore had arrived safely, making arrangements with a phone-answering service, handling a report from Fred Durkin on a poison-letter job that was the main item of unfinished business, and so on, but I managed to have them all under control when two o'clock came and brought Calvin Leeds.
When I went to let him in and took him to the office, there was a problem.
Should I sit at my desk or at Wolfe's? On the one hand, I was not Wolfe and had no intention of trying to be. On the other hand, when a pinch-hitter is called on he stands at the plate to bat, not off to one side. Also it would be interesting to see, from Wolfe's position, what the light was like on the face of a man sitting in the red leather chair. So again, this time intentionally, I sat behind Wolfe's desk.

Something like a million times I had seen Wolfe, faced with a belligerent statement from a caller, lean back and close his eyes. I thought I might as well try it, and did so. But the springs which let the chair's back slant to the rear were carefully adjusted to the pressure of Wolfe's poundage, not mine, and I had to keep pushing to maintain the damn thing in the leaning position.


"A man who comes forty miles for an explanation," I said, with my eyes
closed, "is entitled to one. What needs explaining?"
==> "Nero Wolfe's behavior does." <==
"That's nothing new." It was too much of a strain keeping the chair back in
a leaning position, and I straightened up. "It often has. But that's not my department."
"I want to see him."
"So do I."
"You're a liar, Goodwin."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 978    window = 973 983

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34995    window = 34990 35000


"I want to see him."
"So do I."
"You're a liar, Goodwin."
I shook my head, my lips tight. "You know," I said, "I have probably told
as many lies as any man my age except psychos. But I have never been called a liar as frequently as in the past twenty-four hours, and I have never stuck so close to the truth. To hell with it. Mr. Wolfe has gone south to train with the Dodgers. He will play shortstop."
==> "That won't help any," Leeds said, patient but determined, "that kind of talk. If you don't like being called a liar, neither do I, and the difference is that I'm not. The District Attorney says I'm lying, because Nero Wolfe has suddenly disappeared, and he disappeared because he doesn't dare answer questions about my cousin Sarah's visit to him here, and that proves that your report of that visit is false, and since my report is the same as yours mine is false too. Now that sounds logical, but there's a flaw in it. The flaw is their assumption that his disappearance was connected with my cousin's visit. I knew it couldn't have been, because there was nothing about our talk that day that could possibly have had such a result. I have told them that, and they think I'm lying. As long as they think I'm lying, and you too, they'll have their minds on that and they won't find out who killed my cousin and why - and anyway, I don't want to be suspected of lying when I'm not, especially not in connection with the murder of my cousin." <==
Leeds paused for breath and went on, "There's only one way out that I can see, and that's for you to tell them the real reason for Wolfe's disappearance - or, better still, he ought to tell them himself. I want you to put this up to him. Even if his own safety is involved, he ought to manage somehow. If it was something about some client that made him disappear, in the interest of some client, then you can tell him from me that I saw him take a check from my cousin for ten thousand dollars and it seems to me he's under obligation to her as much as any other client, to protect her interests, and it surely isn't in her interest to have suspicion centered in the wrong place about who killed her - and killed her dog too." His jaw quivered a little, and he clamped it tight.
"Do you mean," I inquired, "that suspicion is centered on you? How come?"
"Not on me as - as a murderer, I don't suppose so, but on me as a liar, and

 you and Wolfe. Even though she left me a great deal of money - I'm not thinking about being arrested for murder."

I am always ready for Inspector Cramer, in the light of experience guided by intelligence, and therefore didn't bat an eye. I merely cocked my head a little, met his gaze, and considered the matter until I was satisfied. "I doubt if it was Fritz," I stated. "Mr. Wolfe has him too well trained. But in the excitement Sunday morning, Mr. Wolfe being gone, Fritz told Theodore, and you got it out of Theodore." I nodded. "That must be it."
"Did the tear gas scare him out of his skin? Or out of his house, which is the same thing. Was that it?"
"It might have, mightn't it? A coward like him?"
"No." Cramer put the cigar between his teeth, tilted up. "No, there are plenty of things about Wolfe I can and do object to, but he's not a coward. There might have been something about that tear gas that would have scared anybody. Was there?"
"As far as I know, it was just plain tear gas, nothing fancy." I decided to shove a little. "You know, it's nice to have you here any time, just for company, but aren't you spreading out some? Your job is homicide, and the tear gas didn't even make us sick, let alone kill us. Also your job is in the County of New York, and Mrs. Rackham died in Westchester. I enjoy talking with you, but have you got credentials?"
==> He made a noise that could have been a chuckle. "That's more like it," he said, not sarcastically. "You're beginning to sound natural. I'll tell you. I'm here at the request of Ben Dykes, who would give all his teeth and one ear to clear up the Rackham case ahead of the state boys. He thinks that Archer, the DA, may have swallowed the idea that you and Leeds are lying too deep, and he came to me as an expert on Nero Wolfe, which God knows I am. He laid it all out for me and wanted my opinion." <==
He shifted the cigar to a new angle. "The way it looked to me, there were three possibilities. First, the one that Archer has sold himself on, that you and Leeds are lying, and that what Mrs. Rackham really told Wolfe when she came here, together with her getting murdered the next day, somehow put Wolfe on a spot that was too hot for him, and he scooted, after fixing with you to cover as well as you could. I told Dykes I would rule that out, for various reasons - chiefly because neither you nor Wolfe would risk that much on a setup that depended on a stranger like Leeds sticking to a lie. Shall I analyze it more?"
"No, thanks, that'll do."
"I thought so. Next, the possibility that when you phoned Wolfe right after the body was found you told him something that gave him a line on the

 murderer, but it's tricky and he had to go outdoors to get his evidence, preparing to grandstand it for the front page. I told Dykes I would rule that out too. Wolfe is quite capable of a play like that, sure he is, but if that's all it amounted to, why move the plants out and put Frits to work in a restaurant and list the house for sale? He's colorful, but not that colorful. Mrs. Rackham only paid him ten thousand, about what I make a year. Why should he spend it having his orchids carted around?"

"Glad to. But speaking as the bookkeeper, what do I charge it to?"
"Why - expense."
"Speaking as a man who may some day have to answer questions from an
internal revenue snoop, whose expense and what kind?" "Call it travel expense."
"Travel by whom and to where?"
==> Marko made some kind of a French noise, or foreign at least, indicating impatience, I think. "Listen, Archie, I have a power of attorney without limit. Bring me a check for five thousand dollars at your convenience. I am stealing it from my old friend Nero to spend on beautiful women or olive oil." <==
So I was not entirely correct when I said that I got no word at all from Wolfe during those weeks and months, but you must admit it was pretty vague. How far a man gets on five grand, and where he goes, depends on so many things.
When I returned to the office from a morning walk on the third day of May, a Wednesday, and called the phone-answering service as usual, I was told there had been three calls but only one message - to ring a Mount Kisco number and ask for Mrs. Frey. I considered the situation, told myself the thing to do was skip it, and decided that I must be hard of hearing when I became aware that I had dialed the operator and asked for the number.
Then, after I had got it and spelled my name and waited a minute, Annabel Frey's voice was in my ear. At least the voice said it was her, but I wouldn't have recognized it. It was sort of tired and hopeless.
"You don't sound like you," I told her.
"I suppose not," she conceded. "It seems like a million years since you came that day and we watched you being a detective. You never found out who poisoned the dog, did you?"

==> "Yes, of course. I don't suppose Nero Wolfe is back?" "Nope." <==
"You're running his office for him?"
"Well, I wouldn't call it running. I'm here."


"I want to see you."

"I want to see you."
"Excuse me for staring, but do you mean on business?"
"Yes." A pause, then her voice got more energetic. "I want you to come up
==> here and talk with us. I don't want to go on like this, and I'm not going to. When people look at me I can see it: in their eyes - was it me that killed my mother-in- law? - or in some of them I can see it, and that makes me think it's there with all of them. It's been nearly a month now, and all the police are doing - but you read the papers. She left me this place and a lot of money, and I wish I could hire Nero Wolfe. You must know where he is." <==
"Sorry. I don't."
"Then I want to hire you. You're a good detective, aren't you?" "Opinions vary. I rate myself close to the top, but you have to discount
that for my bias."
"Could you come up here today? This evening?"
"I couldn't make it today." My brain was having some exercise for the first

I picked it up and told the transmitter plainly, "Archie Goodwin's office." "May I speak to Mr. Goodwin, please?"
"I'll see if he's in. Who is calling, please?"
"Mrs. Frey."
"Yes, he's in. This is me. You got my note?"
'It came this morning. I don't know what you mean about representing no one but yourself."
==> "I guess I didn't make it very clear. I only meant I wouldn't be acting as Nero Wolfe's assistant. I'm just myself now." <==
"Oh. Well - naturally, if you don't even know where he is. Can you come this evening?"
"To Birchvale?"
"Yes."
"What time?"
"Say eight-thirty."

"Then they understand why I wasn't much interested in anyone but Rackham. And you and Miss Darrow, of course, but that interest wasn't professional. It looks to me like a case that will probably never be solved by exhibits or testimony on facts. The cops have had plenty of good men on it, and if they had got anything usable on footprints or fingerprints, or getting the steak knife from the drawer, or alibis or timetables, or something like shoes that had been worn in the woods, someone would have been arrested long ago. And they've had it for a month, so no kind of routine would be any good now, and that's all most detective work amounts to. Motive is no help, with four of you inheriting piles from two hundred grand up, and the other two possibly counting

 on marrying one of the piles. Only I must say, in the atmosphere here tonight, courtship doesn't seem to be on the program."
"It isn't," Annabel asserted.
I glanced at Hammond and Pierce, but neither of them seemed to want the floor.
==> "So," I continued, "unless the cops have got a trap set that you don't know about, it's one of those things. You never can tell. It would be a waste of money to pay me to go over the ground the cops have covered - or any other detective except Nero Wolfe, and he's not around. There's only one way to use me, or anyhow only one way to start, and stand a chance of getting your money's worth, and that would be to give me a good eight or ten hours with each of you six people, each one separately. I have watched and listened to Nero Wolfe a good many years and I can now do a fair imitation. <==
It might possibly rum out to be worth it to all of you - except one, as Mr. Pierce would say."
I flipped a hand. "That's the best suggestion I can offer. With nothing like a guarantee."
Annabel said, "No one would tell you everything you asked. I haven't myself, to the police."
"Sure. I understand that. That's part of it."
"You would be working for me - for us. It would be confidential." 'Things that weren't used would be confidential. Nothing that was

do now. I don't know what I would think after I had worked at it." "Do you think you know which one?"
"Nope. I'm impartial."
"All right. You can start with me." She turned her head. "Unless one of
you would rather first?"
No one moved or spoke. Then Calvin Leeds: "Count me out, Annabel. Not
==> with Goodwin. Let him tell us first where Nero Wolfe is and why." "But Cal - you won't?" <==
"Not with him I won't."
"Dana?"
Hammond looked unhappy. He got up and went to her. "Annabel, this was
a mistake. The whole idea was no good. What can Goodwin do that the police couldn't do? I doubt if you have any conception of how a private detective works."
"He can try. Will you help, Dana?"

July. Took a whirl at supervising ten men for a bunch of concessionaires at Coney Island; caught one of them taking a cut from doobey stands; he jumped me with a cooler and I broke his arm. Got tired of looking at a thousand acres of bare skin, mostly peeling, practically all nonseductive, and quit. Eight fifty for seventeen days. Had passed up at least two thousand worth of little chores. Screwball woman on Long Island had had jewelry stolen, uninsured, thought cops were in on it and stalling. Two things happened; I got some breaks, and I did a damn good piece of work. It took me into August. I got all the jewelry back, hung it on an interior decorator's assistant with proof, billed her for thirty- five hundred gross, and collected.


August. I had drawn no pay from Wolfe's checkbook since May sixth, I
had not gone near my personal safe deposit box, and my personal bank balance had not only not sunk, it had lifted. I decided I had a vacation coming. The most I had ever been able to talk Wolfe out of was two weeks, and I thought I should double that at least. A friend of mine, whose name has appeared in print in connection with one of Wolfe's cases, had the idea that we should take a look at Norway, and her point of view seemed sound.
==> Slow but sure, I was working myself around to an attitude toward life without Nero Wolfe on a permanent basis. One thing that kept it slow was the fact that early in July Marko Vukcic had asked me to bring him another check for five grand drawn to cash. Since if you wanted to eat in his restaurant you had to reserve a table a day in advance, and then pay six bucks for one helping of guinea hen, I knew he wasn't using it himself, so who was? Another thing, the house hadn't been sold, and, doing a little snooping on my own account, I had learned that the asking price was a hundred and twenty thousand, which was plain silly. On the other hand, if Marko was getting money to Wolfe, that didn't prove that I was ever going to see him again, and there was no hurry about selling the house until the bank balance began to sag; and also there was Wolfe's safe deposit box. Visiting his safe deposit box was one item on the select list of purposes for which Wolfe had been willing to leave his house. <==
I did not really want to leave New York, especially to go as far as Norway. I had a feeling that I would about be passing Sandy Hook when word would come somehow, wire or phone or letter or messenger, to 35th Street or 1019, in a code that I would understand - if I was there to get it. And if it did come I wanted to be there, or I might be left out of the biggest charade Wolfe had ever staged. But it hadn't been days or weeks, it had been months, and my friend was pretty good at several things, including riding me about hanging on forever to the short end of the stick, so we had reservations on a ship that sailed August twenty-sixth.
Four days before that, August twenty-second, a Tuesday afternoon, I was sitting at my desk at 1019, to keep an appointment with a man who had phoned. I had told him I was soon leaving for a month's vacation, and he hadn't felt like giving a name, but I thought I recognized the voice and had agreed to see him. When he walked in on the dot, at 3:15,I was glad to know that my memory for voices was holding up. It was my old cellmate, Max Christy.
I got up and we shook. He put his panama on the desk and glanced around. His black mop was cut a little shorter than it had been in April, but the jungle of his eyebrows hadn't been touched, and his shoulders looked just as broad in gray tropical worsted. I invited him to sit and he did.

 brass in the circles that Max Christy moved in. This bird was a complete stranger. With more skin supplied for his face than was needed, it had taken up the slack in pleats and wrinkles, and that may have accounted for his sporting a pointed brown beard, since it must be hard to shave pleats.
As the car crossed the avenue and continued west, I told him, "I came to oblige Max Christy - if suggestions might help any. I'll only be around till Saturday."
He said, "My name's Roeder," and spelled it.
I thanked him for the confidence. He broadened it. "I'm from the West Coast, in case you wonder how I rate. I followed something here and found it was tied in with certain operations. I'd just as soon leave it to local talent and go back home, but I'm hooked and I have to stick." Either he preferred talking through his nose or that was the only way he knew. "Christy told you we want a man tailed?"
"Yes. I explained that I'm not available."
==> "You have got to be available. There's too much involved." He was twisted around to face me. "It'll be harder than ever now, because he's on guard. It's been messed up. They say if anyone can do it you can, especially with the help of a couple of men that Nero Wolfe used. You can get them, can't you?" <==
"Yeah, I can get them, but I can't get me. I won't be here."
'"You're here now. You can start tomorrow. As Christy told you, five Cs a day. It's a straight tailing job, where you're working for a man named Roeder from Los Angeles. The cops might not like it too well if you tied in with a local like Wilts or Brownie Costigan, but what's wrong with me? You never heard of me before. You're in business as a private detective. I want to hire you, at a good price, to keep a tail on a man named Rackham and report to me on his movements. That's all, a perfectly legitimate job."
We had crossed Park Avenue. The light was dim enough that I didn't have to be concerned about my face showing a reaction to the name Rackham. The reaction inside me was my affair.
"How long would it last?" I inquired.
"I don't know. A day, a week, possibly two."

"Forget it. If that's the kind of interest you've got in Rackham you wouldn't tell me anyhow. But another thing: Rackham knows me. It's twice as hard to tail a guy that knows you. Why hire a man that's handicapped to begin with? Why not - "
I held it because we had stopped for a red light, on Fifth Avenue in the Seventies, and our windows were open, and the open window of a car alongside was only arm's distance away.
When the light changed and we rolled again Roeder spoke. "I'll tell you, Goodwin, this thing's touchy. There'll be some people scattered around that are in on things together, and they trust each other up to a point. As long as their interests all run the same way they can trust each other pretty well. But when something comes up that might help some and hurt others, then it gets touchy. Then each man looks out for himself, or he decides where the strength is and lines up there. That's where I am, where the strength is. But I'm not trying to line you up; we wouldn't want to even if we could; how could we trust you? You're an outsider. All we want you for is an expert tailing job, and you report to me and me only. Where are you going. Bill?"
The driver half-turned his head to answer, "Here in the park it might be cooler."
"It's no cooler anywhere. I like straight streets. Get out again, will you?"
==> The driver said he would, in a hurt tone. Roeder returned to me. "There are three men named Panzer, Gather, and Durkin who worked for Nero Wolfe off <==

 and on. That right?"
I said it was.
"They'll work for you, won't they?"
I said I thought they would.

"Saul Panzer is the best man alive. Gather and Durkin are way above
average."
"That's all you'll need. Now I want to ask you something, but first here's a
remark. It's a bad thing to mislead a client, I'm sure you realize that, but in this case it would be worse than bad. I don't have to go into details, do I?"
"No, but you're going too fast. I haven't got a client."
==> "Oh, yes, you have." Roeder smiled. "Would I waste my time like this? You were there when Mrs. Rackham was killed, you phoned Nero Wolfe <==
and in six hours he was gone, and you were held as a material witness. Now here I want to hire you to tail Rackham, and you don't know why. Can you say no? Impossible."
"It could be," I suggested, "that I've had all I want."
"Not you, from what I've heard. That's all right, not being able to let go is a good thing in a man, but it brings up this question I mentioned. You're on your own now apparently, but you were with Nero Wolfe a long time. You're still living in his house. Of course you're in touch with him - don't bother to deny it - but that's no concern of ours as long as he doesn't get in the way. Only on this job it has to be extra plain that you're working for the man who pays you. If you get facts about Rackham and peddle them elsewhere, to Nero Wolfe for example, you would be in a very bad situation. Perhaps you know how bad?"
"Sure, I know. If I were standing up my knees would give. Just for the record, I don't know where Mr. Wolfe is, I'm not in touch with him, and I'm in no frame of mind to peddle him anything. If I take this on, tailing Rackham, it will be chiefly because I've got my share of monkey in me. I doubt if Mr. Wolfe, wherever he is, would recognize the name Rackham if he heard it."
The brown pointed beard waggled as Roeder shook his head. "Don't over - play it, Goodwin."

"Yeah, I am. Wait till Fritz sees you."
"If he ever does," Wolfe said grimly. "We have a chance, and that's all. If
all we needed were evidence of Zeck's complicity in felonies, there would be no problem; I know where it is and I could get it. But his defenses are everywhere, making him next to invulnerable. It would be fatuous to suppose that he could ever be convicted, and even if he were, he would still be living, so that wouldn't help any. Now that I am committed against him, and he knows it, there are only two possible outcomes - "
"How does he know it?"
"He knows me. Knowing me, he knows that I intend to get the murderer of Mrs. Rackham. He intends to prevent me. Neither - "
==> "Wait a minute. Admitting he knows that about Nero Wolfe, what about you as Roeder? You say you're a D. Then you're on Zeck's payroll." <==
"Not on his payroll. I have been placed in charge of the operation here of the device which I conceived and used in Los Angeles. My handling of it has so impressed him that I am being trusted with other responsibilities."
"And Max Christy and that driver downstairs - they're Zeck men?" "Yes - at a distance."
"Then how come salting Barry Rackham? Wasn't it Zeck money that

 Rackham was getting?"

"I'll make it a dollar ten an hour. The man will call you Lily, and you will call him Pete. Joining him in the car and riding up to your place, you need not go to extremes, but it is important for the driver to get the idea that you are mighty glad to see Pete and that you are looking forward with pleasure to the next several hours with him. But - "
"Is it a reunion after a long absence?"
"I'll make it a dollar twenty an hour. I was about to say, you can leave it vague whether you last saw Pete a week ago or two months ago. You're just glad to be with him because you're so fond of him, but don't get thinking you're Paulette Goddard and ham it. Do it right. Pretend it's me. Which brings me to the crux. It's going to be an ordeal for you. Wait till you see Pete."

"Everything. He's old enough to be your father and then some. He has whiskers, turning gray. His face is pleated. You will have to fight down the feeling that you're having a nightmare, and - "

Goddam a woman anyhow. There was absolutely no sense or reason for it. My brain buzzed.
"Sure," I said admiringly. "You do it with mirrors. If it was him, the way I feel about him, the first thing I would do would be to get him a date with you, huh? Okay, then don't call him Pete, call him Nero."
"Then who is it?"
"It's a man named Pete Roeder, and I've got to have a long talk with him that won't get in the papers."
"We could take him to Norway."

at the door of Lily's penthouse apartment on East 63rd Street.
Wolfe didn't speak and wouldn't look at me. Lily shook hands with me, a
form of greeting we hadn't used for I don't know how long, then unlocked the door, and we entered. When her wrap and Wolfe's hat had been disposed of and we passed to the living room, she tossed her firecracker.
"Archie," she said, "I knew darned well that something would happen some day to make up for all the time I've wasted on you, I just felt it would."
I nodded. "Certainly. You'll show a profit on the night even if you feed us sandwiches, especially since Pete is a light eater. He's on a diet."
==> "Oh," she said, "I didn't mean money, and you can go the limit on sandwiches. I meant the distinction you've brought me. I'm the only woman in America who has necked with Nero Wolfe. Nightmare, my eye. He has a flair." <==
Wolfe, who had seated himself, cocked his head to frown at her - a first- rate performance.
I smiled at her. "I told Pete what you said on the phone, and he was flattered. Okay, woman of distinction."
She shook her head. "Turn loose, my brave fellow. I've got hold of it."
She moved to Wolfe, looking down at him. "Don't be upset, Pete. I wouldn't have known you from Adam, no one would; that wasn't it. It's my hero here. Archie's an awful prude. He has been up against some tough ones, lots of them, and not once has he ever called on me to help. Never! A proud prude. Suddenly he calls me away from revelry - I might have been reveling for all he knew - to get into a car and be intimate with a stranger. There's only one person on earth he would do that for: you. So if I was pretty ardent in the car, I knew what I was doing. And don't worry about me - whatever you're up to, my lips are sealed. Anyway, to me you will always be Pete. The only woman in America

==>  who has necked with Nero Wolfe - my God, I'll treasure it forever. Now I'll go make some sandwiches. What kind of a diet are you on?" <==
Wolfe said through his teeth, "I care for nothing." "That can't be. A peach? Grapes? A leaf of lettuce?" "No!"
"A glass of water?"
"Yes!"
She left the room, leering at me as she went by. In a moment the sound of her movements in the kitchen came faintly.
I told Wolfe offensively, "It was you who said we needed a woman."

comfortable?" "No."
"Listen anyway. I'm taking Zeck's money and I'm crossing him. How do you know I won't cross you?"
"I don't. But I'll top him."

Zeck can guess and you can guess. Do I make myself clear?"
"I don't know. Are you just warning me not to trust you? Is that it?" "Well, yes."
"Then save your breath. I've never trusted anybody since I started shaving.

"He may be in a different department from the one you were in. He did name Zeck. He said - "
"He actually named Zeck?"
"Yes."
"To you? That's remarkable. Why?"
"I don't know, but I can guess. I had previously been tapped by Max
==> Christy, some time ago, and I think they've got an idea that I may have it in me to work up to an executive job - now that Nero Wolfe is gone. And they figure I must know that Christy plays with Brownie Costigan, and that Costigan is close to the top, so why not mention Zeck to me to make it glamorous? Anyhow, Roeder did. He said that what they wanted was a tail on you. They wanted it good and tight. They offered extra good pay. I was to use as many men as necessary. I took the job, got the men, and we started a week ago yesterday. Christy comes to my office every day for the reports. You know what's been in them; you know where you've been and what you've done." <==
Rackham was still frowning. "That's all there is to it?"
"That's the job as I took it and as I've handled it."
"You weren't told why?"
"In a way I was. I gathered that they think you might be a bad influence on
the District Attorney, and they want to be sure you don't start associating with him. If you do they would probably make a complaint. I suppose you know what their idea is of making a complaint."

I shook my head. "I can't see it with that background. But listen to this. Roeder came up to my office and stayed an hour, and do you know what he spent most of it doing? Asking me questions about the evening of April eighth! What has that got to do with my handling a tailing job? Nothing!
Why should they be interested in April eighth at all? I think they brought me this job, at double pay, just to start a conversation with me and soften me up. It has already been hinted that Zeck might like to meet me. I think that to frame you for murder they've got to have first-hand dope from someone who was there, and I'm elected. I think they're probably sizing me up, to decide whether I'm qualified to be asked to remember something that happened that night which has

 slipped my mind up to now, at a nice juicy price." I turned my palms up. "It's just a guess."
He still had nothing to say. His blood had apparently eased up a little. He was staring at my face, but I doubted if he was seeing it.
==> "If you care to know why I wanted you to hear it," I went on, "you can have that too. I have my weak spots, and one of them is my professional pride. It got a hard blow when Nero Wolfe scooted instead of staying to fight it out, with your wife's check for ten grand deposited barely in time to get through before she was croaked. If the ten grand is returned to her estate, who gets it? You. And it could be that you killed her. I prefer to leave it where it is and earn it. Among other things, she was killed while I was there, and I helped find the body. That's a fine goddam mess for a good detective, and I was thinking I was one." <==
He found his tongue. "I didn't kill her. I swear to you, Goodwin, I didn't kill her."
"Oh, skip it. Whether you did or didn't, not only do I not want to help frame you, I don't want anyone to frame anybody, not on this one. I've got a personal interest in it. I intend to earn that ten grand, and I don't want Zeck to bitch it up by getting you burned, even if you're the right one, on a fix. Therefore I wanted you to know about this. As I told you, I haven't got it spelled out, it's only a guess with background, and I admit it may be a bum one. What do you think? Am I hearing noises?"
Rackham picked up his drink, which hadn't been touched, took a little sip, about enough for a sparrow, and put it down again. He sat a while, licking his lips. "I don't get you," he said wistfully.
"Then forget it. You're all paid up. I've been known to guess wrong before."
"I don't mean that, I mean you. Why? What's your play?"

Much as he disliked publicity, his picture had been in the paper a few

 times, as for instance the occasion of his presenting his yacht to the United States Coast Guard during the war. Also I had heard him described. I had a good view of him at ten feet when I sat in one of the pinkish gray leather chairs near his desk. Actually there was nothing to him but his forehead and eyes. It wasn't a forehead, it was a dome, sloping up and up to the line of his faded thin hair. The eyes were the result of an error on the assembly line. They had been intended for a shark and someone got careless.
They did not now look the same as shark eyes because Arnold Zeck's brain had been using them to see with for fifty years, and that had had an effect.
"I've spoken with you on the phone," he said.
==> I nodded. "When I was with Nero Wolfe. Three times altogether - no, I guess it was four." <==
"Four. Where is he? What has happened to him?"
"I'm not sure, but I suspect he's in Florida, training with an air hose, preparing to lay for you in your swimming pool and get you when you dive."
There was no flicker of response, of any kind, in the shark eyes. "I have been told of your habits of speech, Goodwin," he said. "I make no objection. I take men for what they are or not at all. It pleases me that, impressed as you must be by this meeting, you insist on being yourself. But it does waste time and words. Do you know where Wolfe is?"
"No."
"Have you a surmise?"

"He wouldn't believe me when I said I didn't know where Wolfe was. He
thought Wolfe and I were fixing to try to bring you down, and he was just telling me. I told him that maybe he would like to pull us off because he was personally interested, but that since Wolfe had scooted he was wasting it."
"That was injudicious, wasn't it?"

Regarding my notion that you want to use me to find Nero Wolfe, skip it. You couldn't anyway, since I don't know whether he went north, east, south, or west." <==


I had once remarked to Wolfe, when X (our name then for Zeck) had
brought a phone call to a sudden end, that he was an abrupt bastard. He now abruptly turned the shark eyes from me, which was a relief, to reach for the switch on an intercom box on his desk, flip it, and speak to it. "Send Roeder in."
"Tell him to shave first," I suggested, thinking that if I had a reputation for a habit of speech I might as well live up to it. Zeck did not react. I was beginning to believe that he never had reacted to anything and never would.

"Sit down," Zeck said. "You know Goodwin."
Roeder nodded and favored me with a look. Sitting, he told me, "Your reports haven't been worth what they cost."
It gave me a slight shock, but I don't think I let it show. I had forgotten that Roeder talked through his nose.
"Sorry," I said condescendingly. "I've been sticking to facts. If you want them dressed up, let me know what color you like."
"You've been losing him."
==> I flared up quietly. "I used to think," I said, "that Nero Wolfe expected too much. But even he had brains enough to know that hotels have more than one exit." <==
"You're being paid enough to cover the exits to the Yankee Stadium." Zeck said, in his hard, cold, precise voice that never went up or down, "These are trivialities. I've had a talk with Goodwin, Roeder, and I sent for
you because we got to Rackham. We have to decide how it is to be handled and what part Goodwin is to play. I want your opinion on the effect of Goodwin's telling Rackham that he is working for Mrs. Frey."
Roeder shrugged. "I think it's unimportant. Goodwin's main purpose now is to get Rackham scared. We've got to have him scared good before we can expect him to go along with us. If he killed his wife - "
"He did, of course. Unquestionably."
"Then he might be more afraid of Mrs. Frey than of you. We can see. It not, it will be simple for Goodwin to give him a new line." Roeder looked at me. "It's all open for you to Rackham now?"

The shark eyes left me. "What's your opinion of Goodwin, Roeder? Can you work with him?"
Roeder had closed the brief case and kept it on his lap. "I can try," he said, not enthusiastically. "The general level here is no higher than on the coast. But we can't get started until we know whether we have Rackham or not, and the approach through Goodwin does seem the best way. He's so damned cocky I don't know whether he'll take direction."
"Would you care to have my opinion of Roeder?" I inquired.
Zeck ignored it. "Goodwin," he said, "this is the most invulnerable organization on earth. There are good men in it, but it all comes to me. I am the organization. I have no prejudices and no emotions. You will get what you deserve. If you deserve well, there is no limit to the support you will get, and none to the reward. If you deserve ill, there is no limit to that either. You understand that?"
"Sure." His eyes were the hardest to meet in my memory. "Provided you understand that I don't like you."
==> "No one likes me. No one likes the authority of superior intellect. There was one man who matched me in intellect - the man you worked for, Nero Wolfe - but his will failed him. His vanity wouldn't let him yield, and he cleared out." <==
"He was a little handicapped," I protested, "by his respect for law."
"Every man is handicapped by his own weaknesses. If you communicate with him give him my regards. I have great admiration for him."
Zeck glanced at a clock on the wall and then at Roeder. "I'm keeping a caller waiting. Goodwin is under your direction, but he is on trial. Consult me as necessary within the routine."
He must have had floor buttons for foot-signaling, for he touched nothing with his hands, but the door opened and the sentinel appeared.
Zeck said, "Put Goodwin on the B list, Schwartz."

Satisfied, she released it. "Barry and I had been friendly, a little, before Mrs. Rackham's death. Nothing but just a little friendly. That's all it meant to me, or I thought it was, and I thought it was the same with him. That's how it was when we went to the country for the Easter weekend. She had told me we wouldn't do any work there, answer any mail or anything, but Saturday at noon she sent for me to come to her room. She was crying and was so distressed she could hardly talk."
Lina paused. She was keeping her eyes straight at mine. "I can rattle this off now, Mr. Goodwin. I've already told it now."
"That always makes it easier," I agreed. "Go right ahead."
She did. "Mrs. Rackham said she had to talk about it with someone, and she wanted to with her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Frey, but she just couldn't, so there

==>  was only me. She said she had gone to see Nero Wolfe the day before, to ask him to find out where her husband was getting money from, and he had agreed to do it. Mr. Wolfe had phoned her that evening. Friday evening, and told her that he had already partly succeeded. He had learned that her husband was connected with something that was criminal. He was helping somebody with things that were against the law, and he was getting well paid for it. Mr. Wolfe advised her to keep it to herself until he had more details. He said his assistant, Mr. Goodwin, would come up Saturday afternoon, and might have more to report then." <==
"And that Goodwin knew all about it?" Archer asked.
"Well, naturally she took that for granted. She didn't say that Mr. Wolfe told her in so many words that Mr. Goodwin knew all about it, but if he was his assistant and helping with it, naturally she would think so. Anyway that didn't seem to be important then, because she had told it all to her husband. They used the same bedroom at Birchvale, and she said that after they had gone to bed she simply couldn't help it. She didn't tell me their conversation, what they said to each other, but they had had a violent quarrel. She had told him they would have to separate, she was through with him, and she would have Mr. Wolfe go on with his investigation and get proof of what he had done. Mrs. Rackham had a very strong character, and she hated to be deceived. But the next day she wasn't sure she really meant it, that she really wanted to part from him. That was why she wanted to talk about it with someone. I think the reason she didn't want to talk with Mrs. Frey - "
"If you don't mind, Miss Darrow," Archer suggested gently, "just the facts now."
"Yes, of course." She sent him a glance and returned to me. "I told her I thought she was completely wrong. I said that if her husband had been untrue to her, or anything like that, that would be different, but after all he hadn't done wrong to her, only to other people and himself, and that she should try to help him instead of destroying him. At the very least, I said, she should wait until she knew all the details of what he had done. I think that was what she wanted to hear, but she didn't say so. She was very stubborn. Then, that afternoon, I did something that I will regret all my life. I went to Barry and told him she had told me about it, and said I was sure it would come out all right if he would meet her halfway - tell her the whole thing, tell her he was sorry, as he certainly should be - and no more foolishness in the future. And Barry said he loved me."
She weakened a little there for the first time. She dropped her eyes. I had been boring at her with as steady and sharp a gaze as I had in me, but up to that point she had met it full and fair.

"Why not?"
"Because I didn't think it would be fair to Barry. I didn't think he had killed her, and I didn't know what criminal things he had helped with, and I thought it wouldn't be fair to tell that about him when all I knew was what Mrs. Rackham had told me." The fine eyes flashed for the first time. "Oh, I know the next part. Then why am I telling it now? Because I know more about him now - a great deal more! I don't know that he killed Mrs. Rackham, but I know he could have; he is cruel and selfish and unscrupulous - there is nothing he wouldn't do. I suppose you think I'm vindictive, and maybe I am, but it doesn't matter what you think about me as long as I'm telling the truth. What the criminal things were that he did, and whether he killed his wife - I don't know anything about it; that's your part."
"Not mine, sister. I'm not a cop."
She turned to the others. "Yours, then!"
This would have been a good moment for me to take time out to read my
==> signed statement, since I could have used a few minutes for some good healthy thinking. Here was a situation that was new to me. About all that Barry Rackham's ticket to the electric chair needed was my endorsement, and I thought he had it coming to him. All I had to do was tell the truth. I could say that I had no knowledge whatever of the phone call Nero Wolfe was purported to have made to Mrs. Rackham, but that it was conceivable that he had made such a call without mentioning it to me, since he had often withheld information from me regarding his actions and intentions. You couldn't beat that for truth. In various occasions I had used all my wits to help pin it on a murderer, and here it would take no wit at all, merely tossing in a couple of facts. But if I let it go at that, it was a cinch that before the sun went down Rackham would be locked up, and that would ruin everything. The program sunk, the months all wasted, the one <==

 chance gone, Zeck sailing on with the authority of his superior intellect, and Wolfe and me high and dry. My wits had a new job, and quick. I liked to think that they had done their share once or twice in getting a murderer corralled; now it was up to them to do more than their share in keeping a murderer running loose and free to keep appointments. Truth was not enough. There was no time to draw a sketch and see how I liked it. All three of them were looking at me, and Archer was saying, "You can see, Goodwin, why I wanted you to read your statement and see if you left anything out."
"Yeah." I was regretful. "I can also see you holding your breath, and I don't blame you. If I now say that's right, I forgot, Wolfe did phone Mrs. Rackham that Friday evening and tell her that, you've got all you need and hallelujah - I would love to help out, but I like to stick to the truth as far as practical."
"The truth is all I'm asking for. Did you call on Rackham at his apartment yesterday afternoon?"
That punch had of course been telegraphed. "Yes," I said.

"His pulse is all right," Roeder said, not through his nose.
"You're crazy," Rackham said hoarsely. "Good God! You're crazy!" He was out of his chair, standing there in front of it, trembling all over.
Roeder 's hand went to his side pocket for the Carson Snub Thirty, which he had got from the brief case along with the piece of cord. I took it and aimed it at Rackham.
"Sit down." I said. "and stay."
He sank down into the chair. I moved to the end of the desk so as to have him in a corner of my eye while looking at Zeck. Roeder, at my left elbow, spoke rapidly but distinctly.
==> "Mr. Zeck," he said, "you told me on the telephone two years ago that you had great admiration for me. I hope that what has just happened here has increased it. I'm Nero Wolfe, of course. There are many things it would give me satisfaction to say to you, and perhaps I shall some day, but not now. It is true that if one of your men suddenly opened the door Mr. Goodwin would kill you first, but I'm afraid you'd have company. So I'll get on. Having by your admission matched you in intellect, it's a question of will, and mine has not failed me, as you thought. Confound it, I wish you could speak." <==
The expression of Zeck's eyes, no longer popping, indicated that Wolfe had nothing on him there.
"Here's the situation," Wolfe went on. "During the two months I've been here in this outlandish guise I have collected enough evidence to get you charged on thirty counts under Federal law. I assure you that the evidence is sound and sufficient, and is in the hands of a man whom you cannot stop or deflect. You'll have to take my word for it that if that evidence is produced and used you are done for, and that it will be immediately produced and used if anything untoward happens to Mr. Goodwin or me. I fancy you will take my word since you admit that I match you in intellect, and to climax these five frightful months with such a bluff as this, if it were one, would be witless. However, if you think I'm bluffing there's no point in going on. If you think I'm bluffing, please shake your head no, meaning you don't believe me."
No shake.
"If you think I have the evidence as described, please nod your head."
No nod.

 somewhere that Wolfe, during his association with Zeck, might have collected some facts that could be embarrassing to people who shouldn't be embarrassed, the attitude toward us changed for the better right away.
As for the scene that ended with the death of Zeck and Rackham, we were clean as a whistle. The papers in Roeder's brief case, which of course the cops took, proved nothing on anybody. By the time the cops arrived there had been no one on the premises but Wolfe and me and the two corpses. A hot search was on, especially for Schwartz and Harry, but so far no take. No elaborate lying was required; our basic story was that Wolfe, in his disguise as Roeder, had got in with Zeck in order to solve the murder of Mrs. Rackham, and the climax had come that afternoon when Zeck had put the screws on Rackham by saying that he had evidence that would convict him for killing his wife, and Rackham had pulled a gun, smuggled somehow past the sentinels, and had shot Zeck, and Schwartz and Harry had rushed in and drilled Rackham. It was surprising and gratifying to note how much of it was strictly true.
So by Friday afternoon we were cleaned up with Westchester, as I thought, and therefore it was a minor shock when Wolfe said, "No, confound it, I still have to earn that fee."
I was opening my mouth to ask him how come, when the phone rang.
I got it. It was Annabel Frey. She wanted to speak to Wolfe. I told him so. He frowned and reached for his phone, and I stayed on.
==> "Yes, Mrs. Frey? This is Nero Wolfe." <==
"I want to ask you a favor, Mr. Wolfe, That is, I expect to pay for it of course, but still it's a favor. Could you and Mr. Goodwin come up here this evening? To my home, Birchvale?"
"I'm sorry, Mrs. Frey, but it's out of the question. I transact business only in my office. I never leave it."
That was a little thick, I thought, from a guy who had just spent five months the way he had. And if she read newspapers she knew all about it - or anyhow some.
"I'm sorry," she said, "because we must see you. Mr. Archer is here, the District Attorney, and I'm calling at his suggestion. We have a problem - two problems, really."
"By 'we' do you mean you and Mr. Archer?"

t seems to me," Wolfe told her, "that Mr. Leeds had one good idea - asking him. Have you tried that yourself?"
"Certainly. Long ago. He told me that an investment he had made was doing well."
"Maybe it was. Why not?"
"Not with my husband." She was positive. "I know how he is with money. It isn't in him to make an investment. Another thing: he is away more now. I don't know where he is as much as I used to. I don't mean weeks or even days, just an afternoon or evening - and several times he has had an appointment that he couldn't break when I wanted him to - "
Wolfe grunted, and she was at him. "I know! You think I feel that I've bought him and I own him! That's not it at all! All I really want is to be like a wife, just any wife - not beautiful and not ugly, not rich and not poor - just a wife! And hasn't a wife a right to know the source of her husband's income - isn't it her duty to know? If you had a wife wouldn't you want her to know?"
==> Wolfe made a face. "I can tell you, madam, what I don't want. I don't want this job. I think you're gulling me. You suspect that your husband is swindling you, either emotionally or financially, and you want me to catch him at it" He turned to me, "Archie. You'll have to change that formula. Hereafter, when a request comes for an appointment, do not say merely that we will not undertake to get divorce or separation evidence. Make it clear that we will not engage to expose a husband for a wife, or a wife for a husband, under any camouflage. May I ask what you are doing, Mrs. Rackham?" <==
She had opened her brown leather handbag and taken out a checkfold and a little gold fountain pen. Resting the checkfold on the bag, she was writing in it with the pen. Wolfe's question got no reply until she had finished writing, torn out the check, returned the fold and pen to the bag, and snapped the bag shut. Then she looked at him.
"I don't want you to expose my husband, Mr. Wolfe." She was holding the check with her thumb and fingertip. "God knows I don't! I just want to know. You're not ugly and afraid and neurotic like me, you're big and handsome and successful and not afraid of anything. When I knew I had to have help and my cousin couldn't do it, and I wouldn't go to anyone I knew, I went about it very carefully. I found out all about you, and no one knows I did, or at least why I

 did. If my husband is doing something that will hurt me that will be the end; but I don't want to expose him, I just have to know. You are the greatest detective on earth, and you're an honest man. I just want to pay you for finding out where and how my husband is getting money, that's all. You can't possibly say you won't do it. Not possibly!"
She left her chair and went to put the check on his desk in front of him.

She left her chair and went to put the check on his desk in front of him.
"It's for ten thousand dollars, but that doesn't mean I think that's enough. Whatever you say. But don't you dare say I want to expose him! My God - expose him?"
She had my sympathy up to a point, but what stuck out was her basic assumption that rich people can always get anything they want just by putting up the dough. That's enough to give an honest workingman, like a private detective for instance, a pain in three places. The assumption is of course sound in some cases, but what rich people are apt not to understand is that there are important exceptions. This, however, was not one of them, and I hoped Wolfe would see that it wasn't. He did. He didn't want to, but the bank account had by no means fully recovered from the awful blow of March fifteenth, only three weeks back, and he knew it. He came forward in his chair for a glance at the check, caught my eye and saw how I felt about it, heaved a sigh, and spoke.
==> "Your notebook, Archie. Confound it." <==
THE following morning, Saturday, I was in the office typing the final report on a case which I will not identify by name because it was never allowed to get within a mile of a newspaper or a microphone. We were committed on Mrs. Rackham's job, since I had deposited her check Friday afternoon, but no move had been made yet, not even a phone call to any of the names she had given us, because it was Wolfe's idea that first of all we must have a look at him. With Wolfe's settled policy of never leaving his house on business, and with no plausible excuse for getting Barry Rackham to the office, I would have to do the looking, and that had been arranged for.
Mrs. Rackham had insisted that her husband must positively not know or even suspect that he was being investigated, and neither must anyone else, so the arrangements for the look were a little complicated. She vetoed my suggestion

 that I should be invited to join a small weekend gathering at her country home in Westchester, on the ground that someone would probably recognize the Archie Goodwin who worked for Nero Wolfe. It was Calvin Leeds who offered an amendment that was adopted. He had a little place of his own at the edge of her estate, where he raised dogs, called Hillside Kennels. A month ago one of his valuable dogs had been poisoned, and I was to go there Saturday afternoon as myself, a detective named Archie Goodwin, to investigate the poisoning. His cousin would invite him to her place, Birchvale, for dinner, and I would go along.
It was a quiet Saturday morning in the office, with Wolfe up in the plant rooms as usual from nine to eleven, and I finished typing the report of a certain case with no interruptions except a couple of phone calls which I handled myself, and one for which I had to give Wolfe a buzz - from somebody at Mummiani's on Fulton Street to say that they had just got eight pounds of fresh sausage from Bill Darst at Hackettstown, and Wolfe could have half of it. Since Wolfe regards Darst as the best sausage maker west of Cherbourg, he asked that it be sent immediately by messenger, and for heaven's sake not with dry ice.

Since Wolfe regards Darst as the best sausage maker west of Cherbourg, he asked that it be sent immediately by messenger, and for heaven's sake not with dry ice.
When, at 11:00, the sound of Wolfe's elevator came, I got the big dictionary in front of me on my desk, opened to H, and was bent over it as he entered the office, crossed to his oversized custom-built chair, and sat. He didn't bite at once because his mind was elsewhere. Even before he rang for beer he asked, "Has the sausage come?"
Without looking up I told him no.
He pressed the button twice - the beer signal - leaned back, and frowned at me. I didn't see the frown, absorbed as I was in the dictionary, but it was in his tone of voice.
"What are you looking up?" he demanded.

"Any moment." Wolfe poured beer. "That raises the question of cloves again. What do you think?"
"I'm against it," Fritz said firmly.
Wolfe nodded. "I think I agree. I think I do. You may remember what Marko Vukcic said last year - and by the way, he must be invited for a taste of this. For Monday luncheon?"
"That would be possible," Fritz conceded, "but we have arranged for shad with roe - "
"Of course." Wolfe lifted his glass and drank, put it down empty, and used his handkerchief on his lips. That, he thought, was the only way for a man to scent a handkerchief. "We'll have Marko for the sausage at Monday dinner, followed by duck Mondor." He leaned forward and wiggled a finger.
==> "Now about the shallots and fresh thyme: there's no use depending on Mr. Colson. We might get diddled again. Archie will have to go - " <==
At that point Archie had to go answer the doorbell, which I was glad to do.
I fully appreciate, mostly anyhow, the results of Wolfe's and Fritz's pow-wows on grub when it arrives at the table, but the gab often strikes me as overdone. So I didn't mind the call to the hall and the front door. There I found a young man with a pug nose and a package, wearing a cap that said "Fleet Messenger Service." I signed the slip, shut the door, started back down the hall, and was met not only by Fritz but by Wolfe too, who can move well enough when there's something he thinks is worth moving for.
He took the package from me and headed for the kitchen, followed by Fritz and

 me.

 me.
The small carton was sealed with tape. In the kitchen Wolfe put it on the long table, reached to the rack for a knife, cut the tape, and pulled the flaps up. My reflexes are quick, and the instant the hissing noise started I grabbed Wolfe's arm to haul him back, yelling at Fritz, "Watch out! Drop!"

I arose, returned to the office on my feet, and told them. "Gas. Tear gas, I think. The hissing has stopped."
Wolfe snorted.
"No sausage," Fritz said grimly.
"If it had been a trigger job on a grenade," I told him, "there would have been plenty or sausage. Not for us, of us. Now it's merely a damn nuisance. You'd better sit here and chat a while."
I marched to the hall and shut the door behind me, went and opened the front door wide, came back and stood at the kitchen door and took a full breath, opened the door, raced through and opened the back door into the courtyard, and ran back again to the front. Even there the air current was too gassy for comfort, so I moved out to the stoop. I had been there only a moment when I heard my name called.
==> "Archie!" <==

I turned. Wolfe's head with its big oblong face was protruding from a window of the front room.
"Yes, sir," I said brightly.
"Who brought that package?"
I told him Fleet Messenger Service.

I did not, as a matter of fact, have anything to say except that it was a lousy break, and that didn't need saying. Wolfe had once ordered me to forget that I had ever heard the name Arnold Zeck, but whether I called him Zeck or Whosis or X, he was still the man who, some ten months ago, had arranged for two guys with an SM and a tommy gun to open up on Wolfe's plant rooms from a roof across the street, thereby ruining ten thousand dollars' worth of glass and equipment and turning eight thousand valuable orchid plants into a good start on a compost heap. That had been intended just for a warning.
Now he was telling us to lay off of Barry Rackham. That probably meant that without turning a finger we had found the answer to Mrs. Rackham's question - where was her husband getting his pocket money? He had got inside the circle of Arnold Zeck's operations, about which Wolfe had once remarked that all of them were illegal and some of them were morally repulsive. And Zeck didn't want any snooping around one of his men. That was almost certainly the sketch, but whether it was or not, the fact remained that we had run smack into Zeck again, which was fully as bad as having a gob of Darst sausage turn into a cylinder of tear gas.
"He likes to time things right, damn him," I complained. "He likes to make things dramatic. He had someone within range of this house to see the package being delivered, and when I left the front door open and then went and stood on the stoop that showed that the package had been opened, and as soon as he got the word he phoned. Hell, he might even - "
I stopped because I saw that I was talking to myself. Wolfe wasn't hearing me. He still sat gazing at the corner of the blotter. I shut my trap and sat and gazed at him. It was a good five minutes before he spoke.

==>  "Archie," he said, looking at me. <==
"Yes, sir."
"How many cases have we handled since last July?" "All kinds? Everything? Oh, forty."
"I would have thought more. Very well, say forty. We crossed this man's path inadvertently two years ago, and again last year. He and I both deal with crime, and his net is spread wide, so that may be taken as a reasonable expectation for the future; once a year, or in one out of every forty cases that come to us, we will run into him. This episode will be repeated." He aimed a thumb at the phone. "That thing will ring, and that confounded voice will presume to dictate to us. If we obey the dictate we will be maintaining this office and our means of livelihood only by his sufferance. If we defy it we shall be constantly in a state of trepidant vigilance, and one or both of us will probably get killed. Well?"
I shook my head. "It couldn't be made plainer. I don't care much for either one." "Neither do I."
"If you got killed I'd be out of a job, and if I got killed you might as well retire." I glanced at my wristwatch. "The hell of it is we haven't got a week to decide. It's twelve-twenty, and I'm expected at the Hillside Kennels at three o'clock, and I have to eat lunch and shave and change my clothes. That is, if I go. If I go?"

"I quite agree with him!' Hammond declared, "as you know. I'm not afraid to say so, either, because it shows the lengths I'll go to, to be with you. When you opened his kennel and he leaped out I could feel my hair standing up."
"I know," Annabel Frey said scornfully. "Duke knows too. I guess I'd better put him in." She left us, speaking to the dog, who abandoned his pose and trotted to her, and they disappeared around a corner of the building. There was a similarity in the movements of the two, muscular and sure and quick, but sort of nervous and dainty.
"Now we can relax," I told Hammond.
"I just can't help it," he said, irritated. "I'm not strong for dogs anyhow, and with these ..." He shrugged. "I'd just as soon go for a walk with a tiger."
Soon Annabel rejoined us, with a crack about Hammond's hair. I suggested that if they had something to do I could wait for Leeds without any help, but she said no.
==> "We only came to see you," she stated impersonally. "That is, I did, and Mr. Hammond went to the length of coming along. Just to see you, even if you are Archie Goodwin, I wouldn't cross the street; but I want to watch you work. So many things fall short of the build-up, I want to see if a famous detective does. I'm skeptical already. You look younger than you should, and you dress too well, and if you really thought that dog might jump you, you should have done something to - where did that come from? Hey!" <==
Sometimes I fumble a little drawing from my armpit, but that time it had been slick and clean. I had the barrel pointed straight up. Hammond had made a

 noise and an involuntary backward jerk.
I grinned at her. "Showing off. Okay? Want to try it? Get him and send him out from behind that same bush, with orders to take me, and any amount up to two bits, even, that he won't reach me." I returned the gun to the holster. "Ready?"
She blinked. "You mean you would?"

"Wait!" I commanded, and he halted. "But first get a doctor and call the police. Do that first. I'm going to your place. We left that knife in the dog, and someone might want it. Can't you put Hebe on guard here?"
He spoke, not to me but to Hebe. She came to him, a darting shadow, close to him. He leaned over to touch the shoulder of the body of Mrs. Barry Rackham and said, "Watch it, Hebe." The dog moved alongside the body, and Leeds, with nothing to say to me, went. He didn't leap or run, but he sure was gone. I called after him, "Phone the police before you kill anybody!" stepped to the trail, and headed for Hillside Kennels.
With the flashlight I had no trouble finding my way. This time, as I approached, the livestock barked plenty, and, hoping the kennel doors were all closed tight, I had my gun out as I passed the runs and the buildings. Nothing attacked me but noise, and that stopped when I had entered the house and dosed the door. Apparently if an enemy once got inside it was then up to the master.
Nobby was still there on the bench, and the knife was still in him. With only a glance at him in passing, I made for the little living room, where I had previously seen a phone on a table, fumed on a light, went to the phone, and got the operator and gave her a number. As I waited a look at my wristwatch showed me five minutes past midnight. I hoped Wolfe hadn't forgotten to plug in the line to his room when he went up to bed. He hadn't. After the ring signal had come five times I had his voice.
"Nero Wolfe speaking."
==> "Archie. Sorry to wake you up, but I need orders. We're minus a client. Mrs. Rackham. This is a quick guess, but it looks as if someone stabbed her with a knife and then stuck the knife in a dog. Anyhow, she's dead. I've just - " <==
"What is this?" It was almost a bellow. "Flummery?"
"No, sir. I've just come from where she's lying in the woods. Leeds and I found her. The dog's dead too, here on a bench. I don't - "
"Archie!"
"Yes, sir."
"This is insupportable. In the circumstances."

"Look, Theodore," I said, "I don't give a good goddam what you like or don't like. Mr. Wolfe has always pampered you because you're the best orchid nurse alive. This is as good a time as any to tell you that you remind me of sour

 milk. I do not know where Mr. Wolfe is nor if or when he's coming back. To you he sent his regards. To me he sent his very best regards and wishes. Now shut up."
I shifted to Fritz. "He thinks Marko Vukcic should pay you twice as much as he does. That's like him, huh? You can see I'm sore as hell, his doing it like this, but I'm not surprised. To show you how well I know him, this is what happened: not long after I phoned him last night he simply wrote these notes to us and walked out of the house, leaving the door open - you said you found it open - to show anyone who might be curious that there was no longer anyone or anything of any importance inside. You got up at your usual time, six-thirty, saw the open door, went up to his room, found his bed empty and the notes on the table. After going up to the plant rooms to call Theodore, you returned to his room, looked around, and discovered that he had taken nothing with him. Then you and Theodore stared at each other until I arrived. Have you anything to add to that?"
"I don't want to work on Long Island," Theodore stated.
==> Fritz only said, "Find him, Archie." <==
"He told me not to."
"Yes - but find him! Where will he sleep? What will he eat?"
I got up and went to the safe and opened it, and looked in the cash drawer,
where we always kept a supply for emergency expenses. There should have been a little over four thousand bucks; there was a little over a thousand. I closed the safe door and twirled the knob, and told Fritz, "He'll sleep and eat. Was my report accurate?"
"Not quite. One of his bags is gone, and pajamas, toothbrush, razor, three shirts, and ten pairs of socks."

"No."
"Any phone calls besides mine?"
"I don't know about yours. His extension and mine were both plugged in,
but you know I don't answer when you're out unless he tells me to. It rang only once, at eight minutes after twelve."
"Your clock's wrong. That was me. It was five after." I went and gave him a pat on the shoulder. "Okay. I hope you like your new job. How's chances for some breakfast?"
==> "But Archie! His breakfast ..." <==
"I could eat that too. I drove forty miles on an empty stomach." I patted

 him again. "Look, Fritz. Right now I'm sore at him, damn sore. After some griddle cakes and broiled ham and eight or ten eggs in black butter and a quart of coffee, we'll see. I think I'll be even sorer than I am now, but we'll see. Is there any of his favorite honey left that you haven't been giving me lately? The thyme honey?"
"Yes - some. Four jars."
"Good. I'll finish off with that on a couple of hot cakes. Then we'll see how I feel."

"We were going to repot some Miltonias today," Theodore said dismally.
I snorted. "Go ahead and pot 'em. He was no help anyhow. Beat it and let me alone. I've got to think. Also I'm hungry. Beat it!"
Theodore, mumbling, shuffled out. Fritz, following him, turned at the door. "That's it, Archie. Think. Think where he is while I get your breakfast."
He left me, and I sat down at my desk to do the thinking, but the cogs wouldn't catch. I was too mad to think. "Don't look for me." That was him to a T. He knew damn well that if I should ever come home to find he had vanished, the one activity that would make any sense at all would be to start looking for him, and here I was stopped cold at the take-off. Not that I had no notion at all. That was why I had left Leeds' place without notice and stepped it up to eighty-five getting back: I did have a notion. Two years had passed since Wolfe had told me, "Archie, you are to forget that you know that man's name. If ever, in the course of my business, I find that I am committed against him and must destroy him, I shall leave this house, find a place where I can work - and sleep and eat if there is time for it - and stay there until I have finished."
So that part was okay, but what about me? On another occasion, a year later, he had said to five members of a family named Sperling, in my presence, "In that event he will know it is a mortal encounter, and so will I, and I shall move to a base of operations which will be known only to Mr. Goodwin and perhaps two others." Okay. There was no argument with the mortal encounter or about the move. But I was the Mr. Goodwin referred to, and here I was staring at it - "Don't look for me." Where did that leave me? Certainly the two others he had had in mind were Saul Panzer and Marko Vukcic, and I didn't even dare to phone Saul and ask a couple of discreet questions; and besides, if he had let Saul in and left me out, to hell with him. And what was I supposed to say to people - for instance, people like the District Attorney of Westchester County?

That particular question got answered, partly at least, from an unexpected

 quarter. When I had finished with the griddle cakes, ham, eggs, thyme honey, and coffee, I went back to the office to see if I was ready to quit feeling and settle down to thinking, and was working at it when I became aware that I was sitting in Wolfe's chair behind his desk. That brought me up with a jerk. No one else, including me, ever sat in that chair, but there I was. I didn't approve of it. It seemed to imply that Wolfe was through with that chair for good, and that was a hell of an attitude to take, no matter how sore I was. I opened a drawer of his desk to check its contents, pretending that was what I had sat there for, and was starting a careful survey when the doorbell rang.

Going to answer it, I took my time because I had done no thinking yet and therefore didn't know my lines. Seeing through the one-way glass panel in the front door that the man on the stoop was a civilian stranger, my first impulse was to let him ring until he got tired, but curiosity chased it away and I opened the door. He was just a citizen with big ears and an old topcoat, and he asked to see Mr. Nero Wolfe. I told him Mr. Wolfe wasn't available on Sundays, and I was his confidential assistant, and could I help.

TODAY, APRIL 10, 1950
Mr. Wolfe will not hereafter be available. Inquiries from clients on

Beneath that was Wolfe's signature. It was authentic all right.
Having learned it by heart, I handed it back. "Yeah, thats okay. Sure. Give it a good spot."
"It's authentic?"
"Absolutely."

"I only wanted - "
"Skip it. I advise you to steer clear of me until I've had a chance to think." I went to the office and this time took my own chair. At least I had got
some instructions from Wolfe, though his method of sending them was certainly

 roundabout. The ad meant, of course, that I wasn't to try to cover his absence; on the contrary. More important, it told me to lay off of the Rackham thing. I was to handle inquiries from clients on unfinished matters, but only from clients; and since Mrs. Rackham, being dead, couldn't inquire, that settled that. Another thing - apparently I still had my job, unlike Fritz and Theodore. But I couldn't sign checks, I couldn't - suddenly I remembered something. The fact that I hadn't thought of it before indicates the state I was in. I have told, in my account of another case of Wolfe's how, in anticipation of the possibility that some day a collision with Arnold Zeck would drive him into a foxhole, he had instructed me to put fifty thousand dollars in cash in a safe deposit box over in Jersey, and how I obeyed instructions. The idea was to have a source of supply for the foxhole; but anyway, there it was, fifty grand, in the box rented by me under the name I had selected for the purpose. I was sitting thinking how upset I must have been not to have thought of that before when the phone rang and I reached for it.
==> "Nero Wolfe's office, Archie Goodwin speaking." <==
I thought it proper to use that, the familiar routine, since according to Wolfe's ad he wouldn't retire until the next day.
"Archie?" A voice I knew sounded surprised. "Is that you, Archie?" "Right. Hello, Marko. So early on Sunday?"
"But I thought you were away! I was going to give Fritz a message for
you. From Nero."

Marko Vukcic, owner and operator of Rusterman's Restaurant, the only
place where Wolfe really liked to eat except at home, was the only man in New York who called Wolfe by his first name. I told him I would be glad to take a message for myself.
"Not from Nero actually," he said. "From me. I must see you as soon as possible. Could you come here?"

I told Fritz I was going out and would be back when he saw me.
As I drove crosstown and up to 54th Street, I was around eighty per cent sure that within a few minutes I would be talking with Wolfe. For him it would be hard to beat that for a foxhole - the place that cooked and served the best food in America, with the living quarters of his best and oldest friend above it. Even after I had entered at the side door, as arranged, ascended the two flights of stairs, seen the look on Marko's face as he welcomed me, felt the tight clasp of his fingers as he took my hands in his, and heard his murmured "My friend, my poor young friend!" - even then I thought he was only preparing dramatically to

 lead me to Wolfe in an inner room.
But he wasn't. All he led me to was a chair by a window. He took another one, facing me, and sat with his palms on his knees, his head cocked a little to one side as usual.
==> "My friend Archie," he said sympathetically. "It is my part to tell you exactly certain things. But before I do that I wish to tell you a thing of my own. I wish to remind you that I have known Nero a much longer time than you have. We knew each other as boys in another country - much younger than you were that day many years ago when you first saw him and went to work for him. He is my old and dear friend, and I am his. So it was natural that he should come to me last night." <==
"Sure," I agreed. "Why not?"
"You must feel no pique. No courroux."
"Okay. I'll fight it down. What time did he come?"
"At two o'clock in the night. He was here an hour, and then left. That I am
to tell you, and these things. Do you want to write them down?"

"Did he say I should?"
"No, But why shouldn't you? That is my own thought, and it brings us to the fifth and last thing: the instructions Nero gave me for you."
"Oh, he did. That was thoughtful. Such as?"
"You are to act in the light of experience as guided by intelligence." He stopped. I nodded. "That's a cinch, I always do. And specifically?" "That's all. Those are your instructions." Marko upturned his palms. "That's all about everything."
"You call that instructions, do you?"
==> "I don't. He did." He leaned to me. "I told him, Archie, that his conduct <==
was inexcusable. He was standing ready to leave, after telling me those five things and no more. Having no reply, he turned and went: Beyond that I know nothing, but nothing,"
"Where he went? Where he is? No word for me at all?"
"Nothing. Only what I have told you."
"Hell, he's gone batty, like lots of geniuses," I declared, and got up to go.

"There's a Westchester man downtown. He's on his way up here to take you."

I shook my head. "I'll fight like a cornered rat. I know fourteen lawyers all told. Ten to one he has no papers. This is one of those brotherly acts which I do not like. You're on a spot. Sergeant."
"Don't scare me to death. If he has no papers I'll send you downtown and let them handle it."
"Yeah," I admitted, "that would let you out. But we can make it simpler for both of us if you care to. Get the Westchester DA on the phone and let me talk to him. I'll even pay for the call."
==> At first he didn't like the idea and then he did. I think what changed his mind was the chance of picking up a piece of hot gossip on the murder of the month. He had to be persuaded, but when I told him the DA would be at the Rackham place and gave him the number, that settled it. He put the call in. However, he covered. When he got the number he made it clear that he merely wanted to offer the DA an opportunity to speak to Archie Goodwin if he wished to. He did. I circled the railing to get to the desk and took the phone. <==
"Mr. Archer?"
"Yes! This is - "
"Just a minute!" I said emphatically. "Whatever you were going to say this
is, I double it. It's an outrage. It - "
"You were told to stay here, and you sneaked away! You left - "

We were on the chairs, with the little wooden table between us. It was comfortable enough except that there was no room to prop up our morning papers. He flattened his out, still open at sports, on the end of the cot, and turned to it while disposing of a bite of food. I arranged mine, front page, on my knee. In the picture of Mrs, Rackham the poor woman looked homelier than she had actually been, which was a darned shame even though she wasn't alive to see it. Wolfe's name and mine both appeared in the sub-heads under the three-column spread about the murder. I glanced at the bottom, followed the instruction to turn to page four, and there saw more pictures. The one of Wolfe was only fair,

king him look almost bloated, but the one of me was excellent. There was one of a Doberman pinscher standing at attention. It was captioned Hebe, which I doubted. The play in the text on Wolfe and me was on his sudden retirement from business and absence from the city, and on my presence at the scene of the murder and arrest as a material witness. There was also a report of an interview with Marko Vukcic, a Gazette exclusive, with Lon Cohen's by-line. I would have given at least ten to one that Lon had used my name in getting to Marko.
With the breakfast all down, including the coffee, which was pretty good, I was so interested in my reading that I didn't notice that my mate had finished with sports and proceeded to other current events. What got my attention was the feeling that I was being scrutinized, and sure enough I was. He was looking at me, and then at his page four, and back at me again.
I grinned at him. "Pretty good likeness, huh? But I don't think that's the right dog. I'm no expert, but Hebe isn't quite as slim as that."
==> He was regarding me with a new expression, not particularly matey. "So you're Nero Wolfe's little Archie." <==
"I was." I gestured. "Read the paper. Apparently I am now my own little Archie."
"So I bought a meal for a shamus."
"Not at all. Didn't I say it was on me when I get my wallet back?"
He shook his head. "I wouldn't have believed it. With them clothes? I
supposed you had got snagged in the raid on the Covered Porch. It gets worse all the time, the dicks. Look at this, even here in the can I meet a guy with a suit of clothes like that, and he's a dick!"

king him look almost bloated, but the one of me was excellent. There was one of a Doberman pinscher standing at attention. It was captioned Hebe, which I doubted. The play in the text on Wolfe and me was on his sudden retirement from business and absence from the city, and on my presence at the scene of the murder and arrest as a material witness.

"I am not a dick, strictly speaking." I was hurt. "I am a private eye. I said I liked the way you talk, but you're getting careless. I also noticed you were cultured, and that should have put me on my guard. Cultured people are not often found in the coop. But nowadays dicks are frequently cultured. They tossed me in here because they think I'm holding out on a murder, which I'm not, and the fact that it has been tried before doesn't mean they wouldn't try it again. Putting you in here with me wasn't so dumb, but you overplayed it, buying me a breakfast first pop. That started me wondering."

"All right, Wilkes. Coming." My mate stood up. "What about it, Goodwin?"
"I appreciate it," I said warmly. Wilkes, having unlocked the door, was standing there, and, using my judgment, I kept it discreet. "When I get out and look around a little I'll know better how things stand." I had got to my feet. "How do I get in touch with you?"
"Phone is best. Churchill five, three two three two. I'm not there much, but a message will reach me promptly. Better write it down."
"I'll remember it." I took his offered hand and we shook. "It's been a pleasure. Where can I mail a check for the breakfast?"
"Forget it. It was a privilege. Be seeing you, I hope." He strode out like an executive going to greet a welcome caller, Wilkes holding the door for him.
==> I sat down on the cot, thinking it was a hell of a note for a Max Christy to get sprung before an Archie Goodwin. What was keeping Parker? In jail a man gets impatient. <==

X
IT WAS seven o'clock that evening, just getting dark, when I left the car at the curb on West 35th Street in front of Wolfe's house and climbed the seven steps to the stoop. Parker, armed with papers which stated, among other things, that my continued availability to the People of the State of New York was worth ten thousand dollars, had arrived at the jail shortly after two, and in another ten minutes I had been unleashed on society again, but District Attorney Archer had requested another session with me in the presence of my attorney, and Parker and I had obliged. It had dragged on and on, and was really a bore, because there was nothing for me to try to be witty about. Unlike some other occasions when I had been in conference with the law, there was nothing to stimulate me because all I had to do was tell the truth, and all of it - except the sausage part and the phone call from Arnold Zeck.
When they had finally called it a day and Parker and I were standing on the sidewalk in front of the courthouse, he asked me, "Am I to know where Wolfe is?"
"I doubt it. He told me not to look for him."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34937    window = 34932 34942


His tone of voice irritated me. "Every word you heard me say in there," I
asserted, "was the truth. I haven't the thinnest idea where he is or what he's doing."
He shrugged. "I'm not complaining. I only hope he hasn't tumbled in where it's too deep this time - and you too."
"Go to hell," I advised him, and marched off. I couldn't really blame the Westchester bunch, but Parker should have known me well enough to tell which side of my mouth I was talking out of. It's damn discouraging, when you do tell the truth, not to have it recognized.
Also discouraging was the welcome I got on entering Wolfe's house that evening. It was in the form of a note stuck in the corner of my desk blotter, unfolded.
==> Dear Archie - <==
I am sorry you are in jail and hope it will not last long. Mr. Vukcic has been to see me and I am leaving now to go to work for him $1500 - There has been no word from Mr. Wolfe. God grant he is safe and well and I think you should find him no matter what he wrote. I threw out the jar of sardines and stopped the milk. My very best regards and wishes,

Fritz
1:35 PM
I was pleased to observe that he stuck to routine to the end, putting the time down. Also it was nice of him to end his note to me the same as Wolfe had ended his. Nevertheless, it was a discouraging welcome home after a night in the hoosegow. And there had been a period of more than five hours when any phone calls that might have come would not have been answered, something that had never happened before in all the years I had worked and lived there. Unless Theodore ...

My meal finished and things put away, I wandered into the dining room, office, front room, down to the basement to Fritz's room, up one flight to Wolfe's room, up another to my room. As I undressed for my post-jail bath, I thought that the hell of it wasn't how I felt, but that I didn't know how to feel. If I had actually seen the last of Nero Wolfe, it was a damn sad day for me, there were no two ways about that, and if I got a lump in my throat and somebody walked in I would just as soon show him the lump as not.
But what if it was Wolfe himself who walked in? That was the trouble. Damned if I was going to work up a fancy lump and then have him suddenly appear and start crabbing about something.
After I had bathed and shaved and got into clean pajamas, and answered a

 couple of phone calls from journalists, and moseyed down to the office and fooled around a while, someone did walk in. When I heard the front door open I made for the hall as if I had been expecting another package of sausage, and there was Fritz. He turned from closing the door, saw me, and beamed.
==> "Ah! Archie! You escaped?" <==
"I'm out on bail." He seemed to want to shake hands, and I was willing. "Thanks for your note. How's the new job?"
"Terrible. I'm played up. Mr. Wolfe?"
"I know nothing about Mr. Wolfe. I ate half a jar of pate."
He stopped beaming. "Mr. Vukcic is going to sell this house."
"He's going to offer it for sale, which is not the same thing."

"Perhaps not." He sighed. "I'm tired. Mr. Vukcic said there is no reason
why I should not sleep here but I should ask you. It would be good for me - I am so used to that room ..."
"Certainly. I'm used to mine too. I'm going to sleep here until further notice."
"Good." He started for the kitchen, stopped, and turned. "Are you going to look for him?"
"No!" Hearing myself shout, it seemed a relief and I did it again. "I am not!" I went to the stairs and started up. "Good night."
==> "Good night, Archie." <==
I was on the first landing when his voice came. "Ill get your breakfast! I don't have to leave until ten!"
"Swell!" I called back. "We'll never miss him!"
The next day, Tuesday, I had no time to raise a lump. There were dozens of phone calls, from newspapers, former clients, friends, and miscellaneous. One was from Calvin Leeds, asking me to go up there to see him, and I told him I had had enough of Westchester for a while. When he insisted, I agreed to receive him at the office at two o'clock. I took advantage of another call, from Lon Cohen at the Gazette, to ask about my recent cellmate, Max Christy. Lon asked why I wanted to know. Lon is a good guy, but no newspaperman on earth can answer the simplest question without asking you one first, and more if possible.
"Just curious," I told him. "I met him in jail over the weekend, and thought he was charming. I don't want a biography, just a line or two."
"For quotation?"

I let him lead the way to the office. This time I sat at my own desk. I was tempted to take Wolfe's chair again just to see how he would react, but it would have put me at a disadvantage, I was so used to dealing with him, in the red leather chair, from my own angle.
He eyed me. "So you're holding the fort," he growled.
"Not exactly," I objected. "I'm only the caretaker. Or maybe I'm going down with the ship. Not that those who have left are rats."
"Where's Wolfe?"
"I don't know. Next, you call me a liar. Then I say I have been, but not now. Then you - "
==> "Nuts. Where is he, Archie?" <==
That cleared the atmosphere. Over the years he had called me Goodwin fifty times to one Archie. He called me Archie only when he wanted something awful bad or when he had something wrapped up that Wolfe had given him and his humanity overcame him. So we were to be mellow.
"Listen," I said, friendly but firm. "That routine is all right for people like district attorneys and state cops and the representatives of the press, but you're above it. Either I don't know where he is, or I do know but I'm sitting on it. What's the difference? Next question."
He took a cigar from his pocket, inspected it, rubbed it between his palms, and inspected it again. "It must be quite a thing," he remarked, not growling. "That ad in the paper. The plants gone. Fritz and Theodore gone. Vukcic listing the house for sale. I'm going to miss it, I am, never dropping in to see him sitting there thinking he's smarter than God and all His angels. Quite a thing, it must be. What is it?"
I said slowly and wearily, "Either I don't know what it is, or I do know but

"I thought so. Next, the possibility that when you phoned Wolfe right after the body was found you told him something that gave him a line on the

 murderer, but it's tricky and he had to go outdoors to get his evidence, preparing to grandstand it for the front page. I told Dykes I would rule that out too. Wolfe is quite capable of a play like that, sure he is, but if that's all it amounted to, why move the plants out and put Frits to work in a restaurant and list the house for sale? He's colorful, but not that colorful. Mrs. Rackham only paid him ten thousand, about what I make a year. Why should he spend it having his orchids carted around?"
Cramer shook his head, "Not for my money. That leaves the third possibility: that something really did scare him. That there was something about Mrs. Rackham's murder, or anyhow connected with it, that he knew he couldn't handle sitting there in that chair, but for some reason he had to handle it. So he scooted. As you say, you either don't know where he is or you know and won't tell - and that's no help either way. Now I've got a lot to say about this possibility. You got time to listen?"
"I've got all day, but Fritz isn't here to get our lunch."
==> "We'll go without." He clasped his hands behind his head and shifted his center of gravity. "You know, Archie, sometimes I'm not as far behind as you think I am." <==
"Also sometimes I don't think you're as far behind as you think I do."
"That's possible. Anyhow, I can add. I think he got word direct from Arnold Zeck. Did he?"
"Huh? Who's Arnold Zeck? Did you just make it up?"
I knew that was a mistake the instant it was out of my mouth. Then I had to try to keep it from showing on my face, the realization that I had fumbled it, but whether that was a success or not - and I couldn't very well look in a mirror to find out - it was too late.
Cramer looked pleased. "So you've been around all these years, a working detective, meeting the people you do, and you've never heard of Arnold Zeck. Either I've got to believe that, or I touched a tender spot."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1039    window = 1034 1044

"I did. You may also remember that a year later, last summer, Wolfe's plant rooms got shot up from a roof across the street."
"Yep. I was sitting right here and heard it."
"So I understand. Since no one was killed that never got to me officially, but naturally I heard things. Wolfe had started to investigate a man named Rony, and Rony's activities were the kind that might lead a first-class investigator like Wolfe in the direction of Arnold Zeck, maybe up close to Zeck, possibly even clear to him. I thought then that Wolfe had got warned off, by Zeck himself or someone near him, and he had disregarded it, and for a second warning they messed up his orchids. Then Rony got killed, and that was a break for Wolfe because it put him and Zeck on the same side."
"Gosh," I remarked, "it sounds awful complicated to me."
"I'll bet it does." Cramer moved the cigar - getting shorter now, although he never lit one - to the other side of his mouth. "All I'm doing is showing you that I'm not just hoping for a bite, and I don't want to string it out. It was a good guess that Wolfe had jostled up against Arnold Zeck in both the Orchard case and the Rony case, and now what happens? Not long after Mrs. Rackham calls on him and hires him to check on her husband's income, someone sends him a cylinder of tear gas - not a bomb to blow out his guts, which it could have been, just tear gas, so of course it was for a warning. And that night Mrs. Rackham gets murdered. You tell him about it on the phone, and when you get home he's gone."
==> Cramer took the cigar from his mouth and pointed it at me. "I'll tell you what I believe, Archie. I believe that if Wolfe had stayed and helped, the murderer of Mrs. Rackham would be locked up by now. I believe that he had reason to think that if he did that, helped to catch the murderer, he would have to spend the rest of his life trying to keep Arnold Zeck from getting him. I believe that he decided that the only way out was for him to get Zeck. How's that?" <==
"No comment," I said politely. "If you're right you're right, and if you're wrong I wouldn't want to hurt your feelings."
"Much obliged. But he did get a warning from Zeck - the tear gas." "No comment."
"I wouldn't expect any. Now here's what I came for. I want you to give
Wolfe a personal message from me, not as a police officer but as a friend. This is between you and me - and him. Zeck is out of his reach. He is out of anybody's


[line number in individual story] matching line = 1049    window = 1044 1054

 reach. It's a goddam crime for an officer of the law to have to say a thing like that, even privately, but it's true. Here's a murder case, and thank God it's not mine. I'm not pointing at Ben Dykes or the DA up there, I'm not pointing at any person or persons, but if the setup is that Barry Rackham is tied in with one or more of Zeck's operations, and if Rackham killed his wife, I say he will never burn, I don't say at what point Zeck will get his hand in, or who or what he will use, but Rackham will never burn."
Cramer hurled his cigar at my wastebasket and missed it a foot. Since it wasn't lit I ignored it. "Hooray for justice," I cheered.
He snarled, but apparently not at me. "I want you to tell Wolfe that. Zeck is out of his reach. He can't get him."
"But," I objected, "granting that you've got it all straight, which I haven't, that's a hell of a message. Look at it from the other end. He is not out of Zeck's reach, not if he comes home. I know he doesn't go out much, but even if he never did people have to come in - and things, like packages of sausage. Not to mention that the damage they did to the plants and equipment last year came to thirty-eight thousand bucks. I get the idea that he is to lay off of Zeck, but that's only what he doesn't do. What does he do?"
==> Cramer nodded. "I know. That's it. He's so damn bullheaded. I want you to understand, Archie, why I came here. Wolfe is too cocky to live. He has enough brass and bluster to outfit a thousand sergeants. Sure, I know him; I ought to. I would love to bloody his nose for him, I've tried to often enough, and some day I will and enjoy it. But I would hate to see him break his neck on a deal like this where he hasn't got a chance. It's a good guess that in the past ten years there have been over a hundred homicides in this town that were connected in one way or another with one of the operations Arnold Zeck has a hand in. But not in a single case was there the remotest hope of tying Zeck up with it. We couldn't possibly have touched him." <==
"You're back where you started," I complained. "He can't be reached. So what?"
"So Wolfe should come back where he belongs, return what Mrs. Rackham paid him to her estate, let the Westchester people take care of the murder, which is their job anyhow, and go on as before. You can tell him I said that, but by God don't quote me around. I'm not responsible for a man like Zeck being out of reach."
"But you never strained a muscle stretching for him."
"Nuts. Facts are facts."
"Yeah, like sausage is tear gas." I stood up so as to look down my nose at

"Glad to. But speaking as the bookkeeper, what do I charge it to?"
"Why - expense."
"Speaking as a man who may some day have to answer questions from an
internal revenue snoop, whose expense and what kind?" "Call it travel expense."
"Travel by whom and to where?"
==> Marko made some kind of a French noise, or foreign at least, indicating impatience, I think. "Listen, Archie, I have a power of attorney without limit. Bring me a check for five thousand dollars at your convenience. I am stealing it from my old friend Nero to spend on beautiful women or olive oil." <==
So I was not entirely correct when I said that I got no word at all from Wolfe during those weeks and months, but you must admit it was pretty vague. How far a man gets on five grand, and where he goes, depends on so many things.
When I returned to the office from a morning walk on the third day of May, a Wednesday, and called the phone-answering service as usual, I was told there had been three calls but only one message - to ring a Mount Kisco number and ask for Mrs. Frey. I considered the situation, told myself the thing to do was skip it, and decided that I must be hard of hearing when I became aware that I had dialed the operator and asked for the number.
Then, after I had got it and spelled my name and waited a minute, Annabel Frey's voice was in my ear. At least the voice said it was her, but I wouldn't have recognized it. It was sort of tired and hopeless.
"You don't sound like you," I told her.
"I suppose not," she conceded. "It seems like a million years since you came that day and we watched you being a detective. You never found out who poisoned the dog, did you?"

Sincerely,
AG:hs
I read it over and signed it. It looked businesslike, I thought, with the
regulation initialing at the bottom, the "hs" being for "himself." When I left, after putting the stationery in a drawer and getting things in order for the rush of business on Monday morning, I dropped the envelope in the mail chute. I was doing it that way, instead of phoning her, for three reasons: if she had changed her mind she could just ignore it; I had a date, purely personal, for the weekend; and I had drawn myself a salary check, the last one, for that week. On my way home I made a detour to 54th Street, to tell Marko Vukcic what I had done, because I thought he should be the first to know.
He made it not only plain but emphatic that he disapproved. I told him, "Experience tells me that pants wear out quicker sitting down than moving around. Intelligence tells me that it's better to wait till you die to start to rot. I would appreciate it if you will convey that to him next time you write him or phone him."
==> "You know perfectly good, Archie, that - " <==
"Not perfectly good. Perfectly well."
"You know that I have said nothing, but nothing, that might make you
think I can write him or phone him."
"You didn't need to. I know it's not your fault, but where does it leave me?
Let me know any time you get a buyer for the house, and I'll move out."

I was not kidding myself that I had really cut loose, since I hadn't moved
my bed out, but the way I figured it a caretaker who is drawing no pay has a right to a room; and besides, Fritz was still sleeping there and we were splitting

 on the groceries for breakfast, and I didn't want to insult either him or my stomach by breaking that up.
I shall now have to specify when I say office - or, better, I'll say office when I mean Wolfe's office, and when I mean my Madison Avenue suite I'll say 1019. Monday morning, arriving at 1019 a little after ten, I rang the phone- answering service and was told that there had been no calls, and then dug into the morning mail, which consisted of a folder from a window-cleaning outfit. After giving it full consideration, I typed notes on my new stationery to some personal friends, and an official letter to the City of New York giving notice of my change of address as a licensed detective. I was sitting trying to think who else I might write to when the phone rang - my first incoming call.
==> I picked it up and told the transmitter plainly, "Archie Goodwin's office." "May I speak to Mr. Goodwin, please?" <==
"I'll see if he's in. Who is calling, please?"
"Mrs. Frey."
"Yes, he's in. This is me. You got my note?"
'It came this morning. I don't know what you mean about representing no one but yourself."
"I guess I didn't make it very clear. I only meant I wouldn't be acting as Nero Wolfe's assistant. I'm just myself now."

"It was not. But I was ready to return east, both physically and psychologically, and knowing that inquiries sent to Los Angeles would get a satisfactory response. I arrived on July twelfth. You remember that I once spoke of Arnold Zeck, calling him X, to the Spelling family?"
"I do."
"And I described briefly the echelons of crime. First, the criminal himself - or gang. In the problem of disposal of the loot, or of protection against discovery and prosecution, he can seldom avoid dealing with others. He will need a fence, a lawyer, witnesses for an alibi, a channel to police or political influence - no matter what, he nearly always needs someone or something. He goes to one he knows, or knows about, one named A. A, finding a little difficulty, consults B. B may be able to handle it; if not, he takes it on to C. C is usually able to oblige, but when he isn't he communicates with D. Here we are getting close. D has access to Arnold Zeck, not only for the purpose described, but also in connection with one or more of the enterprises which Zeck controls."
==> Wolfe tapped his chest with a forefinger, a gesture I had never before seen him use, acquired evidently along with his pleats and whiskers. "I am a D, Archie." <==
"Congratulations."
"Thank you. Having earned them, I accept them. Look at me."
"Yeah, I am. Wait till Fritz sees you."
"If he ever does," Wolfe said grimly. "We have a chance, and that's all. If
all we needed were evidence of Zeck's complicity in felonies, there would be no problem; I know where it is and I could get it. But his defenses are everywhere, making him next to invulnerable. It would be fatuous to suppose that he could ever be convicted, and even if he were, he would still be living, so that wouldn't help any. Now that I am committed against him, and he knows it, there are only two possible outcomes - "

"Not on his payroll. I have been placed in charge of the operation here of the device which I conceived and used in Los Angeles. My handling of it has so impressed him that I am being trusted with other responsibilities."
"And Max Christy and that driver downstairs - they're Zeck men?" "Yes - at a distance."
"Then how come salting Barry Rackham? Wasn't it Zeck money that

 Rackham was getting?"
==> Wolfe sighed. "Archie, if we had more time I would let you go on and on. <==
I could shut my eyes and pretend I'm back home." He shook his head vigorously. "But we must get down to business. I said that driver is a Zeck man at a distance, but that is mere surmise. Being new and by no means firmly established in confidence, I am certainly being watched, and that driver might even report to Zeck himself. That was why I prolonged our talk in the car before suggesting that we come here. We shouldn't be more than an hour, so you'd better let me - "
He stopped as I grasped the knob and pulled the door open. I had tiptoed across to it as he talked. Seeing an empty hall in both directions, I dosed the door and went back to my chair.
"I was only asking," I protested, "why the play on Rackham?"
"How long," Wolfe asked, "have you and I spent, there in the office, discussing some simple affair such as the forging of a check?"
"Oh, anywhere from four minutes to four hours."

"Ditch him and we'll meet somewhere."
"Impossible. No place would be safe - except one. There is only one circumstance under which any man is granted the right to an extended period of undisturbed privacy, either by deliberation or on impulse. We need a woman. You know all kinds."
"Not all kinds," I objected, "I do draw the line. What kind do we need?"
"Fairly young, attractive, a little wanton in appearance, utterly devoted to you and utterly trustworthy, and not a fool."
"My God, if I knew where to find one like that I'd have been married long ago. Also I would be bragging - "
==> "Archie," he snapped. "If after all your promiscuous philandering you can't produce a woman to those specifications, I've misjudged you. It's risky to trust anyone at all, but any other way would be still riskier." <==
I had my lips puckered. "Ruth Brady?"
"No. She's an operative, and known. Out of the question."
"There's one who might take this as a substitute for a trip to Norway,
which is now out. I could ask her." "What's her name?"
"You know. Lily Rowan."

He made a face. "She is rich, intemperate, and notorious."
"Nuts. She is well-heeled and playful. You remember the time she helped
out with an upstate murderer. I have no further suggestions. Do I phone her?" "Yes."
"And tell her what?"
He explained in some detail. When he had answered my three or four questions, and filed my objection by asking if I had something better to offer, I pulled the phone to me and dialed a number. No answer. I tried the Troubadour Room of the Churchill; she wasn't there. Next in order of priority was the Flamingo Club. That found her. Asked my name, I said to tell her it was Escamillo, though she hadn't called me that for quite a while.
==> After a wait her voice came. "Archie? Really?" <==
"I prefer Escamillo," I said firmly. "It's a question of security. How high are you?"
"Come and find out, I'm tired of the people I'm with, anyhow. Listen, I'll wander out and meet you in front and we'll go - "
"We will not. I'm working, and I'm on a spot, and I need help. You're just the type for it, and I pay a dollar an hour if you give satisfaction. I'm offering you a brand new thrill. You have never earned a nickel in your life, and here's your chance. What mood are you in?"
"I'm bored as the devil, but all I need is six dances with you and - " "Not tonight, my colleen donn. Damn it, I'm working. Will you help?" "When?"
"NOW."

"I'll make it a dollar ten an hour. The man will call you Lily, and you will call him Pete. Joining him in the car and riding up to your place, you need not go to extremes, but it is important for the driver to get the idea that you are mighty glad to see Pete and that you are looking forward with pleasure to the next several hours with him. But - "
"Is it a reunion after a long absence?"
"I'll make it a dollar twenty an hour. I was about to say, you can leave it vague whether you last saw Pete a week ago or two months ago. You're just glad to be with him because you're so fond of him, but don't get thinking you're Paulette Goddard and ham it. Do it right. Pretend it's me. Which brings me to the crux. It's going to be an ordeal for you. Wait till you see Pete."
"What's the matter with him?"
"Everything. He's old enough to be your father and then some. He has whiskers, turning gray. His face is pleated. You will have to fight down the feeling that you're having a nightmare, and - "
==> "Archie! It's Nero Wolfe!" <==
Goddam a woman anyhow. There was absolutely no sense or reason for it. My brain buzzed.
"Sure," I said admiringly. "You do it with mirrors. If it was him, the way I feel about him, the first thing I would do would be to get him a date with you, huh? Okay, then don't call him Pete, call him Nero."
"Then who is it?"
"It's a man named Pete Roeder, and I've got to have a long talk with him that won't get in the papers."
"We could take him to Norway."

XIV
SINCE I do not intend to use up paper reporting the five-hour conference I had with Wolfe that night in Lily Rowan's living room, I could just as well go on to Wednesday morning, except for one thing. I have got to tell about their arrival
at the door of Lily's penthouse apartment on East 63rd Street.
Wolfe didn't speak and wouldn't look at me. Lily shook hands with me, a
form of greeting we hadn't used for I don't know how long, then unlocked the door, and we entered. When her wrap and Wolfe's hat had been disposed of and we passed to the living room, she tossed her firecracker.
==> "Archie," she said, "I knew darned well that something would happen some day to make up for all the time I've wasted on you, I just felt it would." <==
I nodded. "Certainly. You'll show a profit on the night even if you feed us sandwiches, especially since Pete is a light eater. He's on a diet."
"Oh," she said, "I didn't mean money, and you can go the limit on sandwiches. I meant the distinction you've brought me. I'm the only woman in America who has necked with Nero Wolfe. Nightmare, my eye. He has a flair."
Wolfe, who had seated himself, cocked his head to frown at her - a first- rate performance.
I smiled at her. "I told Pete what you said on the phone, and he was flattered. Okay, woman of distinction."
She shook her head. "Turn loose, my brave fellow. I've got hold of it."

I nodded. "Certainly. You'll show a profit on the night even if you feed us sandwiches, especially since Pete is a light eater. He's on a diet."
"Oh," she said, "I didn't mean money, and you can go the limit on sandwiches. I meant the distinction you've brought me. I'm the only woman in America who has necked with Nero Wolfe. Nightmare, my eye. He has a flair."
Wolfe, who had seated himself, cocked his head to frown at her - a first- rate performance.
I smiled at her. "I told Pete what you said on the phone, and he was flattered. Okay, woman of distinction."
She shook her head. "Turn loose, my brave fellow. I've got hold of it."
==> She moved to Wolfe, looking down at him. "Don't be upset, Pete. I wouldn't have known you from Adam, no one would; that wasn't it. It's my hero here. Archie's an awful prude. He has been up against some tough ones, lots of them, and not once has he ever called on me to help. Never! A proud prude. Suddenly he calls me away from revelry - I might have been reveling for all he knew - to get into a car and be intimate with a stranger. There's only one person on earth he would do that for: you. So if I was pretty ardent in the car, I knew what I was doing. And don't worry about me - whatever you're up to, my lips are sealed. Anyway, to me you will always be Pete. The only woman in America <==

 who has necked with Nero Wolfe - my God, I'll treasure it forever. Now I'll go make some sandwiches. What kind of a diet are you on?"
Wolfe said through his teeth, "I care for nothing." "That can't be. A peach? Grapes? A leaf of lettuce?" "No!"
"A glass of water?"
"Yes!"

 "Then we could be serious about it."
"Do you mean," Saul Panzer asked, "that the purpose is to get on his
nerves?"
"No. Play it straight. I only mean it's not life and death - until further
==> notice." I pushed my chair back and got up. "And now I wish to prove that being an employer hasn't changed me any. You may continue to call me Archie. You may come with me to Thirty-fifth Street, where we will find a poker deck, and Fritz will make five, and when we have finished I'll lend you carfare home." <==
For the record, I lost twelve dollars. Saul was the big winner. One hand, I had three nines and - but I'd better get on. Rackham was living at the Churchill, in an air-conditioned suite in the tower. During the first week we compiled quite a biography of him. He never stuck his nose outside before one o'clock, and once not until four. His ports of call included two banks, a law office, nine bars, two clubs, a barber shop, seven other shops and stores, three restaurants, three theaters, two night spots, and miscellaneous. He usually ate lunch with a man or men, and dinner with a woman. Not the same woman; three different ones during the week. As described by my operatives, they were a credit to their sex, to the American way of life, and to the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union.
I took on a little of it myself, but mostly I left it to the help. Not that I loafed. There were quite a few hours with Lily Rowan, off and on, both as a substitute for the trip to Norway, indefinitely postponed, and as a check on the soundness of the estimate of her I had given Wolfe. She caused me no qualms. Once when we were dancing she sighed for Pete, and once at her apartment she said she would love to help some more with my work, but when I tactfully made it plain that the detective business was not on our agenda she took it nicely and let it lay.
There were other things, including the reports on Rackham to be typed. Late every afternoon Max Christy called at my office to get the report of the day before, and he would sit and read it and ask questions. When he got critical, I would explain patiently that I couldn't very well post a man at the door of Rackham's suite to take pictures of all the comers and goers, and that we were scoring better than eighty per cent on all his hours outside, which was exceptional for New York tailing.
I had the advantage, of course, of having had the situation described to me by their Pete Roeder. They were worried a little about Westchester, but more about the city. Shortly after he had become a millionaire by way of a steak knife, whoever had used it, Rackham had got word to Zeck that he was no longer available for contacts. Brownie Costigan had got to Rackham, thinking to put the

When I was through he muttered, "Satisfactory. Confound this smell." "It'll go away in time. Sixty dollars an ounce."
"Speaking of dollars, you didn't deposit what you took from Rackham?" "No. It's in the safe."
"Leave it there for the present. It's Mrs. Rackham's money, and we may decide we've earned it. Heaven knows no imaginable sum could repay me for these months. I was thinking - "
He cut it off, tilted his head a little, and regarded me with eyes narrowed to slits.
"Well?" I said aggressively. "More bright ideas?"
==> "I was thinking, Archie. August is gone. The risk would be negligible. Get <==

 Mr. Haskins on the phone tomorrow and tell him to start a dozen chicks on blueberries. Uh - two dozen. You can tell him they are for gifts to your friends."
"No, sir."
"Yes. Tomorrow."
"I say no. He would know damn well who they were for. My God, is your

"Yes. Tomorrow."
"I say no. He would know damn well who they were for. My God, is your
stomach more important than your neck? Not to mention mine. You can't help it if you were born greedy, but you can try to control - "
==> "Archie." His voice was thin and cold with fury. "Nearly five months now. Look at me." <==
"Yes, sir." He had me. "You're right. I beg your pardon. But I am not going to phone Haskins. You just had a moment of weakness. Let's change the subject. Does Rackham's biting on the first try change the schedule any?"
"You could tell Mr. Haskins - "
"No."
He gave up. After sitting a while with his eyes closed, he sighed so deep it
made him shudder, and then came back to black reality. Only a quarter of his hour was left, and we used it to review the situation and program. The strategy was unchanged. At midnight he arose.

 for an argument, so I simply stood at attention. It was a fast and expert job, with no waste motion and no intent to offend.
"It's all a matter of practice," I said courteously.
"Yeah," the taller one agreed, in a tenor that was almost a falsetto. "Follow me.
He moved to the wall, with me behind. The cars had been stopped short of the wall to leave an alley, and we went down it a few paces to a door where a man was standing. He opened the door for us - it was the one that made little noise - and we passed through into a small vestibule, also with no windows in its concrete walls. Across it, only three paces, steps down began, and we descended - fourteen shallow steps to a wide metal door. My conductor pushed a button in the metal jamb. I heard no sound within, but in a moment the door opened and a pasty-faced bird with a pointed chin was looking at us.
==> "Archie Goodwin," my conductor said. <==
"Step in."
I waited politely to be preceded, but my conductor moved aside, and the
other one said impatiently, "Step in, Goodwin."
I crossed the sill, and the sentinel closed the door. I was in a room bigger
than the vestibule above: bare concrete walls, well-lighted, with a table, three chairs, a water-cooler, and a rack of magazines and newspapers. A second sentinel, seated at the table, writing in a book like a ledger, sent me a sharp glance and then forgot me. The first one crossed to another big metal door directly opposite to the one I had entered by, and when he pulled it open I saw that it was a good five inches thick. He jerked his head and told me, "On in."

other one said impatiently, "Step in, Goodwin."
I crossed the sill, and the sentinel closed the door. I was in a room bigger

The first one crossed to another big metal door directly opposite to the one I had entered by, and when he pulled it open I saw that it was a good five inches thick. He jerked his head and told me, "On in."
I stepped across and passed through, with him at my heels.
This was quite a chamber. The walls were paneled in a light gray wood with pink in it, from the tiled floor to the ceiling, and the mgs were the same light gray with pink borders. Light came from a concealed trough continuous around the ceiling. The six or seven chairs and the couch were covered in pinkish gray leather, and the same leather had been used for the frames of the pictures, a couple of big ones on each wall. All that, collected in my first swift survey, made a real impression.
==> "Archie Goodwin," the sentinel said. <==
The man at the desk said, "Sit down, Goodwin. All right, Schwartz," and the sentinel left us and closed the door.
I would have been surprised to find that Pete Roeder rated all this splash so soon after hitting this territory, and he didn't. The man at the desk was not Roeder. I had never seen this bozo, but no introduction was needed.
Much as he disliked publicity, his picture had been in the paper a few

 times, as for instance the occasion of his presenting his yacht to the United States Coast Guard during the war. Also I had heard him described. I had a good view of him at ten feet when I sat in one of the pinkish gray leather chairs near his desk. Actually there was nothing to him but his forehead and eyes. It wasn't a forehead, it was a dome, sloping up and up to the line of his faded thin hair. The eyes were the result of an error on the assembly line. They had been intended for a shark and someone got careless.

"He was a little handicapped," I protested, "by his respect for law."
"Every man is handicapped by his own weaknesses. If you communicate with him give him my regards. I have great admiration for him."
Zeck glanced at a clock on the wall and then at Roeder. "I'm keeping a caller waiting. Goodwin is under your direction, but he is on trial. Consult me as necessary within the routine."
He must have had floor buttons for foot-signaling, for he touched nothing with his hands, but the door opened and the sentinel appeared.
Zeck said, "Put Goodwin on the B list, Schwartz."
==> Roeder and I arose and headed for the door, him with his brief case under his arm. Remembering how he had told me, tapping his chest, "I am a D, Archie," I would have given a lot if I could have tapped my own bosom and announced, "I am a B, Mr. Wolfe." <==

XVII
THERE was one chore Wolfe had given me which I haven't mentioned, because I didn't care to reveal the details - and still don't. But the time will come when you will want to know where the gun at the bottom of the brief case came from, so I may as well say now that you aren't going to know.
Since filing the number from a gun has been made obsolete by the progress of science, the process of getting one that can't be traced has got more complicated and requires a little specialized knowledge. One has to be acquainted with the right people. I am. But there is no reason why you should be, so I won't give their names and addresses. I couldn't quite meet Wolfe's specifications - the size and weight of a .22 and the punch of a .45 - but I did pretty well; a Carson Snub Thirty, an ugly little devil, but straight and powerful.
I tried it out one evening in the basement at 35th Street. When I was through I collected the bullets and dumped them in the river. We were taking enough chances without adding another, however slim.

"As I understand it," he said, "we're going to give Rackham a cut, and before I tell him about it I wish you'd take a look at this revised list of percentages. Yours is of course fixed, and I don't like to reduce mine unless it's absolutely unavoidable ..."
He had a sheet of paper in his hand. With his brief case on his lap, and loose papers, it was awkward for him to get up, so I obliged. I reached, and he handed me the paper, and I had to leave my chair to get it to Zeck. On my way I took a glance at the paper because I thought it was in character to do that, and if I ever needed my character to stay put for another four seconds I did right then. When I extended my hand to Zeck I released the paper an instant too soon and it started to drop. I grabbed at it and missed, and that made me take another step and bend over, which put me in exactly the right position to take him away from there before he could possibly get a toe on one of the buttons under his desk.
Not wanting to knock his chair over, I used my left knee to push him back, chair and all, my right knee to land on his thighs and keep him there, and my hands for his throat. There was only one thing in my mind at that precise instant, the instant I had him away from the desk, and that was the fear that I would break his neck. Since I was in front of him I had to make absolutely sure, not only that he didn't yap, but also that he was too uncomfortable to try things like jabbing his thumbs in my eyes, but God knows I didn't want to overdo it, and bones and tendons are by no means all alike.
What will be merely an inconvenience for one man will finish another one for good. His mouth was open wide and his shark eyes were popping. With my knee on him he couldn't kick, and his arms were just flopping around. And Roeder was there by me, with a wadded handkerchief in one hand and a piece of cord in the other. As soon as he had the handkerchief stuffed tight in the open mouth he moved to the rear of the chair, taking Zeck's right hand with him, and reached around for the left hand. It tried to elude him, and I increased the pressure of my fingers a little, and then he got it.
"Hurry up," I growled, "or I'll kill him sure as hell."
==> It took him a year. It took him forever. But finally he straightened up, came around to take another look at the handkerchief and poke it in a little tighter, backed up, and muttered, "All right, Archie." <==
When I took my hands away my fingers ached like the devil, but that was nerves, not muscles. I leaned over to get my ear an inch away from his nose; there was no question about his breathing.


"His pulse is all right," Roeder said, not through his nose.
"You're crazy," Rackham said hoarsely. "Good God! You're crazy!" He was out of his chair, standing there in front of it, trembling all over.

Zeck nodded.
"It will have to be more or less on my terms. I can be trusted; you cannot. You will have to deliver first. But I realize that the details of anything as vital as this is to you cannot be settled without discussion, and it must be discussed and settled now. We are going to release your hands and take that handkerchief from your mouth, but before we do so, one more warning. You are to stay where you are until we're finished. If you move toward the floor signals under your desk, or try to summon your men in any other manner, you will die before anyone else does. Also, of course, there is the evidence that exists against you. You understand the situation?"
Zeck nodded.
"Are you ready to discuss the matter?"
Zeck nodded.
==> "Release him, Archie," Wolfe snapped. <==
Needing two hands to untie the cord, I put the Carson Snub Thirty down
on the polished top of Zeck's desk. I would have given a year's pay for a glance at Rackham, to see what the chances were, but that might have ruined it. So I put the gun there, stepped around to the rear of Zeck's chair, knelt, and started untying the knot. My heart was pounding my ribs like a sledgehammer.
So I didn't see it happen; I could only hear it. I did see one thing there behind Zeck's chair: a sudden convulsive jerk of his arms, which must have been

 his reaction to the sight of Rackham jumping for the gun I had left on the desk. More even than a sight of Rackham, to see if he was rising to it, I wanted a sight of Wolfe, to see if he was keeping his promise to duck for cover the instant Rackham started for the gun, but I couldn't afford it.

All but Archer's. "You have signed a statement," he told Wolfe, "to the effect that Zeck told Rackham he could produce evidence that would convict him of murder, and that Rackham thereupon shot Zeck. Now you say, in contradiction - "
"There is no contradiction," Wolfe declared. "The fact of Rackham's innocence would have been no defense against evidence manufactured by Zeck, and Rackham knew it. Innocent as he was - of this murder, that is - he knew what Zeck was capable of."
"You have said that you think Rackham killed his wife, but that you have no proof."
"I have not," Wolfe snapped. "Read your transcripts."
"I shall. And you now say that you think Rackham did not kill his wife?" "Not that I think he didn't. I know he didn't, because I know who did." Wolfe flipped a hand. "I've known that from the beginning. That night in
==> April, when Mr. Goodwin phoned me that Mrs. Rackham had been murdered, I knew who had murdered her. But I also knew that the interests of Arnold Zeck were involved and I dared not move openly. So I - but you know all about that." Wolfe turned to me. "Archie. Precautions may not be required, but you might as well take them." <==


I opened a desk drawer and got out the Grisson .38. My favorite Colt,
taken from me in Zeck's garage antechamber, was gone forever. After a glance at the cylinder I dropped the Grisson in my side pocket and as I did so lifted my head to the audience. As if they had all been on one circuit, the six pairs of eyes left me and went to Wolfe.
"I don't like this," Archer said in a tight voice. "I am here officially, and I don't like it. I want to speak to you privately."

"You used that dog," Wolfe went on, his voice as icy as Arnold Zeck's had ever been, "even after it died. You were remorseless to your dead friend. To impress Mr. Goodwin, you were overcome with emotion at the thought that, though you had given the dog to your cousin two years ago, it had come to your doorstep to die. It had not come to your doorstep to die, Mr. Leeds, and you knew it; it had come there to try to get at you. It wanted to sink its teeth in you just once. I say you knew it, because when you squatted beside the dog and put your hand on it, it snarled. It would not have snarled if it had felt your hand as the soothing and sympathetic touch of a trusted friend in its last agony; indeed not; it snarled because it knew you, at the end, to be unworthy of its love and trust, and it scorned and hated you. That snarl alone is enough to convict you. Do you remember that snarl, Mr. Leeds? Will you ever forget it? Your old friend Nobby, his last words for you - "
Leeds' head went forward, dropping, and his hands came up to cover his face. He made no sound, and no one else did either. The silence darted around us and into us, coming out from Leeds. Then Lina Darrow took in a breath with a sighing, sobbing sound, and Annabel got up and went to her.
"Take him, Mr. Archer," Wolfe said grimly. "I'm through with him, and it's about time."

I'M SITTING at a window overlooking a fiord, typing this on a new portable I bought for the trip. In here it's pleasant. It's late in the season for outdoors in Norway, but if you run hard to keep your blood going you can stand it. I got a letter yesterday which read as follows:
==> Dear Archie: <==
The chickens came from Mr. Haskins Friday, four of them, and they were satisfactory. Marko came to dinner. He misses Fritz, he says. I have given Fritz a raise.
Mr. Cramer dropped in for a talk one day last week. He made

 some rather pointed comments about you, but on the whole behaved himself tolerably.
I am writing this longhand because I do not like the way the man sent by the agency types.

Fed up with an empty house and the phone ringing and being called a bar, I put in a call myself from a drugstore booth, and made personal arrangements for dinner and a show.
Wednesday morning a visitor came that I let in. I had formed the habit,

 since returning from jail, of hearing the doorbell ring, going to the hall, observing through the one-way glass panel who it was out on the stoop, making a face, and returning to the office. If the bell kept ringing long enough to be a nuisance I flipped the switch that turned it off. This time, around eleven Wednesday morning, instead of making a face I went and opened the door and said, "Well, hello! Coming in?"
A chunky specimen about my height, with wrinkled pink skin and gray hair and sharp gray-blue eyes, grunted a greeting and stepped over the sill.
==> I said it was cold for April, and he agreed. As I hung his topcoat on the rack I told myself that I must be more restrained. The fact that I was alone in the house was no reason to give Inspector Cramer of Manhattan Homicide the impression that I was glad to see him. Wolfe or no Wolfe, I could keep up appearances. <==
I let him lead the way to the office. This time I sat at my own desk. I was tempted to take Wolfe's chair again just to see how he would react, but it would have put me at a disadvantage, I was so used to dealing with him, in the red leather chair, from my own angle.
He eyed me. "So you're holding the fort," he growled.
"Not exactly," I objected. "I'm only the caretaker. Or maybe I'm going down with the ship. Not that those who have left are rats."
"Where's Wolfe?"
"I don't know. Next, you call me a liar. Then I say I have been, but not now. Then you - "

He took a cigar from his pocket, inspected it, rubbed it between his palms, and inspected it again. "It must be quite a thing," he remarked, not growling. "That ad in the paper. The plants gone. Fritz and Theodore gone. Vukcic listing the house for sale. I'm going to miss it, I am, never dropping in to see him sitting there thinking he's smarter than God and all His angels. Quite a thing, it must be. What is it?"
I said slowly and wearily, "Either I don't know what it is, or I do know but

 -"
"What about the sausage that turned into tear gas? Any connection?"
==> I am always ready for Inspector Cramer, in the light of experience guided by intelligence, and therefore didn't bat an eye. I merely cocked my head a little, met his gaze, and considered the matter until I was satisfied. "I doubt if it was Fritz," I stated. "Mr. Wolfe has him too well trained. But in the excitement Sunday morning, Mr. Wolfe being gone, Fritz told Theodore, and you got it out of Theodore." I nodded. "That must be it." <==
"Did the tear gas scare him out of his skin? Or out of his house, which is the same thing. Was that it?"
"It might have, mightn't it? A coward like him?"
"No." Cramer put the cigar between his teeth, tilted up. "No, there are plenty of things about Wolfe I can and do object to, but he's not a coward. There might have been something about that tear gas that would have scared anybody. Was there?"
"As far as I know, it was just plain tear gas, nothing fancy." I decided to shove a little. "You know, it's nice to have you here any time, just for company, but aren't you spreading out some? Your job is homicide, and the tear gas didn't even make us sick, let alone kill us. Also your job is in the County of New York, and Mrs. Rackham died in Westchester. I enjoy talking with you, but have you got credentials?"
He made a noise that could have been a chuckle. "That's more like it," he said, not sarcastically. "You're beginning to sound natural. I'll tell you. I'm here at the request of Ben Dykes, who would give all his teeth and one ear to clear up the Rackham case ahead of the state boys. He thinks that Archer, the DA, may have swallowed the idea that you and Leeds are lying too deep, and he came to me as an expert on Nero Wolfe, which God knows I am. He laid it all out for me and wanted my opinion."

He laid it all out for me and wanted my opinion."
He shifted the cigar to a new angle. "The way it looked to me, there were three possibilities. First, the one that Archer has sold himself on, that you and Leeds are lying, and that what Mrs. Rackham really told Wolfe when she came here, together with her getting murdered the next day, somehow put Wolfe on a spot that was too hot for him, and he scooted, after fixing with you to cover as well as you could. I told Dykes I would rule that out, for various reasons - chiefly because neither you nor Wolfe would risk that much on a setup that depended on a stranger like Leeds sticking to a lie. Shall I analyze it more?"
"No, thanks, that'll do."
"I thought so. Next, the possibility that when you phoned Wolfe right after the body was found you told him something that gave him a line on the

First, the one that Archer has sold himself on, that you and Leeds are lying, and that what Mrs. Rackham really told Wolfe when she came here, together with her getting murdered the next day, somehow put Wolfe on a spot that was too hot for him, and he scooted, after fixing with you to cover as well as you could. I told Dykes I would rule that out, for various reasons - chiefly because neither you nor Wolfe would risk that much on a setup that depended on a stranger like Leeds sticking to a lie. Shall I analyze it more?"
"No, thanks, that'll do."
"I thought so. Next, the possibility that when you phoned Wolfe right after the body was found you told him something that gave him a line on the

 murderer, but it's tricky and he had to go outdoors to get his evidence, preparing to grandstand it for the front page. I told Dykes I would rule that out too. Wolfe is quite capable of a play like that, sure he is, but if that's all it amounted to, why move the plants out and put Frits to work in a restaurant and list the house for sale? He's colorful, but not that colorful. Mrs. Rackham only paid him ten thousand, about what I make a year. Why should he spend it having his orchids carted around?"
==> Cramer shook his head, "Not for my money. That leaves the third possibility: that something really did scare him. That there was something about Mrs. Rackham's murder, or anyhow connected with it, that he knew he couldn't handle sitting there in that chair, but for some reason he had to handle it. So he scooted. As you say, you either don't know where he is or you know and won't tell - and that's no help either way. Now I've got a lot to say about this possibility. You got time to listen?" <==
"I've got all day, but Fritz isn't here to get our lunch."
"We'll go without." He clasped his hands behind his head and shifted his center of gravity. "You know, Archie, sometimes I'm not as far behind as you think I am."
"Also sometimes I don't think you're as far behind as you think I do."
"That's possible. Anyhow, I can add. I think he got word direct from Arnold Zeck. Did he?"
"Huh? Who's Arnold Zeck? Did you just make it up?"

"We'll go without." He clasped his hands behind his head and shifted his center of gravity. "You know, Archie, sometimes I'm not as far behind as you think I am."
"Also sometimes I don't think you're as far behind as you think I do."
"That's possible. Anyhow, I can add. I think he got word direct from Arnold Zeck. Did he?"
"Huh? Who's Arnold Zeck? Did you just make it up?"
I knew that was a mistake the instant it was out of my mouth. Then I had to try to keep it from showing on my face, the realization that I had fumbled it, but whether that was a success or not - and I couldn't very well look in a mirror to find out - it was too late.
==> Cramer looked pleased. "So you've been around all these years, a working detective, meeting the people you do, and you've never heard of Arnold Zeck. Either I've got to believe that, or I touched a tender spot." <==
"Sure I've heard of him. It just didn't click for a second."
"Oh, for God's sake. It's affecting you already, having Wolfe gone. That wasn't just a shot in the dark. One day two years ago I sat here in this chair. Wolfe sat there." He nodded at Wolfe's chair. "You were where you are now. A man named Orchard had been murdered, and so had a woman named Poole. In the course of our long talk Wolfe explained in detail how an ingenious and ruthless man could operate a blackmail scheme, good for at least a million a year, without sticking his neck out. Not only could; it was being done. Wolfe refused to name him, and since he wasn't behind the murders it was out of my territory, but a thing or two I heard and a couple of things that happened gave me

 a pretty clear idea. Not only me - it was whispered around: Arnold Zeck. You may perhaps remember it."
"I remember the Orchard case, certainly," I conceded. "I didn't hear the whispering."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 35055    window = 35050 35060


"I remember the Orchard case, certainly," I conceded. "I didn't hear the whispering."
"I did. You may also remember that a year later, last summer, Wolfe's plant rooms got shot up from a roof across the street."
"Yep. I was sitting right here and heard it."
"So I understand. Since no one was killed that never got to me officially, but naturally I heard things. Wolfe had started to investigate a man named Rony, and Rony's activities were the kind that might lead a first-class investigator like Wolfe in the direction of Arnold Zeck, maybe up close to Zeck, possibly even clear to him. I thought then that Wolfe had got warned off, by Zeck himself or someone near him, and he had disregarded it, and for a second warning they messed up his orchids. Then Rony got killed, and that was a break for Wolfe because it put him and Zeck on the same side."
"Gosh," I remarked, "it sounds awful complicated to me."
==> "I'll bet it does." Cramer moved the cigar - getting shorter now, although he never lit one - to the other side of his mouth. "All I'm doing is showing you that I'm not just hoping for a bite, and I don't want to string it out. It was a good guess that Wolfe had jostled up against Arnold Zeck in both the Orchard case and the Rony case, and now what happens? Not long after Mrs. Rackham calls on him and hires him to check on her husband's income, someone sends him a cylinder of tear gas - not a bomb to blow out his guts, which it could have been, just tear gas, so of course it was for a warning. And that night Mrs. Rackham gets murdered. You tell him about it on the phone, and when you get home he's gone." <==
Cramer took the cigar from his mouth and pointed it at me. "I'll tell you what I believe, Archie. I believe that if Wolfe had stayed and helped, the murderer of Mrs. Rackham would be locked up by now. I believe that he had reason to think that if he did that, helped to catch the murderer, he would have to spend the rest of his life trying to keep Arnold Zeck from getting him. I believe that he decided that the only way out was for him to get Zeck. How's that?"
"No comment," I said politely. "If you're right you're right, and if you're wrong I wouldn't want to hurt your feelings."
"Much obliged. But he did get a warning from Zeck - the tear gas." "No comment."
"I wouldn't expect any. Now here's what I came for. I want you to give
Wolfe a personal message from me, not as a police officer but as a friend. This is between you and me - and him. Zeck is out of his reach. He is out of anybody's

I'm not pointing at Ben Dykes or the DA up there, I'm not pointing at any person or persons, but if the setup is that Barry Rackham is tied in with one or more of Zeck's operations, and if Rackham killed his wife, I say he will never burn, I don't say at what point Zeck will get his hand in, or who or what he will use, but Rackham will never burn."
==> Cramer hurled his cigar at my wastebasket and missed it a foot. Since it wasn't lit I ignored it. "Hooray for justice," I cheered. <==
He snarled, but apparently not at me. "I want you to tell Wolfe that. Zeck is out of his reach. He can't get him."
"But," I objected, "granting that you've got it all straight, which I haven't, that's a hell of a message. Look at it from the other end. He is not out of Zeck's reach, not if he comes home. I know he doesn't go out much, but even if he never did people have to come in - and things, like packages of sausage. Not to mention that the damage they did to the plants and equipment last year came to thirty-eight thousand bucks. I get the idea that he is to lay off of Zeck, but that's only what he doesn't do. What does he do?"
Cramer nodded. "I know. That's it. He's so damn bullheaded. I want you to understand, Archie, why I came here. Wolfe is too cocky to live. He has enough brass and bluster to outfit a thousand sergeants. Sure, I know him; I ought to. I would love to bloody his nose for him, I've tried to often enough, and some day I will and enjoy it. But I would hate to see him break his neck on a deal like this where he hasn't got a chance. It's a good guess that in the past ten years there have been over a hundred homicides in this town that were connected in one way or another with one of the operations Arnold Zeck has a hand in. But not in a single case was there the remotest hope of tying Zeck up with it. We couldn't possibly have touched him."
"You're back where you started," I complained. "He can't be reached. So what?"
"So Wolfe should come back where he belongs, return what Mrs. Rackham paid him to her estate, let the Westchester people take care of the murder, which is their job anyhow, and go on as before. You can tell him I said that, but by God don't quote me around. I'm not responsible for a man like Zeck being out of reach."

 he is to me as Zeck is to him. He's out of my reach. I don't know where he is."
"Oh, keep it up."
"I will. Second, I don't like the message. I admit that I have known Mr. Wolfe to discuss Arnold Zeck. I once heard him tell a whole family about him, only he was calling him X. He was describing the difficulties he would be in if he ever found himself tangled with X for a showdown, and he told them that he was acquainted, more or less, with some three thousand people living or working in New York, and there weren't more than five of them of whom he could say with certainty that they were in no way involved in X's activities. He said that none might be or that any might be. On another occasion I happened to be inquiring about Zeck of a newspaperman, and he had extravagant notions about Zeck's payroll. He mentioned, not by name, politicians, barBies, cops, chambermaids, lawyers, private ops, crooks of all types, including gunmen - maybe housewives, I forget. He did not specifically mention police inspectors."
"Just forgot, perhaps."
"I suppose so. Another thing, those five exceptions that Mr. Wolfe made out of his three thousand acquaintances, he didn't say who they were, but I was pretty sure I could name three of them. I thought probably one of the other two was you, but I could have been wrong. You have made a point of how you would hate to see him break his neck where he hasn't got a chance. You took the trouble to come here with a personal message but don't want to be quoted, which means that if I mention this conversation to anyone but Mr. Wolfe you'll call me a liar. And what's the message? That he should lay off of Zeck, that's what it amounts to. If in earning the fee Mrs. Rackham paid him he is liable to hurt somebody Zeck doesn't want hurt, he should return the fee. The way it looks from here, sending a message like that to the best and toughest detective on earth is exactly the kind of service Zeck would pay good money for. I wouldn't say - "
==> I didn't get to say what I wouldn't say. Cramer, out of his chair and coming, had a look on his face that I had never seen before. Time and again I had seen him mad at Wolfe, and me too, but never to the point where the pink left his cheeks completely and his eyes looked absolutely mean. <==
He swung with his right. I ducked. He came up from beneath with his left, and I stopped it with my forearm. He tried with the right again, and I jerked back, stepped aside, and dived around the corner of Wolfe's desk.
I spoke. "You couldn't hit me in a year and I'm not going to plug you. I'm twenty years younger, and you're an inspector. If I'm wrong, some day I'll apologize. If I'm wrong."
He turned and marched out. I didn't go to the hall to help him on with his coat and open the door.

X
At first, that first night, I was thinking that word might come from Wolfe in the next hour. Then I started thinking it might come the next day. As the days kept creeping along they changed my whole attitude, and before the end of April I was thinking it might come next week. By the time May had passed, and most of June, and the calendar and the heat both said summer, I was beginning to think it might never come.
But first to finish with April. The Rackham case followed the routine of spectacular murders when they never quite get to the point of a first-degree charge against anyone. For a week, the front page by unanimous consent; then, for a week or ten days, the front page only by cooking up an angle; and then back to the minors. None of the papers happened to feel like using it to start a crusade in the name of justice, so it took a normal course. It did not roll over and die, not with that all-star cast, including Nobby and Hebe; even months later a really new development would have got a three-column spread; but the development didn't come.
==> I made three more trips, by official request, to White Plains, with no profit to anyone, including me. All I could do was repeat myself, and all they could do was think up new ways to ask the same questions. For mental exercise I tried to get a line on whether Cramer's notions about Arnold Zeck had been passed on to Archer and Ben Dykes, but if so they never let on. <==
All I knew was what I read in the papers, until one evening I ran into Sergeant Purley Stebbins at Jake's and bought him a lobster. From him I got two little unpublished items: two FBI men had been called in to settle an argument about the legibility of fingerprints on the crinkly silver handle of the knife, and had voted no; and at one point Barry Rackham had been held at White Plains for twenty straight hours while the battle raged over whether they had enough to charge him. The noes won that time too.
The passing days got very little help from me. I had decided not to start pawing the ground or rearing up until Wolfe had been gone a full month, which would be May ninth, and I caught up on a lot of personal things, including baseball games, which don't need to be itemized. Also, with Fred Durkin, I finished up the poison-pen case and other loose ends that Wolfe had left dangling - nothing important - drove out to Long Island to see if Theodore and the plants had got settled in their new home, and put one of the cars, the big sedan, in dead storage.
THREE weeks went by.
One afternoon when I went to Rusterman's Restaurant to see Marko

At ten o'clock I was at 1019, starting at the phone to get hold of Saul and
Orrie and Fred.
I did not like it at all. The way Wolfe was getting set to play it, it looked to
me as if we had one chance in a thousand, and while that may be good enough to go ahead on when what you're after is to nail a guy on a charge, and if you muff

==>  it the worst you get is a new start under a handicap, it's a little different when a muff means curtains. I had of course told Wolfe all I knew, including Inspector Cramer's visit and advice, but that only made him stubborner. With Zeck on Rackham's tail, through me, it seemed likely that the murderer of Mrs. Rackham might get his proper voltage with Zeck's blessing, and since that was all that Wolfe was committed to, why not settle for it? For now anyway, and then take a good breath. As for commitments, I had one of my own. I had promised myself to see Norway before I died. <==
So I didn't like it, and I either had to lump it or bow out. I tossed a coin: heads I stick, tails I quit. It landed tails, but I had to veto it because I had already talked to Orrie Gather and he was coming at noon, and I had left messages for Fred Durkin and Saul Panzer. I tossed again, tails again. I tossed once more and it was heads, which settled it. I had to stick.
The tailing of Barry Rackham was a classic, especially after the first week. It was a shame to waste the talents of Saul Panzer on what was actually a burlesque, but it was good to have him around anyhow. I briefed them all together at 1019, Wednesday evening, with Saul perched on a corner of the desk because there were only three chairs. Saul was undersized, inconspicuous all but his nose, and the best all-round man alive. Fred Durkin was big and clumsy, with a big red face, with no Doberman pinscher in him but plenty of bulldog. Orrie Gather was slender and muscular and handsome, just the man to mingle with the guests at a swell dinner party when circumstances called for it. After I had explained the job, with details as required, I supplied a little background.
"As far as you know," I told them, "I'm only doing this for practice. Your only contact is me. There is no client."
"Jesus," Fred remarked, "a hundred bucks a day and more with expenses? I guess you ought to pay in advance."
"Take it up with the NLRB," I said stiffly. "As an employer, I do not invite

"You will. That's the way they work. Whatever they offer, I'll top it. Come straight to me and I'll top it. I want to see you anyhow, every day - wait a minute. Come back and sit down. We can make a deal right now, for you to - "
"No," I said, kind but firm. "You're so damn scared it would be a temptation to bargain you out of your last pair of pants. Wait till you cool off a little and get some spunk back. Ring me any time. You understand, of course, we're still tailing you."
I left him.
Several times, walking downtown, I had to rein myself in. I would slow down to a normal gait, and in another block or so there I would be again, pounding along as fast as I could swing it, though all I had ahead was an open evening. I grinned at myself indulgently. I was excited, that was all.
The game was on, I had pitched the first ball, and it had cut the inside corner above his knees. Not only that, it was a game with no rules. It was hard to believe that Rackham could possibly go to Zeck or any of his men with it, but if he did I was on a spot hot enough to fry an egg, and Wolfe was as good as gone. That was why I had tried to talk Wolfe out of it. But now that I had started it rolling and there was no more argument, I was merely so excited that I couldn't walk slow if you paid me.
==> I had had it in mind to drop in at Rusterman's Restaurant for dinner and say hello to Marko that evening, but now I didn't feel like sitting through all the motions, so I kept going to Eleventh Avenue, to Mart's Diner, and perched on a stool while I cleaned up a plate of beef stew, three ripe tomatoes sliced by me, and two pieces of blueberry pie. Even with a full stomach I was still excited. It must have shown, I suppose in my eyes, for Mart asked me what the glow was about, and though I had never had any tendency to discuss my business with him, I had to resist an impulse to remark casually that Wolfe and I had finally mixed it up with the most dangerous baby on two legs, one so tough that even Inspector Cramer had said he was out of reach. <==
I went home and sat in the office all evening, holding magazines open as if I were reading them. All I really did was listen for the phone or doorbell. When the phone rang at ten o'clock and it was only Fred Durkin wanting to know where Saul and the subject were, I was so rude that I hurt his feelings and had to apologize. I told him to cover the Churchill as usual, which was one of the factors that made it a burlesque, since that would have required four men at least. What I wanted to do so bad I could taste if was call the number Wolfe had given

 me, but that had been for emergency only. I looked emergency up in the dictionary, and got "an unforeseen combination of circumstances which calls for immediate action." Since this was just the opposite, a foreseen combination of circumstances which called for getting a good night's sleep, I didn't dial the number. I did get the good night's sleep.
Saturday morning at 1019 I had to pitch another ball, but not to the same batter. The typing of Friday's reports required only the customary summarizing of facts as far as Saul and Fred and Orrie were concerned, but my own share took time and thought. I had to account for the full time I had spent in Rackham's suite, since there was a double risk in it: the chance that I was being checked and had been seen entering and leaving, and the chance that Rackham had himself split a seam. So it was quite a literary effort and I spent three hours on it. That afternoon, when Max Christy called to get the report as usual, and sat to look it over, I had papers on my desk which kept me so busy that I wasn't even aware if he sent me a glance when he got to the middle of the second page, where my personal contribution began. I looked up only when he finally spoke.
"So you had a talk with him, huh?"

 someone else was. I would like to have a hand in his future."
No blink. "You think you know, I suppose, the nature of my own interests and activities."
"I know what is said around. I know that a New York police inspector told me that you're out of reach."
"Name him."
==> "Cramer. Manhattan Homicide." <==
"Oh, him." Zeck made his first gesture: a forefinger straightened and
curved again. "What was the occasion?"
"He wouldn't believe me when I said I didn't know where Wolfe was. He
thought Wolfe and I were fixing to try to bring you down, and he was just telling me. I told him that maybe he would like to pull us off because he was personally interested, but that since Wolfe had scooted he was wasting it."
"That was injudicious, wasn't it?"

And not only my capacities, but the circumstances themselves, restrict me to a much more modest ambition. I can get you one of the things you want, removal of all suspicion from the innocent, but the other, having Mrs. Rackham's bequest to her husband set aside, is beyond me."
They all frowned at him, in their various fashions. Hammond, the banker, protested, "That doesn't seem to make sense. What accomplishes one accomplishes the other. If you prove that Rackham killed his wife - "


"But I can't prove that." Wolfe shook his head. "I'm sorry, but it can't be
==> done. It is true that Rackham deserved to die, and as a murderer. He killed a woman here in New York three years ago, a woman named Delia Montrose - one of Mr. Cramer's unsolved cases; Rackham ran his car over her. That was how Zeck originally got a noose on Rackham, by threatening to expose him for the murder he did commit. As you know, Mr. Archer, I penetrated some distance - not very far, but far enough - into Zeck's confidence, and I learned a good deal about his methods. I doubt if he ever had conclusive evidence that Rackham bad killed Delia Montrose, but Rackham, conscious of his guilt, hadn't the spine to demand a showdown. Murderers seldom have. Then Rackham got a spine, suddenly and fortuitously, by becoming a millionaire; he thought then he could fight it; he defied Zeck; and Zeck, taking his time, retorted by threatening to expose Rackham for the murder of his wife. The threat was dangerous and effective even without authentic evidence to support it; there could of course be no authentic evidence that Rackham killed his wife, because he didn't." <==
They all froze, still wearing the frowns. Knowing Wolfe as I did, I had suspected that was coming, so I was taking them all in to get the impact, but there wasn't much to choose. After the first shock they all began to make noises, then words came, and then, as the full beauty of it hit them, the words petered out.
All but Archer's. "You have signed a statement," he told Wolfe, "to the effect that Zeck told Rackham he could produce evidence that would convict him of murder, and that Rackham thereupon shot Zeck. Now you say, in contradiction - "
"There is no contradiction," Wolfe declared. "The fact of Rackham's innocence would have been no defense against evidence manufactured by Zeck, and Rackham knew it. Innocent as he was - of this murder, that is - he knew what Zeck was capable of."
"You have said that you think Rackham killed his wife, but that you have no proof."
"I have not," Wolfe snapped. "Read your transcripts."

"Take him, Mr. Archer," Wolfe said grimly. "I'm through with him, and it's about time."

I'M SITTING at a window overlooking a fiord, typing this on a new portable I bought for the trip. In here it's pleasant. It's late in the season for outdoors in Norway, but if you run hard to keep your blood going you can stand it. I got a letter yesterday which read as follows:
Dear Archie:
The chickens came from Mr. Haskins Friday, four of them, and they were satisfactory. Marko came to dinner. He misses Fritz, he says. I have given Fritz a raise.
==> Mr. Cramer dropped in for a talk one day last week. He made <==

 some rather pointed comments about you, but on the whole behaved himself tolerably.
I am writing this longhand because I do not like the way the man sent by the agency types.
Vanda peetersiana has a raceme 29 in. long. Its longest last year was 22 in.
We have found three snails in the warm room. I thought of mailing them to Mr. Hewkt but didn't.

At first, that first night, I was thinking that word might come from Wolfe in the next hour. Then I started thinking it might come the next day. As the days kept creeping along they changed my whole attitude, and before the end of April I was thinking it might come next week. By the time May had passed, and most of June, and the calendar and the heat both said summer, I was beginning to think it might never come.
But first to finish with April. The Rackham case followed the routine of spectacular murders when they never quite get to the point of a first-degree charge against anyone. For a week, the front page by unanimous consent; then, for a week or ten days, the front page only by cooking up an angle; and then back to the minors. None of the papers happened to feel like using it to start a crusade in the name of justice, so it took a normal course. It did not roll over and die, not with that all-star cast, including Nobby and Hebe; even months later a really new development would have got a three-column spread; but the development didn't come.
I made three more trips, by official request, to White Plains, with no profit to anyone, including me. All I could do was repeat myself, and all they could do was think up new ways to ask the same questions. For mental exercise I tried to get a line on whether Cramer's notions about Arnold Zeck had been passed on to Archer and Ben Dykes, but if so they never let on.
==> All I knew was what I read in the papers, until one evening I ran into Sergeant Purley Stebbins at Jake's and bought him a lobster. From him I got two little unpublished items: two FBI men had been called in to settle an argument about the legibility of fingerprints on the crinkly silver handle of the knife, and had voted no; and at one point Barry Rackham had been held at White Plains for twenty straight hours while the battle raged over whether they had enough to charge him. The noes won that time too. <==
The passing days got very little help from me. I had decided not to start pawing the ground or rearing up until Wolfe had been gone a full month, which would be May ninth, and I caught up on a lot of personal things, including baseball games, which don't need to be itemized. Also, with Fred Durkin, I finished up the poison-pen case and other loose ends that Wolfe had left dangling - nothing important - drove out to Long Island to see if Theodore and the plants had got settled in their new home, and put one of the cars, the big sedan, in dead storage.
THREE weeks went by.
One afternoon when I went to Rusterman's Restaurant to see Marko

 Vukcic he signed the checks I had brought, for telephone and electricity bills and my weekly salary, and then asked me what the bank balance was. I told him a little over twenty-nine thousand dollars, but I sort of regarded Mrs. Rackham's ten grand as being in escrow, so I would rather call it nineteen.

Without looking up I told him no.
He pressed the button twice - the beer signal - leaned back, and frowned at me. I didn't see the frown, absorbed as I was in the dictionary, but it was in his tone of voice.
"What are you looking up?" he demanded.
"Oh, just a word," I said casually. "Checking up on our client. I thought she was illiterate, her calling you handsome - remember? But, by gum, it was merely an understatement. Here it is, absolutely kosher: 'Handsome: moderately large.' For an example it gives 'a handsome sum of money.' So she was dead right, you're a handsome detective, meaning a moderately large detective." I closed the dictionary and returned it to its place, remarking cheerfully, "Live and learn!"

==> t was a dud. Ordinarily that would have started him tossing phrases and adjectives, but he was occupied. Maybe he didn't even hear me. When Fritz came from the kitchen with the beer, Wolfe, taking from a drawer the gold bottle opener that a pleased client had given him, spoke. <==
"Fritz, good news. We're getting some of Mr. Darst's sausage - four pounds." Fritz let his eyes gleam. "Ha! Today?"
"Any moment." Wolfe poured beer. "That raises the question of cloves again. What do you think?"
"I'm against it," Fritz said firmly.
Wolfe nodded. "I think I agree. I think I do. You may remember what Marko Vukcic said last year - and by the way, he must be invited for a taste of this. For Monday luncheon?"
"That would be possible," Fritz conceded, "but we have arranged for shad with roe - "

"Of course." Wolfe lifted his glass and drank, put it down empty, and used his handkerchief on his lips. That, he thought, was the only way for a man to scent a handkerchief. "We'll have Marko for the sausage at Monday dinner, followed by duck Mondor." He leaned forward and wiggled a finger.

"Now about the shallots and fresh thyme: there's no use depending on Mr. Colson. We might get diddled again. Archie will have to go - "
At that point Archie had to go answer the doorbell, which I was glad to do.

I fully appreciate, mostly anyhow, the results of Wolfe's and Fritz's pow-wows on grub when it arrives at the table, but the gab often strikes me as overdone. So I didn't mind the call to the hall and the front door. There I found a young man with a pug nose and a package, wearing a cap that said "Fleet Messenger Service." I signed the slip, shut the door, started back down the hall, and was met not only by Fritz but by Wolfe too, who can move well enough when there's something he thinks is worth moving for.
He took the package from me and headed for the kitchen, followed by Fritz and

The small carton was sealed with tape. In the kitchen Wolfe put it on the long table, reached to the rack for a knife, cut the tape, and pulled the flaps up. My reflexes are quick, and the instant the hissing noise started I grabbed Wolfe's arm to haul him back, yelling at Fritz, "Watch out! Drop!"
Wolfe can move all right, considering what he has to move. He and I went through the open door into the hall before the explosion came, and Fritz came bounding after, pulling the door with him. We all kept going, along the short stretch of hall to the office door, and into the office. There we stopped dead. No explosion yet.

"It's still hissing," I said, and moved. "Come back here'" Wolfe commanded.

I arose, returned to the office on my feet, and told them. "Gas. Tear gas, I think. The hissing has stopped."
Wolfe snorted.

I marched to the hall and shut the door behind me, went and opened the front door wide, came back and stood at the kitchen door and took a full breath, opened the door, raced through and opened the back door into the courtyard, and ran back again to the front. Even there the air current was too gassy for comfort, so I moved out to the stoop. I had been there only a moment when I heard my name called.
"Archie!"

I turned. Wolfe's head with its big oblong face was protruding from a window of the front room.

I turned. Wolfe's head with its big oblong face was protruding from a window of the front room.
"Yes, sir," I said brightly.
"Who brought that package?"
I told him Fleet Messenger Service.
==> When the breeze through the hall had cleared the air I returned to the kitchen and Fritz joined me - We gave the package a look and found it was quite simple: a metal cylinder with a valve, with a brass rod that had been adjusted so that when the package was opened so was the valve. There was still a strong smell, close up, and Fritz took it to the basement. I went to the office and found Wolfe behind his desk, busy at the phone. I dropped into my chair and dabbed at my runny eyes with my handkerchief. When he hung up I asked, "Any luck?" <==
"I didn't expect any," he growled. "Right. Shall I call a cop?"
"No."
I nodded. "The question was rhetorical." I dabbed at my eyes some more, and blew my nose. "Nero Wolfe does not call cops. Nero Wolfe opens his own packages of sausage and makes his own enemies bite the dust" I blew my nose again. "Nero Wolfe is a man who will go far if he opens one package too many. Nero Wolfe has never - "
"The question was not rhetorical," Wolfe said rudely. "That is not what rhetorical means."
"No? I asked it. I meant it to be rhetorical. Can you prove that I don't know what rhetorical means?" I blew my nose. "When you ask me a question, which God knows is often, do I assume - "

'Yes, My nerve is gone. If public servants and other respected citizens take orders from this man, why shouldn't I?"
"You damn faker," I said indulgently. "You know perfectly well that I would

 rather eat soap than have you think I would knuckle under to that son of a bitch, and I know that you would rather put horseradish on oysters than have me think you would. I might if you didn't know about it, and you might if I didn't know about it, but as it is we're stuck."
Wolfe sighed again, deeper. "I take it that you're going?"
==> "I am. But under one condition, that the trepidant vigilance begins as of now. That you call Fritz in, and Theodore down from the plant rooms, and tell them what we're up against, and the chain bolts are to be kept constantly on both doors, and you keep away from windows, and nothing and no one is to be allowed to enter when I'm not here." <==
"Good heavens," he objected sourly, "that's no way to live."
"You can't tell till you try it. In ten years you may like it fine." I buzzed the plant rooms on the house phone to get Theodore.
Wolfe sat scowling at me.

WHEN, swinging the car off Taconic State Parkway to hit Route 100, my dash clock said only 2:40, I decided to make a little detour. It would be only a couple of miles out of my way. So at Pines Bridge I turned right, instead of left across the bridge. It wouldn't serve my purpose to make for the entrance to the estate where EASTCREST was carved on the great stone pillar, since all I would see there was a driveway curving up through the woods, and I turned off a mile short of that to climb a bumpy road up a hill. At the top the road went straight for a stretch between meadows, and I eased the car off onto the grass, stopped, and took the binoculars and aimed them at the summit of the next hill, somewhat higher than the one I was on, where the roof and upper walls of a stone mansion showed above the trees. Now, in early April, with no leaves yet, and with the binoculars, I could see most of the mansion and even something of the surrounding grounds, and a couple of men moving about.

He still stood, as if there was something else on his mind. There was, and
he unloaded it.
"It happens in the best families," he stated distinctly and backed out,
taking the door with him.
I closed my eyes but made no effort to empty my head. If I went to sleep
==> there was no telling when I would wake up, and I intended to phone Wolfe at eight, fifteen minutes before the scheduled hour for Fritz to get to his room with his breakfast tray. Meanwhile I would think of something brilliant to do or to suggest. The trouble with that, I discovered after some poking around, was that I had no in. Nobody would speak to me except Leeds, and he was far from loquacious. <==
I have a way of realizing all of a sudden, as I suppose a lot of people do, that I made a decision some time back without knowing it. It happened that morning at 6:25. Looking at my watch and seeing that that was where it had got to, I was suddenly aware that I was staying awake, not so I could phone Wolfe at eight o'clock, but so I could beat it the hell out of there as soon as I was sure Leeds was asleep; and I was now as sure as I would ever be.
I got up and shed my pajamas and dressed, not trying to set a record but

 wasting no time, and, with my bag in one hand and my shoes in the other, tiptoed to the hall, down the stairs, and out to the stone slab. While it wasn't Calvin Leeds I was escaping from, I thought it desirable to get out of Westchester County before anyone knew I wasn't upstairs asleep. Not a chance.
I was seated on the stone slab tying the lace of the second shoe when a dog barked, and that was a signal for all the others. I scrambled up, grabbed the bag, ran to the car and unlocked it and climbed in, started the engine, swung around the graveled space, and passed the house on my way out just as Leeds emerged through the side door. I stepped on the brake, stuck my head through the window, yelled at him, "Got an errand to do, see you later!" and rolled on through the gate and into the highway.

At that hour Sunday morning the roads were all mine, the bright new sun was at my left out of the way, and it would have been a pleasant drive if I had been in a mood to feel pleased. Which I wasn't. This was a totally different situation from the other two occasions when we had crossed Arnold Zeck's path and someone had got killed. Then the corpses had been Zeck's men, and Zeck, Wolfe, and the public interest had all been on the same side. This time Zeck's man, Barry Rackham, was the number one suspect, and Wolfe had either to return his dead client's ten grand, keep it without doing anything to earn it, or meet Zeck head on. Knowing Wolfe as I did, I hit eighty-five that morning rolling south on the Sawmill River Parkway.
The dash clock said 7:18 as I left the West Side Highway at 46th Street.
I had to cross to Ninth Avenue to turn south. It was as empty as the country roads had been. Turning right on 35th, I went on across Tenth Avenue, on nearly to Eleventh, and pulled to the curb in front of Wolfe's old brown-stone house. Even before I killed the engine I saw something that made me goggle - a sight that had never greeted me before in the thousands of rimes I had braked a car to a stop there.
The front door was standing wide open.

==> MY HEART came up. I swallowed it down, jumped out, ran across the sidewalk and up the seven steps to the stoop and on in. Fritz and Theodore were there in the hall, coming to me. Their faces were enough to make a guy's heart pop right out of his mouth. <==
"Airing the house?" I demanded.


"He's gone," Fritz said.
"Gone where?"

"I don't know. During the night. When I saw the door was open - " "What's that in your hand?"
"He left them on the table in his room - for Theodore and me, and one for you - "
I snatched the pieces of paper from his trembling hand and looked at the one on top. The writing on it was Wolfe's.
Dear Fritz;

Marko Vukcic will want your services. He should pay you at least $2000 a month.
My best regards....
Nero Wolfe
I looked at the next one.

==> I went through them again, watching each word, told Fritz and Theodore, "Come and sit down," went to the office, and sat at my desk. They moved chairs to face me, "He's gone," Fritz said, trying to convince himself. <==
"So it seems," I said aggressively.
"You know where he is," Theodore told me accusingly. "It won't be easy to move some of the plants without damage. I don't like working on Long Island, not for two hundred dollars a week. When is he coming back?"
"Look, Theodore," I said, "I don't give a good goddam what you like or don't like. Mr. Wolfe has always pampered you because you're the best orchid nurse alive. This is as good a time as any to tell you that you remind me of sour

 milk. I do not know where Mr. Wolfe is nor if or when he's coming back. To you he sent his regards. To me he sent his very best regards and wishes. Now shut up."

==> I shifted to Fritz. "He thinks Marko Vukcic should pay you twice as much as he does. That's like him, huh? You can see I'm sore as hell, his doing it like this, but I'm not surprised. To show you how well I know him, this is what happened: not long after I phoned him last night he simply wrote these notes to us and walked out of the house, leaving the door open - you said you found it open - to show anyone who might be curious that there was no longer anyone or anything of any importance inside. You got up at your usual time, six-thirty, saw the open door, went up to his room, found his bed empty and the notes on the table. After going up to the plant rooms to call Theodore, you returned to his room, looked around, and discovered that he had taken nothing with him. Then you and Theodore stared at each other until I arrived. Have you anything to add to that?" <==
"I don't want to work on Long Island," Theodore stated.
Fritz only said, "Find him, Archie."
"He told me not to."
"Yes - but find him! Where will he sleep? What will he eat?"
I got up and went to the safe and opened it, and looked in the cash drawer,

To show you how well I know him, this is what happened: not long after I phoned him last night he simply wrote these notes to us and walked out of the house, leaving the door open - you said you found it open - to show anyone who might be curious that there was no longer anyone or anything of any importance inside. You got up at your usual time, six-thirty, saw the open door, went up to his room, found his bed empty and the notes on the table. After going up to the plant rooms to call Theodore, you returned to his room, looked around, and discovered that he had taken nothing with him. Then you and Theodore stared at each other until I arrived. Have you anything to add to that?"
"I don't want to work on Long Island," Theodore stated.
==> Fritz only said, "Find him, Archie." <==
"He told me not to."
"Yes - but find him! Where will he sleep? What will he eat?"
I got up and went to the safe and opened it, and looked in the cash drawer,
where we always kept a supply for emergency expenses. There should have been a little over four thousand bucks; there was a little over a thousand. I closed the safe door and twirled the knob, and told Fritz, "He'll sleep and eat. Was my report accurate?"
"Not quite. One of his bags is gone, and pajamas, toothbrush, razor, three shirts, and ten pairs of socks."

"No. The old gray topcoat and the old gray hat."
"Were there any visitors?"
"No."

but you know I don't answer when you're out unless he tells me to. It rang only once, at eight minutes after twelve."
"Your clock's wrong. That was me. It was five after." I went and gave him a pat on the shoulder. "Okay. I hope you like your new job. How's chances for some breakfast?"
"But Archie! His breakfast ..."
"I could eat that too. I drove forty miles on an empty stomach." I patted

==>  him again. "Look, Fritz. Right now I'm sore at him, damn sore. After some griddle cakes and broiled ham and eight or ten eggs in black butter and a quart of coffee, we'll see. I think I'll be even sorer than I am now, but we'll see. Is there any of his favorite honey left that you haven't been giving me lately? The thyme honey?" <==
"Yes - some. Four jars."
"Good. I'll finish off with that on a couple of hot cakes. Then we'll see how I feel."
"I would never have thought - " Fritz's voice had a quaver, and he stopped and started over again. "I would never have thought this could happen. What is it, Archie?" He was practically wailing. "What is it? His appetite has been good."
"We were going to repot some Miltonias today," Theodore said dismally.
I snorted. "Go ahead and pot 'em. He was no help anyhow. Beat it and let me alone. I've got to think. Also I'm hungry. Beat it!"

I snorted. "Go ahead and pot 'em. He was no help anyhow. Beat it and let me alone. I've got to think. Also I'm hungry. Beat it!"
Theodore, mumbling, shuffled out. Fritz, following him, turned at the door. "That's it, Archie. Think. Think where he is while I get your breakfast."
He left me, and I sat down at my desk to do the thinking, but the cogs wouldn't catch. I was too mad to think. "Don't look for me." That was him to a T. He knew damn well that if I should ever come home to find he had vanished, the one activity that would make any sense at all would be to start looking for him, and here I was stopped cold at the take-off. Not that I had no notion at all. That was why I had left Leeds' place without notice and stepped it up to eighty-five getting back: I did have a notion. Two years had passed since Wolfe had told me, "Archie, you are to forget that you know that man's name. If ever, in the course of my business, I find that I am committed against him and must destroy him, I shall leave this house, find a place where I can work - and sleep and eat if there is time for it - and stay there until I have finished."
So that part was okay, but what about me? On another occasion, a year later, he had said to five members of a family named Sperling, in my presence, "In that event he will know it is a mortal encounter, and so will I, and I shall move to a base of operations which will be known only to Mr. Goodwin and perhaps two others." Okay. There was no argument with the mortal encounter or about the move. But I was the Mr. Goodwin referred to, and here I was staring at it - "Don't look for me." Where did that leave me? Certainly the two others he had had in mind were Saul Panzer and Marko Vukcic, and I didn't even dare to phone Saul and ask a couple of discreet questions; and besides, if he had let Saul in and left me out, to hell with him. And what was I supposed to say to people - for instance, people like the District Attorney of Westchester County?

And what was I supposed to say to people - for instance, people like the District Attorney of Westchester County?
That particular question got answered, partly at least, from an unexpected

 quarter. When I had finished with the griddle cakes, ham, eggs, thyme honey, and coffee, I went back to the office to see if I was ready to quit feeling and settle down to thinking, and was working at it when I became aware that I was sitting in Wolfe's chair behind his desk. That brought me up with a jerk. No one else, including me, ever sat in that chair, but there I was. I didn't approve of it. It seemed to imply that Wolfe was through with that chair for good, and that was a hell of an attitude to take, no matter how sore I was. I opened a drawer of his desk to check its contents, pretending that was what I had sat there for, and was starting a careful survey when the doorbell rang.

if I can get a story on it!"
"Don't you believe your own ads? It says that Mr. Wolfe will not hereafter
be available." I had the door swung to a narrow gap. "I never saw you before, but Lon Cohen is an old friend of mine. He gets to work at noon, doesn't he?"
"Yes, but - "
"Tell him not to bother to phone about this. Mr. Wolfe is not available, and I'm reserved for clients, as the ad says. Watch your foot, here comes the door."
==> I shut it and put the chain bolt on. As I went back down the hall Fritz emerged from the kitchen and demanded, "Who was that?" <==
I eyed him. "You know damn well," I said, "that when Mr. Wolfe was here you would never have dreamed of asking who was that, either of him or of me. Don't dream of it now, anyway not when I'm in the humor I'm in at present."
"I only wanted - "
"Skip it. I advise you to steer clear of me until I've had a chance to think." I went to the office and this time took my own chair. At least I had got
some instructions from Wolfe, though his method of sending them was certainly

==>  roundabout. The ad meant, of course, that I wasn't to try to cover his absence; on the contrary. More important, it told me to lay off of the Rackham thing. I was to handle inquiries from clients on unfinished matters, but only from clients; and since Mrs. Rackham, being dead, couldn't inquire, that settled that. Another thing - apparently I still had my job, unlike Fritz and Theodore. But I couldn't sign checks, I couldn't - suddenly I remembered something. The fact that I hadn't thought of it before indicates the state I was in. I have told, in my account of another case of Wolfe's how, in anticipation of the possibility that some day a collision with Arnold Zeck would drive him into a foxhole, he had instructed me to put fifty thousand dollars in cash in a safe deposit box over in Jersey, and how I obeyed instructions. The idea was to have a source of supply for the foxhole; but anyway, there it was, fifty grand, in the box rented by me under the name I had selected for the purpose. I was sitting thinking how upset I must have been not to have thought of that before when the phone rang and I reached for it. <==
"Nero Wolfe's office, Archie Goodwin speaking."
I thought it proper to use that, the familiar routine, since according to Wolfe's ad he wouldn't retire until the next day.
"Archie?" A voice I knew sounded surprised. "Is that you, Archie?" "Right. Hello, Marko. So early on Sunday?"
"But I thought you were away! I was going to give Fritz a message for
you. From Nero."

Marko Vukcic, owner and operator of Rusterman's Restaurant, the only
place where Wolfe really liked to eat except at home, was the only man in New York who called Wolfe by his first name. I told him I would be glad to take a message for myself.
"Not from Nero actually," he said. "From me. I must see you as soon as possible. Could you come here?"
I said I could. There was no need to ask where, since the only place he could ever be found was the restaurant premises, either on one of the two floors for the public, in the kitchen, or up in his private quarters.

==> I told Fritz I was going out and would be back when he saw me. <==
As I drove crosstown and up to 54th Street, I was around eighty per cent sure that within a few minutes I would be talking with Wolfe. For him it would be hard to beat that for a foxhole - the place that cooked and served the best food in America, with the living quarters of his best and oldest friend above it. Even after I had entered at the side door, as arranged, ascended the two flights of stairs, seen the look on Marko's face as he welcomed me, felt the tight clasp of his fingers as he took my hands in his, and heard his murmured "My friend, my poor young friend!" - even then I thought he was only preparing dramatically to

 lead me to Wolfe in an inner room.
But he wasn't. All he led me to was a chair by a window. He took another one, facing me, and sat with his palms on his knees, his head cocked a little to one side as usual.
"My friend Archie," he said sympathetically. "It is my part to tell you exactly certain things. But before I do that I wish to tell you a thing of my own. I wish to remind you that I have known Nero a much longer time than you have. We knew each other as boys in another country - much younger than you were that day many years ago when you first saw him and went to work for him. He is my old and dear friend, and I am his. So it was natural that he should come to me last night."

to tell you, and these things. Do you want to write them down?"
"I can remember them if you can. Shoot."
Marko nodded. "I know of your great memory. Nero has often spoken of
it." He shut his eyes and in a moment opened them again. "There are these five things. First, the plants. He telephoned Mr. Hewitt last night, and tomorrow Mr. Hewitt will arrange for the plants to be moved to his place, and also for Theodore to go there to work. Second - "
"Am I to list the plants? Do the records go too?"
==> "I don't know. I can say only what I was told to say. That's all about the plants. Perhaps Mr. Hewitt can tell you. Second, that is Fritz. He will work here, and I will pay him well. I will see him today and arrange the details. Of course he is unhappy?" <==
"He thinks Mr. Wolfe will starve to death."
"But naturally. If not that, something else. I have always thought it a folly for him to be a detective. Third - I am third. I have a power of attorney. Do you want to see it?"
"No, thanks, I'll take your word for it."
"It is in there locked up. Nero said it is legal, and he knows. I can sign checks for you. I can sign anything. I can do anything he could do."
"Within certain limits. You can't - " I waved a hand. "Forget it. Fourth?"

"Where he went? Where he is? No word for me at all?"
"Nothing. Only what I have told you."
"Hell, he's gone batty, like lots of geniuses," I declared, and got up to go.
VII
I DROVE around for two solid hours, mostly in the park. Now and then, for a change of scene, I left the park for a patrol of the avenues.
==> I hadn't been able to start thinking in the house, and it might work better on the move. Moreover, I didn't want any more just then of Fritz or Theodore, or in fact of anybody but me. So, in the light of experience and guided by intelligence, I drove around. Somewhere along the way I saw clearly what my trouble was: I was completely out of errands for the first time in years. How could I decide what to do when I had nothing to do? I now believe that the <==

ason I never drove farther north than 40th Street, nor farther south than i4th Street during those two hours, was that I thought Wolfe was probably somewhere within those limits and I didn't want to leave them.
When I did leave them it wasn't voluntary. Rolling down Second Avenue in the Seventies, I had stopped for a red light abreast of a police car on my left. Just as the light was changing, the cop on my side stuck his head out and called, "Pull over to the curb."
Flattered at the attention as any motorist would be, not, I obeyed. The police car came alongside, and the cop got out and invented another new phrase. "Let me see your license."
I got it out and handed it to him, and he took a look.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 710    window = 705 715

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34727    window = 34722 34732




"Let me talk to him."
That was satisfactory. I liked that all right, except for one thing. After the
Westchester dick was finished on the phone and it was settled that I would roll my own, and the sergeant had generously said that the Police Department would contribute the phone call, I asked the dick if he understood that I didn't care to be
==> tailed, and he replied that I needn't worry because he was going back to 35th Street to see Nero Wolfe. I didn't care much for that, but said nothing because I hadn't yet decided exactly what to say. So when I found a place on Lexington Avenue for a sandwich and a malted, I went first to a phone booth, called the house, and told Fritz to leave the chain bolt on, tell callers that Wolfe was out of the city and no more, and admit no one. <==
Being on the move did help. Having decided, while touring the park and avenues, what my immediate trouble was, I now, on my way to Birchvale, got the whole thing into focus. Considering the entire picture, including the detail of putting the house up for sale and the lack of even one little hint for me, let alone a blueprint, it was by no means a bet that Wolfe had merely dived into a foxhole. Look how free Marko had been with his poor-young-friending. It was not inconceivable that Wolfe had decided to chuck it for good. A hundred times and more, when things or people - frequently me - didn't suit him, he had told me about the house he owned in Egypt and how pleasant it would be to live there. I had always brushed it off. I now realized that a man who is eccentric enough to threaten to go and live in Egypt is eccentric enough to do it, especially when it gets to the point where he opens a package of sausage and has to run for his life.
Therefore I would be a dimwit to assume that this was merely time out to gather ammunition and make plans. Nor could I assume that it wasn't. I couldn't assume anything. Was he gone for good, or was he putting on a charade that would make all his other performances look like piker stuff in comparison? Presumably I was to answer that question, along with others, by the light of experience guided by intelligence, and I did not appreciate the compliment. If I was finally and permanently on my own, very well; I would make out. But apparently I was still drawing pay, so what? The result of my getting the whole picture into focus was that as I turned in at the entrance to Birchvale I was sorer than ever.
I was stopped at the entrance by one of Noonan's colleagues, there on guard, and was allowed to proceed up the curving drive only after I had shown him four documents. Parking in a space at the side of the house that was bordered by evergreens, I walked around to the front door and was admitted by a maid who looked pale and puffy. She didn't say anything, just held the door open, but a man was there too, one of the county boys whom I knew by sight but

 not by name. He said, "This way," and led me to the right, to the same small room I had seen before.

"I told him what had happened. I reported, as fully as I could in the time I had, everything from my arrival here up to then. If the operator listened in you can check with her. I asked if I should limit my talk with the cops to events here and leave the rest for him to tell, and he said no, I should withhold nothing, including all details of Mrs. Rackham's talk with him. That was all. As you know, I followed instructions."
"Jesus," Dykes said. "Son, it looks like your turn to sweat has come."
Archer ignored him. "And after telling you to withhold nothing from the police, Wolfe suddenly decides, in the middle of the night, that he has had enough of detective work, sends an ad to a newspaper announcing his retirement, calls on a friend to arrange for the care of his orchids - and what did he do then? I was so engrossed I may have missed something."
"I don't know what he did. He walked out. He disappeared."
I was aware, of course, of how it sounded. It was completely cuckoo. It was all rayon and a yard wide. I damn near made it even worse by telling them about the sausage and the tear gas, of course without letting on that we knew who had sent it, but realized in time how that would go over in the circumstances. That would have made a hit. But I had to say or do something, and decided to produce evidence, so I reached to my pocket for it.
==> "He left notes on the table in his bedroom," I said, "for Fritz and Theodore and me. Here's mine." <==
I handed it to Archer. He read it and passed it to Dykes, Dykes read it twice and returned it to Archer, who stuck it in his pocket.
"Jesus," Dykes said again, looking at me in a way I didn't like. "This is really something. I've always thought Nero Wolfe had a lot on the ball, and you too in a way, but this is about the worst I ever saw. Really." He turned to Archer.

 "It's plain what happened."
"It certainly is." Archer made a fist. "Goodwin, I don't ask you to tell me. I'll tell you. When you found Mrs. Rackham there dead, you and Leeds agreed on a tale about the visit to Nero Wolfe. Leeds came here to break the news. You went to his place to phone Wolfe and report, both the murder and the tale you and Leeds had agreed on - or maybe Wolfe knew that already, since you had pretended to investigate the dog poisoning. In any case, Wolfe knew something that he didn't dare to try to cover and that, equally, he didn't dare to reveal. What made it unbearably hot was the murder. So he arranged to disappear, and we haven't got him, and it may take a day or a week to find him. But we've got you."

THE jail at White Plains uses a gallon of strong disinfectant, diluting it, of course, every day including Sunday. I can back that statement up with two pieces of evidence: the word of the turnkey on the second-floor cell block, whose name is Wilkes, given to me personally, and my sense of smell, which is above average.
I had no opportunity to make a tour of inspection during the twenty hours I was there, that Easter Sunday and the day following, but except for the smell I found nothing to write to the newspapers about, once you grant that society must

 protect itself against characters like me. My cell - or rather, our cell, since I had a mate - was as clean as they come. There was something about the blankets that made you keep them away from your chin, but that could have been just prejudice. The light was nothing wonderful, but good enough to read by for thirty days.
==> I didn't really get acquainted with my surroundings or my mate until Monday, I was so darned sleepy when they finally finished with me down below and showed me up to my room. They had been insistent but not ferocious. I had been allowed to phone Fritz that I wouldn't be home, which was a good thing, as there was no telling what he would have done with no word from me coming on top of Wolfe's fadeout, and also to try to call Nathaniel Parker, the only lawyer Wolfe has ever been willing to invite to dinner; but that was no go because he was away for the weekend. When at last I stretched out on the cot, I was dead to the world ten seconds after my head hit the pillow, consisting of my pants wrapped in my shirt. <==
It was the pants, or rather the coat and vest that went with them, that made my stay pleasanter than it might have been right from the start. I had had perhaps half as much sleep as I could have used when a hell of a noise banged at me and I lifted my head and opened my eyes. Across the cell on another cot, so far away that I would have had to stretch my arm its full length to touch him, was my cellmate - a broad - shouldered guy about my age, maybe a little older, with a mop of tousled black hair. He was sitting up, yawning.
"What's all the racket?" I asked. "Jail break?"
"Breakfast and check-up in ten minutes," he replied, getting his feet, with socks on, to the floor. "Stupid custom."
"Boneheads," I agreed, twisting up to sit on the edge of the cot.
Going to the chair where his wardrobe was, his eye fell on my chair, and he stepped to it for a look at the coat and vest. He fingered the lapel, looked inside at the lining, and inspected a buttonhole. Then, without comment, he returned to his side, two whole steps, and started to dress. I followed suit.

"As you say," the turnkey said distinctly, and went. My mate, getting his
necktie under his shirt collar, told me, "They won't allow exceptions to the turnout and check-up, but you can pass up the garbage. We'll eat here in privacy."
"This," I said earnestly, "is the brotherhood of man. I would like this breakfast to be on me when I get my wallet back."
He waved it away. "Forget it."
The turnout and check-up, I discovered, were not to be taken as opportunities for conversation. There were around forty of us, all shapes and sizes, and on the whole we were frankly not a blue-ribbon outfit. The smell of the breakfast added to the disinfectant was enough to account for the expressions on the faces, not counting whatever it was that had got them there, and it was a relief to get back to my cozy cell with my mate.
==> We had our hands and faces washed, and he had his teeth brushed, when the breakfast came on a big clean aluminum tray. The eats were barely usable if you took Fritz's productions as a standard, but compared with the community meal which I had seen and smelled they were a handsome feast. <==
My mate having ordered two of everything, there were two morning Gazettes, and before he even touched his orange juice he took his paper and, with no glance at the front page, turned to sports. Finishing his survey of the day's prospects, he drank some orange juice and inquired, "Are you interested in the rapidity of horses?"
"In a way." I added earnestly, "I like the way you talk. I enjoy being with cultured people."
He gave me a suspicious look, saw my honest candid countenance, and relaxed. "That's natural. Look at your clothes."
We were on the chairs, with the little wooden table between us. It was comfortable enough except that there was no room to prop up our morning papers. He flattened his out, still open at sports, on the end of the cot, and turned to it while disposing of a bite of food. I arranged mine, front page, on my knee. In the picture of Mrs, Rackham the poor woman looked homelier than she had actually been, which was a darned shame even though she wasn't alive to see it. Wolfe's name and mine both appeared in the sub-heads under the three-column spread about the murder. I glanced at the bottom, followed the instruction to turn to page four, and there saw more pictures. The one of Wolfe was only fair,

"Go to hell," I advised him, and marched off. I couldn't really blame the Westchester bunch, but Parker should have known me well enough to tell which side of my mouth I was talking out of. It's damn discouraging, when you do tell the truth, not to have it recognized.
Also discouraging was the welcome I got on entering Wolfe's house that evening. It was in the form of a note stuck in the corner of my desk blotter, unfolded.
Dear Archie -
I am sorry you are in jail and hope it will not last long. Mr. Vukcic has been to see me and I am leaving now to go to work for him $1500 - There has been no word from Mr. Wolfe. God grant he is safe and well and I think you should find him no matter what he wrote. I threw out the jar of sardines and stopped the milk. My very best regards and wishes,

==> Fritz <==
1:35 PM
I was pleased to observe that he stuck to routine to the end, putting the time down. Also it was nice of him to end his note to me the same as Wolfe had ended his. Nevertheless, it was a discouraging welcome home after a night in the hoosegow. And there had been a period of more than five hours when any phone calls that might have come would not have been answered, something that had never happened before in all the years I had worked and lived there. Unless Theodore ...
I beat it to the stairs and up the three flights, and entered the plant rooms.
One step inside the first room, the warm one, I stopped and surveyed. It was more of a shock, somehow, than it had been a year ago when it had been used as a target for tommy guns from across the street. Then they had at least left a mess; now there was nothing but the benches and stands. It really got me for a minute. I moved on through: medium room, cool room, potting room, spray chamber, Theodore's room - all empty. Hewitt must have sent an army to dean all that out in one day, I thought, heading back downstairs.
In the kitchen was another longer note from Fritz, reporting phone calls that had come before he left and various minor matters. I opened the refrigerator and poked around, and settled for a jar of home-made pate, a hunk of Italian bread, Vermont cheese, and milk. As I sat working at it with an evening paper propped up before me, I kept listening for something - nothing in particular, just something. That had never been a noisy house, hut I had never known it anything like that quiet. Almost no cars went by, and the few that did must have been coasting in neutral.

My meal finished and things put away, I wandered into the dining room, office, front room, down to the basement to Fritz's room, up one flight to Wolfe's room, up another to my room.

"Ah! Archie! You escaped?"
"I'm out on bail." He seemed to want to shake hands, and I was willing. "Thanks for your note. How's the new job?"
"Terrible. I'm played up. Mr. Wolfe?"
"I know nothing about Mr. Wolfe. I ate half a jar of pate."
He stopped beaming. "Mr. Vukcic is going to sell this house."

"Where's Wolfe?"
"I don't know. Next, you call me a liar. Then I say I have been, but not now. Then you - "
"Nuts. Where is he, Archie?"
That cleared the atmosphere. Over the years he had called me Goodwin fifty times to one Archie. He called me Archie only when he wanted something awful bad or when he had something wrapped up that Wolfe had given him and his humanity overcame him. So we were to be mellow.
"Listen," I said, friendly but firm. "That routine is all right for people like district attorneys and state cops and the representatives of the press, but you're above it. Either I don't know where he is, or I do know but I'm sitting on it. What's the difference? Next question."
==> He took a cigar from his pocket, inspected it, rubbed it between his palms, and inspected it again. "It must be quite a thing," he remarked, not growling. "That ad in the paper. The plants gone. Fritz and Theodore gone. Vukcic listing the house for sale. I'm going to miss it, I am, never dropping in to see him sitting there thinking he's smarter than God and all His angels. Quite a thing, it must be. What is it?" <==
I said slowly and wearily, "Either I don't know what it is, or I do know but

 -"
"What about the sausage that turned into tear gas? Any connection?"
I am always ready for Inspector Cramer, in the light of experience guided by intelligence, and therefore didn't bat an eye. I merely cocked my head a little, met his gaze, and considered the matter until I was satisfied. "I doubt if it was Fritz," I stated. "Mr. Wolfe has him too well trained. But in the excitement Sunday morning, Mr. Wolfe being gone, Fritz told Theodore, and you got it out of Theodore." I nodded. "That must be it."

"Did the tear gas scare him out of his skin? Or out of his house, which is the same thing. Was that it?"
"It might have, mightn't it? A coward like him?"
"No." Cramer put the cigar between his teeth, tilted up. "No, there are plenty of things about Wolfe I can and do object to, but he's not a coward. There might have been something about that tear gas that would have scared anybody. Was there?"
"As far as I know, it was just plain tear gas, nothing fancy." I decided to shove a little. "You know, it's nice to have you here any time, just for company, but aren't you spreading out some? Your job is homicide, and the tear gas didn't even make us sick, let alone kill us. Also your job is in the County of New York, and Mrs. Rackham died in Westchester. I enjoy talking with you, but have you got credentials?"
He made a noise that could have been a chuckle. "That's more like it," he said, not sarcastically. "You're beginning to sound natural. I'll tell you. I'm here at the request of Ben Dykes, who would give all his teeth and one ear to clear up the Rackham case ahead of the state boys. He thinks that Archer, the DA, may have swallowed the idea that you and Leeds are lying too deep, and he came to me as an expert on Nero Wolfe, which God knows I am. He laid it all out for me and wanted my opinion."

"No, thanks, that'll do."
"I thought so. Next, the possibility that when you phoned Wolfe right after the body was found you told him something that gave him a line on the

 murderer, but it's tricky and he had to go outdoors to get his evidence, preparing to grandstand it for the front page. I told Dykes I would rule that out too. Wolfe is quite capable of a play like that, sure he is, but if that's all it amounted to, why move the plants out and put Frits to work in a restaurant and list the house for sale? He's colorful, but not that colorful. Mrs. Rackham only paid him ten thousand, about what I make a year. Why should he spend it having his orchids carted around?"
Cramer shook his head, "Not for my money. That leaves the third possibility: that something really did scare him. That there was something about Mrs. Rackham's murder, or anyhow connected with it, that he knew he couldn't handle sitting there in that chair, but for some reason he had to handle it. So he scooted. As you say, you either don't know where he is or you know and won't tell - and that's no help either way. Now I've got a lot to say about this possibility. You got time to listen?"
==> "I've got all day, but Fritz isn't here to get our lunch." <==
"We'll go without." He clasped his hands behind his head and shifted his center of gravity. "You know, Archie, sometimes I'm not as far behind as you think I am."
"Also sometimes I don't think you're as far behind as you think I do."
"That's possible. Anyhow, I can add. I think he got word direct from Arnold Zeck. Did he?"
"Huh? Who's Arnold Zeck? Did you just make it up?"
I knew that was a mistake the instant it was out of my mouth. Then I had to try to keep it from showing on my face, the realization that I had fumbled it, but whether that was a success or not - and I couldn't very well look in a mirror to find out - it was too late.

think I can write him or phone him."
"You didn't need to. I know it's not your fault, but where does it leave me?
Let me know any time you get a buyer for the house, and I'll move out."
I left him still wanting to argue.
I was not kidding myself that I had really cut loose, since I hadn't moved
==> my bed out, but the way I figured it a caretaker who is drawing no pay has a right to a room; and besides, Fritz was still sleeping there and we were splitting <==

 on the groceries for breakfast, and I didn't want to insult either him or my stomach by breaking that up.
I shall now have to specify when I say office - or, better, I'll say office when I mean Wolfe's office, and when I mean my Madison Avenue suite I'll say 1019. Monday morning, arriving at 1019 a little after ten, I rang the phone- answering service and was told that there had been no calls, and then dug into the morning mail, which consisted of a folder from a window-cleaning outfit. After giving it full consideration, I typed notes on my new stationery to some personal friends, and an official letter to the City of New York giving notice of my change of address as a licensed detective. I was sitting trying to think who else I might write to when the phone rang - my first incoming call.
I picked it up and told the transmitter plainly, "Archie Goodwin's office." "May I speak to Mr. Goodwin, please?"
"I'll see if he's in. Who is calling, please?"

"I do."
"And I described briefly the echelons of crime. First, the criminal himself - or gang. In the problem of disposal of the loot, or of protection against discovery and prosecution, he can seldom avoid dealing with others. He will need a fence, a lawyer, witnesses for an alibi, a channel to police or political influence - no matter what, he nearly always needs someone or something. He goes to one he knows, or knows about, one named A. A, finding a little difficulty, consults B. B may be able to handle it; if not, he takes it on to C. C is usually able to oblige, but when he isn't he communicates with D. Here we are getting close. D has access to Arnold Zeck, not only for the purpose described, but also in connection with one or more of the enterprises which Zeck controls."
Wolfe tapped his chest with a forefinger, a gesture I had never before seen him use, acquired evidently along with his pleats and whiskers. "I am a D, Archie."
"Congratulations."
"Thank you. Having earned them, I accept them. Look at me."
==> "Yeah, I am. Wait till Fritz sees you." <==
"If he ever does," Wolfe said grimly. "We have a chance, and that's all. If
all we needed were evidence of Zeck's complicity in felonies, there would be no problem; I know where it is and I could get it. But his defenses are everywhere, making him next to invulnerable. It would be fatuous to suppose that he could ever be convicted, and even if he were, he would still be living, so that wouldn't help any. Now that I am committed against him, and he knows it, there are only two possible outcomes - "
"How does he know it?"
"He knows me. Knowing me, he knows that I intend to get the murderer of Mrs. Rackham. He intends to prevent me. Neither - "
"Wait a minute. Admitting he knows that about Nero Wolfe, what about you as Roeder? You say you're a D. Then you're on Zeck's payroll."

 "Then we could be serious about it."
"Do you mean," Saul Panzer asked, "that the purpose is to get on his
nerves?"
"No. Play it straight. I only mean it's not life and death - until further
==> notice." I pushed my chair back and got up. "And now I wish to prove that being an employer hasn't changed me any. You may continue to call me Archie. You may come with me to Thirty-fifth Street, where we will find a poker deck, and Fritz will make five, and when we have finished I'll lend you carfare home." <==
For the record, I lost twelve dollars. Saul was the big winner. One hand, I had three nines and - but I'd better get on. Rackham was living at the Churchill, in an air-conditioned suite in the tower. During the first week we compiled quite a biography of him. He never stuck his nose outside before one o'clock, and once not until four. His ports of call included two banks, a law office, nine bars, two clubs, a barber shop, seven other shops and stores, three restaurants, three theaters, two night spots, and miscellaneous. He usually ate lunch with a man or men, and dinner with a woman. Not the same woman; three different ones during the week. As described by my operatives, they were a credit to their sex, to the American way of life, and to the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union.
I took on a little of it myself, but mostly I left it to the help. Not that I loafed. There were quite a few hours with Lily Rowan, off and on, both as a substitute for the trip to Norway, indefinitely postponed, and as a check on the soundness of the estimate of her I had given Wolfe. She caused me no qualms. Once when we were dancing she sighed for Pete, and once at her apartment she said she would love to help some more with my work, but when I tactfully made it plain that the detective business was not on our agenda she took it nicely and let it lay.
There were other things, including the reports on Rackham to be typed. Late every afternoon Max Christy called at my office to get the report of the day before, and he would sit and read it and ask questions. When he got critical, I would explain patiently that I couldn't very well post a man at the door of Rackham's suite to take pictures of all the comers and goers, and that we were scoring better than eighty per cent on all his hours outside, which was exceptional for New York tailing.
I had the advantage, of course, of having had the situation described to me by their Pete Roeder. They were worried a little about Westchester, but more about the city. Shortly after he had become a millionaire by way of a steak knife, whoever had used it, Rackham had got word to Zeck that he was no longer available for contacts. Brownie Costigan had got to Rackham, thinking to put the

"I'll ring you around noon to confirm it," I said, and stood up to go. He didn't come with me to the door, but under the circumstances I didn't hold it against him.


So that evening when Wolfe came to 1019 it appeared to be high time for
getting the false bottom in the brief case ready, and we went on until midnight, discussing the program from every angle and trying to cover every contingency. It's always worth trying, though it can never be done, especially not with a layout as tricky as that one.
==> Then the next morning, Tuesday, a monkey wrench, thrown all the way from White Plains, flew into the machinery and stopped it. I had just finished breakfast, with Fritz, when the phone rang and I went to the office to get it. It was the Westchester DA's office. The talk was brief. When I had hung up I sat a while, glaring at the phone, then with an exasperated finger dialed the Churchill's number. That talk was brief too. Finished with it, I held the button down for a moment and dialed another number. There had been only two buzzes when a voice came through a nose to me. <==
"Yes?"
"I'd like to speak to Mr. Roeder ."
"Talking."
"This is Goodwin. I've just had a call from White Plains to come to the
DA's office at once. I asked if I could count on keeping a two o'clock appointment and was told no. I phoned the Churchill and left a message that I had been called out of town for the day. I hope it can be tomorrow. I'll let you know as soon as I can."

"From here?"
"Yes."
I went to Zeck's desk and pulled one of the phones to me.
"Wait." I had never heard him so grim. "First get Marko's number. I want

"Now? For God's sake, now?"
"Yes. Now. A man has a right to have his satisfactions match his pains. I
wish to use Mr. Zeck's phone to tell Fritz to go home and get dinner ready." I dialed the operator.

THREE days later, Friday afternoon, I said to Wolfe, "Anyway, it's all over now, isn't it?"
"No, confound it," he said peevishly. "I still have to earn that fee."
It was six o'clock, and he had come down from the plant rooms with some more pointed remarks about the treatment the plants had got at Hewitt's place. The remarks were completely uncalled for. Considering the two journeys they had taken, out to Long Island and then hack again, the plants were in splendid shape, especially those hard to handle like the Miltonias and Phalaenopsis. Wolfe was merely trying to sell the idea, at least to himself, that the orchids had missed him.
Fritz might have been a mother whose lost little boy has been brought home after wandering in the desert for days, living on cactus pulp and lizards' tails. Wolfe had gained not an ounce less than ten pounds in seventy-two hours, in spite of all the activity of getting resettled, and at the rate he was going he would be back to normal long before Thanksgiving.

==> Fritz might have been a mother whose lost little boy has been brought home after wandering in the desert for days, living on cactus pulp and lizards' tails. Wolfe had gained not an ounce less than ten pounds in seventy-two hours, in spite of all the activity of getting resettled, and at the rate he was going he would be back to normal long before Thanksgiving. <==
The pleats in his face were already showing a tendency to spread out, and of course the beard was gone, and the slick had been shampooed out of his hair. I had tried to persuade him to stay in training, but he wouldn't even bother to put up an argument. He just spent more time than ever with Fritz, arranging about meals.
He had not got home for dinner Tuesday evening after all, in spite of the satisfaction he had got by putting in a call to Fritz on Zeck's phone. We were now cleaned up with Westchester, but it had not been simple. The death of Arnold Zeck had of course started a chain reaction that went both deep and wide, and naturally there had been an earnest desire to make goats out of Wolfe and me, but they didn't have a damn thing on us, and when word came from

 somewhere that Wolfe, during his association with Zeck, might have collected some facts that could be embarrassing to people who shouldn't be embarrassed, the attitude toward us changed for the better right away.
As for the scene that ended with the death of Zeck and Rackham, we were clean as a whistle. The papers in Roeder's brief case, which of course the cops took, proved nothing on anybody. By the time the cops arrived there had been no one on the premises but Wolfe and me and the two corpses. A hot search was on, especially for Schwartz and Harry, but so far no take. No elaborate lying was required; our basic story was that Wolfe, in his disguise as Roeder, had got in with Zeck in order to solve the murder of Mrs. Rackham, and the climax had come that afternoon when Zeck had put the screws on Rackham by saying that he had evidence that would convict him for killing his wife, and Rackham had pulled a gun, smuggled somehow past the sentinels, and had shot Zeck, and Schwartz and Harry had rushed in and drilled Rackham. It was surprising and gratifying to note how much of it was strictly true.

THREE days later, Friday afternoon, I said to Wolfe, "Anyway, it's all over now, isn't it?"
"No, confound it," he said peevishly. "I still have to earn that fee."
It was six o'clock, and he had come down from the plant rooms with some more pointed remarks about the treatment the plants had got at Hewitt's place. The remarks were completely uncalled for. Considering the two journeys they had taken, out to Long Island and then hack again, the plants were in splendid shape, especially those hard to handle like the Miltonias and Phalaenopsis.

So by Friday afternoon we were cleaned up with Westchester, as I thought, and therefore it was a minor shock when Wolfe said, "No, confound it, I still have to earn that fee."
I was opening my mouth to ask him how come, when the phone rang.

"Oh, you will? Then you can tell me now - "
"Not on the phone, Mrs. Frey. I'll be expecting you at nine."
When we had hung up I lifted the brows at him. "So that's what you meant
about earning that fee? Maybe?"
He grunted, irritated that he had to interrupt his convalescence for a job of

I got up to go to the kitchen, to tell Fritz we were having company and that refreshments might be required.

I WAS mildly interested when the six guests arrived - a little early, five to nine - in such minor issues as the present state of relations between Annabel Frey and the banker, Dana Hammond, and between Lina Darrow and the statesman, Oliver Pierce, and whether Calvin Leeds would see fit to apologize for his unjust suspicions about Wolfe and me.
To take the last first, Leeds was all out of apologies. The spring was in his step all right, but not in his manners. First to enter the office, he plumped himself down in the red leather chair, but I figured that Archer rated it ex officio and asked him to move, which he did without grace. As for the others, there was too much atmosphere to get any clear idea. They were all on speaking terms, but the problem that brought them there was in the front of their minds, so much so that no one was interested in the array of liquids and accessories that Fritz and I had arranged on the table over by the big globe. Annabel was in the most comfortable of the yellow chairs, to Archer's left; then, working toward me at my desk, Leeds and Lina Darrow; and Hammond and Pierce closest to me.
Wolfe's eyes swept the arc.

 except Mr. Leeds. I must be sure I have you straight." His eyes went along the line again. "I think I have. Now if you'll tell me what you want - you, Mrs. Frey, it was you who phoned me."
Annabel looked at the DA. "Shouldn't you, Mr. Archer?"

Leeds' head went forward, dropping, and his hands came up to cover his face. He made no sound, and no one else did either. The silence darted around us and into us, coming out from Leeds. Then Lina Darrow took in a breath with a sighing, sobbing sound, and Annabel got up and went to her.
"Take him, Mr. Archer," Wolfe said grimly. "I'm through with him, and it's about time."

I'M SITTING at a window overlooking a fiord, typing this on a new portable I bought for the trip. In here it's pleasant. It's late in the season for outdoors in Norway, but if you run hard to keep your blood going you can stand it. I got a letter yesterday which read as follows:
Dear Archie:
==> The chickens came from Mr. Haskins Friday, four of them, and they were satisfactory. Marko came to dinner. He misses Fritz, he says. I have given Fritz a raise. <==
Mr. Cramer dropped in for a talk one day last week. He made

 some rather pointed comments about you, but on the whole behaved himself tolerably.
I am writing this longhand because I do not like the way the man sent by the agency types.
Vanda peetersiana has a raceme 29 in. long. Its longest last year was 22 in.

I am writing this longhand because I do not like the way the man sent by the agency types.
Vanda peetersiana has a raceme 29 in. long. Its longest last year was 22 in.
We have found three snails in the warm room. I thought of mailing them to Mr. Hewkt but didn't.
Mr. Leeds hanged himself in the jail at White Plains yesterday and was dead when discovered. That of course cancels your promise to Mr. Archer to return in time for the trial, but I trust you will not use it as an excuse to prolong your stay.
==> We have received your letters and they were most welcome. I have received an offer of $315 for the furniture in your office but am insisting on $350. Fritz says he has written you. I am beginning to feel more like myself. <==
My best regards,

I let Lily read it. "Darn him anyhow," she said. "No message, not a mention of me. My Pete! Huh. Fickle Fatty."
"You'd be the last," I told her. "that he'd ever send a message to. You're the only woman that ever got close enough to him, at least in my time, to make him smell of perfume."

"Archie," he snapped. "If after all your promiscuous philandering you can't produce a woman to those specifications, I've misjudged you. It's risky to trust anyone at all, but any other way would be still riskier."
I had my lips puckered. "Ruth Brady?"
"No. She's an operative, and known. Out of the question."
"There's one who might take this as a substitute for a trip to Norway,
which is now out. I could ask her." "What's her name?"
==> "You know. Lily Rowan." <==


He made a face. "She is rich, intemperate, and notorious."
"Nuts. She is well-heeled and playful. You remember the time she helped
out with an upstate murderer. I have no further suggestions. Do I phone her?" "Yes."

"NOW."

precious, if he starts talking you must listen, because he is very shy and sensitive and therefore - did you say something?"
"I said shut up. I'm at my office. A man is here with me. We'll leave as soon as I hang up. I'll go alone to your place and wait for you outside your door. The man - "
"You won't have to wait. I can make it - "
"Shut up, please. Your first hour has started, so this is on my time. The man with me has a car with a driver parked down in front. He will be driven to the Flamingo Club and stop at the curb, and you will be waiting there in front, and when he opens the door you will climb in, not waiting for him to get out like

 a gentleman, because he won't. You will not speak to the driver, who, when you're inside, will proceed to your address, where you and the man will find me waiting at your door."
"Unless I get in the wrong car, and - "
"I'm telling you. It's a dark gray forty-eight Chewy two-door sedan. New York license OA six, seven, one, one, three. Got that?"
"Yes."
==> "I'll make it a dollar ten an hour. The man will call you Lily, and you will call him Pete. Joining him in the car and riding up to your place, you need not go to extremes, but it is important for the driver to get the idea that you are mighty glad to see Pete and that you are looking forward with pleasure to the next several hours with him. But - " <==
"Is it a reunion after a long absence?"
"I'll make it a dollar twenty an hour. I was about to say, you can leave it vague whether you last saw Pete a week ago or two months ago. You're just glad to be with him because you're so fond of him, but don't get thinking you're Paulette Goddard and ham it. Do it right. Pretend it's me. Which brings me to the crux. It's going to be an ordeal for you. Wait till you see Pete."
"What's the matter with him?"
"Everything. He's old enough to be your father and then some. He has whiskers, turning gray. His face is pleated. You will have to fight down the feeling that you're having a nightmare, and - "
"Archie! It's Nero Wolfe!"

 security number. I'll be waiting anxiously at your door."
I hung up and told Wolfe, "All set."
Out of his chair, he grunted. "You overdid it a little, perhaps? Nightmare, for instance?"
"Yes, sir," I agreed. "I get too enthusiastic." I glared at him, and he glared back.

at the door of Lily's penthouse apartment on East 63rd Street.
Wolfe didn't speak and wouldn't look at me. Lily shook hands with me, a
form of greeting we hadn't used for I don't know how long, then unlocked the door, and we entered. When her wrap and Wolfe's hat had been disposed of and we passed to the living room, she tossed her firecracker.
"Archie," she said, "I knew darned well that something would happen some day to make up for all the time I've wasted on you, I just felt it would."
I nodded. "Certainly. You'll show a profit on the night even if you feed us sandwiches, especially since Pete is a light eater. He's on a diet."

Wolfe, who had seated himself, cocked his head to frown at her - a first- rate performance.

"There's one hope," I suggested. "Marry her. She wouldn't betray her own
husband. And apparently in that one short ride uptown with her - "
I stopped abruptly. The face as a whole was no longer his, but the eyes
alone were enough to tell me when I had gone far enough.
"I'll tell you what I'll do," I offered. "I know her quite well. Two things
==> that could conceivably happen: first, you might go to Zeck tomorrow and tell him who you are, and second. Lily might spill it either thoughtfully or thoughtlessly. I'll bet you ten bucks the first happens as soon as the second." <==
He growled. "She's a woman."
"All right, bet me."
The bet didn't get made. Not that Wolfe came to my point of view about
Lily Rowan, but what could the poor son of a gun do? He couldn't even take to the bushes again and start all over. From that point on, though, up to the end, the strain was ten times worse for him than for me. It cramped his style some all that night, after Lily had gone off to bed and we talked in the living room until long after dawn. At six o'clock he went. Probably it would then have been safe for me to go too, since if they were enough interested in him to have posted a sentry outside the building he would almost certainly leave when Roeder did, but probabilities weren't good enough now, not after the picture Wolfe had given me and the program he had drawn up, so I took a good two-hour nap before leaving
for 35th Street and a bath and breakfast.

for 35th Street and a bath and breakfast.
At ten o'clock I was at 1019, starting at the phone to get hold of Saul and
Orrie and Fred.
I did not like it at all. The way Wolfe was getting set to play it, it looked to
me as if we had one chance in a thousand, and while that may be good enough to go ahead on when what you're after is to nail a guy on a charge, and if you muff

"Do you mean," Saul Panzer asked, "that the purpose is to get on his
nerves?"
"No. Play it straight. I only mean it's not life and death - until further
notice." I pushed my chair back and got up. "And now I wish to prove that being an employer hasn't changed me any. You may continue to call me Archie. You may come with me to Thirty-fifth Street, where we will find a poker deck, and Fritz will make five, and when we have finished I'll lend you carfare home."
For the record, I lost twelve dollars. Saul was the big winner. One hand, I had three nines and - but I'd better get on. Rackham was living at the Churchill, in an air-conditioned suite in the tower. During the first week we compiled quite a biography of him. He never stuck his nose outside before one o'clock, and once not until four. His ports of call included two banks, a law office, nine bars, two clubs, a barber shop, seven other shops and stores, three restaurants, three theaters, two night spots, and miscellaneous. He usually ate lunch with a man or men, and dinner with a woman. Not the same woman; three different ones during the week. As described by my operatives, they were a credit to their sex, to the American way of life, and to the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union.
==> I took on a little of it myself, but mostly I left it to the help. Not that I loafed. There were quite a few hours with Lily Rowan, off and on, both as a substitute for the trip to Norway, indefinitely postponed, and as a check on the soundness of the estimate of her I had given Wolfe. She caused me no qualms. Once when we were dancing she sighed for Pete, and once at her apartment she said she would love to help some more with my work, but when I tactfully made it plain that the detective business was not on our agenda she took it nicely and let it lay. <==
There were other things, including the reports on Rackham to be typed. Late every afternoon Max Christy called at my office to get the report of the day before, and he would sit and read it and ask questions. When he got critical, I would explain patiently that I couldn't very well post a man at the door of Rackham's suite to take pictures of all the comers and goers, and that we were scoring better than eighty per cent on all his hours outside, which was exceptional for New York tailing.
I had the advantage, of course, of having had the situation described to me by their Pete Roeder. They were worried a little about Westchester, but more about the city. Shortly after he had become a millionaire by way of a steak knife, whoever had used it, Rackham had got word to Zeck that he was no longer available for contacts. Brownie Costigan had got to Rackham, thinking to put the

 bee on him, and had been tossed out on his ear. The stink being raised in Washington on gambling and rackets, and the resulting enthusiasm in the office of the New York County District Attorney, had started an epidemic of jitters, and it was quite possible that if one of my typed reports had told of a visit by Rackham to the DA's office, or of one by an assistant DA to Rackham's suite, Rackham would have had a bad accident, like getting run over or falling into the river with lead in him. That was why Wolfe had given me careful and explicit instructions about what I should report and what I shouldn't.
I had no sight or sound of Wolfe. He was to let me know if and when there was something stirring, and I had been told how to reach him if I had to. Meanwhile I had my schedule, and on the ninth day, a Friday, the first of September, it called for a move. Things looked right for it. Saul, on instructions, had let himself get spotted once, and Orrie twice, and Fred, without instructions, at least three times. I too had cooperated by letting myself be seen at the entrance of the Crooked Circle one night as Rackham emerged with companions. So Friday at five o'clock, when Saul phoned that the subject had entered the

"Oh, for God's sake!" I said impatiently. "Have I impressed you as the son

 of boob who would jump off a building just to hear his spine crack? Yes, brother, I know who I'm dealing with, and I expect to live to ninety at least."
He straightened up. "Your chief trouble," he said, not offensively, "is that you think you've got a sense of humor. It confuses people, and you ought to get over it. Things strike you as funny. You thought it would be funny to have a talk with Rackham, and it may be all right this time, but some day something that you think is funny will blow your goddam head right off your shoulders."
Only after he had gone did it occur to me that that wouldn't prove it wasn't funny.
==> I had a date that Saturday evening with Lily Rowan, but decided to call it off. Evidently I wasn't tactful enough about it, for she took on. I calmed her down by promising to drown myself as soon as the present crisis was past, went home and got my dinner out of the refrigerator, and settled down in the office for another evening of not reading magazines. A little after nine the minutes were beginning to get too damn long entirely when the phone rang. It was Lily. <==
"All right," she said briskly, "come on up here."
"I told you - "
"I know, but now I'm telling you. I'm going to have company around
eleven, and as I understand it you're supposed to get here first. Get started." "Phooey. I'm flattered that you bothered to try it, but - "
"I wouldn't have dreamed of trying it. The company just phoned, and I'm

"I wouldn't have dreamed of trying it. The company just phoned, and I'm
following instructions. My God, are you conceited!"
"I'll be there in twenty minutes."
It took twenty-two, to her door. She was vindictive enough to insist that
there were three television programs she wouldn't miss for anything, which was just as well, considering my disposition. I suppose I might have adjusted to it in time, say ten years, but I was so used to having Wolfe right at hand any minute of the day or night when difficulties were being met that this business of having to sit it out until word came, and then rushing up to a friend's penthouse and waiting another hour and a half, was too much of a strain.
==> He finally arrived. I must admit that when the bell rang Lily, having promised to behave like a lady, did so. She insisted on opening the door for him, but having got him into the living room, she excused herself and left us. <==
He sat. I stood and looked at him. Eleven days had passed since our reunion, and I hadn't properly remembered how grotesque he was. Except for the eyes, he was no one I had ever seen or cared to see.
"What's the matter?" I asked peevishly. "You look as if you hadn't slept for a week."
"I'm a little tired, that's all," he growled. "I have too much to watch, and

 I'm starving to death. So far as I know everything at my end is satisfactory. What about Miss Rowan?"

 I'm starving to death. So far as I know everything at my end is satisfactory. What about Miss Rowan?"
"She's all right. As you may remember, every week or so I used to send her a couple of orchids of a kind that couldn't be bought. I have told her that the custom may be resumed some day provided we get this difficulty ironed out, and that it depends on her. Women like to have things depend on them."
He grunted. "I don't like to have things depend on them." He sighed.
"It can't be helped. I can only stay an hour. Bring me some of Miss Rowan's perfume."
==> I went and tapped on a door, got no answer, opened it and crossed a room to another door, tapped again, was told to enter, and did so. Lily was on a divan with a book. I told her what I wanted. <==
"Take the Houri de Perse," she advised. "Pete likes it. I had it on that night."
I got it from the dressing table, returned to the living room, aimed it at him from the proper distance, and squeezed the bulb. He shut his eyes and tightened his lips to a thin line.
"Now the other side," I said gently. "What's worth doing - "
But he opened his eyes, and their expression was enough. I put the sprayer on a table and went to a chair.
He looked at his wristwatch. "I read the report of your talk with Rackham. How did it go?"

"You could tell Mr. Haskins - "
"No."
He gave up. After sitting a while with his eyes closed, he sighed so deep it
made him shudder, and then came back to black reality. Only a quarter of his hour was left, and we used it to review the situation and program. The strategy was unchanged. At midnight he arose.
"Please thank Miss Rowan for me?"
==> "Sure. She thinks you ought to call her Lily." <==
"You shouldn't leave on my heels."
'I won't. She's sore and wants to have a scene."
I went ahead to open the door for him. As I did so he asked, "What is this
stuff called?"
"Houri de Perse."

We have found three snails in the warm room. I thought of mailing them to Mr. Hewkt but didn't.
Mr. Leeds hanged himself in the jail at White Plains yesterday and was dead when discovered. That of course cancels your promise to Mr. Archer to return in time for the trial, but I trust you will not use it as an excuse to prolong your stay.
We have received your letters and they were most welcome. I have received an offer of $315 for the furniture in your office but am insisting on $350. Fritz says he has written you. I am beginning to feel more like myself.
My best regards,

==> I let Lily read it. "Darn him anyhow," she said. "No message, not a mention of me. My Pete! Huh. Fickle Fatty." <==
"You'd be the last," I told her. "that he'd ever send a message to. You're the only woman that ever got close enough to him, at least in my time, to make him smell of perfume."

"Archie," he snapped. "If after all your promiscuous philandering you can't produce a woman to those specifications, I've misjudged you. It's risky to trust anyone at all, but any other way would be still riskier."
I had my lips puckered. "Ruth Brady?"
"No. She's an operative, and known. Out of the question."
"There's one who might take this as a substitute for a trip to Norway,
which is now out. I could ask her." "What's her name?"
==> "You know. Lily Rowan." <==


He made a face. "She is rich, intemperate, and notorious."
"Nuts. She is well-heeled and playful. You remember the time she helped
out with an upstate murderer. I have no further suggestions. Do I phone her?" "Yes."

 security number. I'll be waiting anxiously at your door."
I hung up and told Wolfe, "All set."
Out of his chair, he grunted. "You overdid it a little, perhaps? Nightmare, for instance?"
"Yes, sir," I agreed. "I get too enthusiastic." I glared at him, and he glared back.
XIV
==> SINCE I do not intend to use up paper reporting the five-hour conference I had with Wolfe that night in Lily Rowan's living room, I could just as well go on to Wednesday morning, except for one thing. I have got to tell about their arrival <==
at the door of Lily's penthouse apartment on East 63rd Street.
Wolfe didn't speak and wouldn't look at me. Lily shook hands with me, a
form of greeting we hadn't used for I don't know how long, then unlocked the door, and we entered. When her wrap and Wolfe's hat had been disposed of and we passed to the living room, she tossed her firecracker.
"Archie," she said, "I knew darned well that something would happen some day to make up for all the time I've wasted on you, I just felt it would."
I nodded. "Certainly. You'll show a profit on the night even if you feed us sandwiches, especially since Pete is a light eater. He's on a diet."

"I'll tell you what I'll do," I offered. "I know her quite well. Two things
that could conceivably happen: first, you might go to Zeck tomorrow and tell him who you are, and second. Lily might spill it either thoughtfully or thoughtlessly. I'll bet you ten bucks the first happens as soon as the second."
He growled. "She's a woman."
"All right, bet me."
The bet didn't get made. Not that Wolfe came to my point of view about
==> Lily Rowan, but what could the poor son of a gun do? He couldn't even take to the bushes again and start all over. From that point on, though, up to the end, the strain was ten times worse for him than for me. It cramped his style some all that night, after Lily had gone off to bed and we talked in the living room until long after dawn. At six o'clock he went. Probably it would then have been safe for me to go too, since if they were enough interested in him to have posted a sentry outside the building he would almost certainly leave when Roeder did, but probabilities weren't good enough now, not after the picture Wolfe had given me and the program he had drawn up, so I took a good two-hour nap before leaving <==
for 35th Street and a bath and breakfast.
At ten o'clock I was at 1019, starting at the phone to get hold of Saul and
Orrie and Fred.
I did not like it at all. The way Wolfe was getting set to play it, it looked to
me as if we had one chance in a thousand, and while that may be good enough to go ahead on when what you're after is to nail a guy on a charge, and if you muff

"Do you mean," Saul Panzer asked, "that the purpose is to get on his
nerves?"
"No. Play it straight. I only mean it's not life and death - until further
notice." I pushed my chair back and got up. "And now I wish to prove that being an employer hasn't changed me any. You may continue to call me Archie. You may come with me to Thirty-fifth Street, where we will find a poker deck, and Fritz will make five, and when we have finished I'll lend you carfare home."
For the record, I lost twelve dollars. Saul was the big winner. One hand, I had three nines and - but I'd better get on. Rackham was living at the Churchill, in an air-conditioned suite in the tower. During the first week we compiled quite a biography of him. He never stuck his nose outside before one o'clock, and once not until four. His ports of call included two banks, a law office, nine bars, two clubs, a barber shop, seven other shops and stores, three restaurants, three theaters, two night spots, and miscellaneous. He usually ate lunch with a man or men, and dinner with a woman. Not the same woman; three different ones during the week. As described by my operatives, they were a credit to their sex, to the American way of life, and to the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union.
==> I took on a little of it myself, but mostly I left it to the help. Not that I loafed. There were quite a few hours with Lily Rowan, off and on, both as a substitute for the trip to Norway, indefinitely postponed, and as a check on the soundness of the estimate of her I had given Wolfe. She caused me no qualms. Once when we were dancing she sighed for Pete, and once at her apartment she said she would love to help some more with my work, but when I tactfully made it plain that the detective business was not on our agenda she took it nicely and let it lay. <==
There were other things, including the reports on Rackham to be typed. Late every afternoon Max Christy called at my office to get the report of the day before, and he would sit and read it and ask questions. When he got critical, I would explain patiently that I couldn't very well post a man at the door of Rackham's suite to take pictures of all the comers and goers, and that we were scoring better than eighty per cent on all his hours outside, which was exceptional for New York tailing.
I had the advantage, of course, of having had the situation described to me by their Pete Roeder. They were worried a little about Westchester, but more about the city. Shortly after he had become a millionaire by way of a steak knife, whoever had used it, Rackham had got word to Zeck that he was no longer available for contacts. Brownie Costigan had got to Rackham, thinking to put the

 bee on him, and had been tossed out on his ear. The stink being raised in Washington on gambling and rackets, and the resulting enthusiasm in the office of the New York County District Attorney, had started an epidemic of jitters, and it was quite possible that if one of my typed reports had told of a visit by Rackham to the DA's office, or of one by an assistant DA to Rackham's suite, Rackham would have had a bad accident, like getting run over or falling into the river with lead in him. That was why Wolfe had given me careful and explicit instructions about what I should report and what I shouldn't.
I had no sight or sound of Wolfe. He was to let me know if and when there was something stirring, and I had been told how to reach him if I had to. Meanwhile I had my schedule, and on the ninth day, a Friday, the first of September, it called for a move. Things looked right for it. Saul, on instructions, had let himself get spotted once, and Orrie twice, and Fred, without instructions, at least three times. I too had cooperated by letting myself be seen at the entrance of the Crooked Circle one night as Rackham emerged with companions. So Friday at five o'clock, when Saul phoned that the subject had entered the

"Oh, for God's sake!" I said impatiently. "Have I impressed you as the son

 of boob who would jump off a building just to hear his spine crack? Yes, brother, I know who I'm dealing with, and I expect to live to ninety at least."
He straightened up. "Your chief trouble," he said, not offensively, "is that you think you've got a sense of humor. It confuses people, and you ought to get over it. Things strike you as funny. You thought it would be funny to have a talk with Rackham, and it may be all right this time, but some day something that you think is funny will blow your goddam head right off your shoulders."
Only after he had gone did it occur to me that that wouldn't prove it wasn't funny.
==> I had a date that Saturday evening with Lily Rowan, but decided to call it off. Evidently I wasn't tactful enough about it, for she took on. I calmed her down by promising to drown myself as soon as the present crisis was past, went home and got my dinner out of the refrigerator, and settled down in the office for another evening of not reading magazines. A little after nine the minutes were beginning to get too damn long entirely when the phone rang. It was Lily. <==
"All right," she said briskly, "come on up here."
"I told you - "
"I know, but now I'm telling you. I'm going to have company around
eleven, and as I understand it you're supposed to get here first. Get started." "Phooey. I'm flattered that you bothered to try it, but - "
"I wouldn't have dreamed of trying it. The company just phoned, and I'm

He finally arrived. I must admit that when the bell rang Lily, having promised to behave like a lady, did so. She insisted on opening the door for him, but having got him into the living room, she excused herself and left us.
He sat. I stood and looked at him. Eleven days had passed since our reunion, and I hadn't properly remembered how grotesque he was. Except for the eyes, he was no one I had ever seen or cared to see.
"What's the matter?" I asked peevishly. "You look as if you hadn't slept for a week."
"I'm a little tired, that's all," he growled. "I have too much to watch, and

==>  I'm starving to death. So far as I know everything at my end is satisfactory. What about Miss Rowan?" <==
"She's all right. As you may remember, every week or so I used to send her a couple of orchids of a kind that couldn't be bought. I have told her that the custom may be resumed some day provided we get this difficulty ironed out, and that it depends on her. Women like to have things depend on them."
He grunted. "I don't like to have things depend on them." He sighed.
"It can't be helped. I can only stay an hour. Bring me some of Miss Rowan's perfume."
I went and tapped on a door, got no answer, opened it and crossed a room to another door, tapped again, was told to enter, and did so. Lily was on a divan with a book. I told her what I wanted.
"Take the Houri de Perse," she advised. "Pete likes it. I had it on that night."

"Take the Houri de Perse," she advised. "Pete likes it. I had it on that night."
I got it from the dressing table, returned to the living room, aimed it at him from the proper distance, and squeezed the bulb. He shut his eyes and tightened his lips to a thin line.
"Now the other side," I said gently. "What's worth doing - "
But he opened his eyes, and their expression was enough. I put the sprayer on a table and went to a chair.

"Yes, sir." He had me. "You're right. I beg your pardon. But I am not going to phone Haskins. You just had a moment of weakness. Let's change the subject. Does Rackham's biting on the first try change the schedule any?"
"You could tell Mr. Haskins - "
"No."
He gave up. After sitting a while with his eyes closed, he sighed so deep it
made him shudder, and then came back to black reality. Only a quarter of his hour was left, and we used it to review the situation and program. The strategy was unchanged. At midnight he arose.
==> "Please thank Miss Rowan for me?" <==
"Sure. She thinks you ought to call her Lily."
"You shouldn't leave on my heels."
'I won't. She's sore and wants to have a scene."
I went ahead to open the door for him. As I did so he asked, "What is this
stuff called?"
