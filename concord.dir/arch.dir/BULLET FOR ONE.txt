"Maybe I haven't made it clear," she persisted, twisting her fingers some more though I had asked her to stop. "I'm not making anything up, really I'm not. If they framed me once, isn't that a good enough reason to think they are doing it again?"
If her cheek color had been from a drugstore, with the patches showing because the fear in her heart was using extra blood for internal needs, I would probably have been affected more. But at first sight of her I had been reminded of a picture on a calendar hanging on the wall of Sam's Diner on Eleventh Avenue, a picture of a round-faced girl with one hand holding a pail and the other hand resting on the flank of a cow she had just milked or was going to milk. It was her to a T, in skin tint, build, and innocence.
She quit the finger-twisting to make tight little fists and perch them on her thigh fronts. "Is he really such a puffed-up baboon?" she demanded. "They'll be here in twenty minutes, and I've got to see him first!"
Suddenly she was out of the chair, on her feet. "Where is he, upstairs?"
Having suspected she was subject to impulses, I had, instead of crossing to my desk, held a position between her and the door to the hall.
==> "Give it up," I advised her. "When you stand up you tremble, I noticed that when you came in, so sit down. I've tried to explain, Miss Rooney, that while this room is Mr, Wolfe's office, the rest of this building is his home. From nine to eleven in the morning, and from four to six in the afternoon, he is absolutely at home, up in the plant rooms with his orchids, and bigger men than you have had to like it. But, what I've seen of you, I think possibly you're nice, and I'll do you a favor." <==
"What?"


"Sit down and quit trembling." She sat down.
"I'll go up and tell him about you."

"Sit down and quit trembling." She sat down.
"I'll go up and tell him about you."
"What will you tell him?"
"I'll remind him that a man named Ferdinand Pohl phoned this morning
==> and made a date for himself and four others, to come here to see Mr. Wolfe at six o'clock, which is sixteen minutes from now. I'll tell him your name is Audrey Rooney and you're one of the four others, and you're fairly good-looking and may be nice, and you're scared stiff because, as you tell it, they're pretending they think it was Talbott but actually they're getting set to frame you, and - " <==
"Not all of them."
"Anyhow some. I'll tell him that you came ahead of time to see him alone and inform him that you have not murdered anyone, specifically not Sigmund Keyes, and to warn him that he must watch these stinkers like a hawk."
"It sounds crazy - like that!"
"I'll put feeling in it."
She left her chair again, came to me in three swift steps, flattened her

palms on my coat front, and tilted her head back to get my eyes.
"You may be nice too," she said hopefully.
"That would be too much to expect," I told her as I turned and made for
the stairs in the hall.

==> Sitting there in the office with my chair swiveled so that my back was to my desk, with Wolfe himself behind his desk to my left, I took Pohl in. He was close to twice my age. Seated in the red leather chair beyond the end of Wolfe's desk, with his leg-crossing hoisting his pants so that five inches of bare shin showed above his garterless sock, there was nothing about him to command attention except an unusual assortment of facial creases, and nothing at all to love. <==
"What brought us together," he was saying in a thin peevish tone, "and what brought us here together, is our unanimous opinion that Sigmund Keyes was murdered by Victor Talbott, and also our conviction - "
"Not unanimous," another voice objected.
The voice was soft and good for the ears, and its owner was good for the eyes. Her chin, especially, was the kind you can take from any angle. The only
Ferdinand Pohl was speaking.

"Who do you think killed him if Vic didn't?"
"I don't know." The brows went up again. "But since I have inherited my father's business, and since 1 am engaged to marry Vic, and since a few other things, I want very much to know. That's why I'm here with you."
"You don't belong here!"
"I'm here, Ferdy."
"I say you don't belong!" Pohl's creases were wriggling. "I said so and I
==> still say so! We came, the four of us, for a definite purpose, to get Nero Wolfe to find proof that Vic killed your father!" Pohl suddenly uncrossed his legs, leaned forward to peer at Dorothy Keyes' face, and asked in a mean little voice, "And what if you helped him?" <==
Three other voices spoke at once. One said, "They're off again." Another, "Let Mr. Broadyke tell it."
Another, "Get one of them out of here."
Wolfe said, "If the job is limited to those terms, Mr. Pohl, to prove that a
man named by you committed murder, you've wasted your trip. What if he didn't?"
Many things had happened in that office on the ground floor of the old brownstone house owned by Nero Wolfe during the years I had worked for him as his man Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

This gathering in the office, on this Tuesday evening in October, had its own special angle of interest. Sigmund Keyes, top-drawer industrial designer, had been murdered the preceding Tuesday, just a week ago. I had read about it in the papers and had also found an opportunity to hear it privately discussed by my

 friend and enemy Sergeant Purley Stebbins of Homicide, and from the professional-detective slant it struck me as a lulu.

I had read about it in the papers and had also found an opportunity to hear it privately discussed by my

 friend and enemy Sergeant Purley Stebbins of Homicide, and from the professional-detective slant it struck me as a lulu.
It had been Keyes' custom, five days a week at six-thirty in the morning, to take a walk in the park, and to do it the hard and silly way by walking on four legs instead of two. He kept the four legs, which he owned and which were named Casanova, at the Stillwell Riding Academy on Ninety-eighth Street just west of the park. That morning he mounted Casanova as usual, promptly at six- thirty, and rode into the park. Forty minutes later, at seven-ten, he had been seen by a mounted cop, in the park on patrol, down around Sixty-sixth Street. His customary schedule would have had him about there at that time. Twenty-five minutes later, at seven-thirty-five, Casanova, with his saddle uninhabited, had emerged from the park uptown and strolled down the street to the academy. Curiosity had naturally been aroused, and in three-quarters of an hour had been satisfied, when a park cop had found Keyes' body behind a thicket some twenty yards from the bridle path in the park, in the latitude of Ninety-fifth Street. Later a .38-caliber revolver bullet had been dug out of his chest. The police had concluded, from marks on the path and beyond its edge, that he had been shot out of his saddle and had crawled, with difficulty, up a little slope toward a paved walk for pedestrians, and hadn't had enough life left to make it.
A horseman shot from his saddle within sight of the Empire State Building was of course a natural for the tabloids, and the other papers thought well of it too. No weapon had been found, and no eyewitnesses. No citizen had even come forward to report seeing a masked man lurking behind a tree, probably because very few New Yorkers could possibly explain being up and dressed and strolling in the park at that hour of the morning.

==> So the city employees had had to start at the other end and look for motives and opportunities. During the week that had passed a lot of names had been mentioned and a lot of people had received official callers, and as a result the glare had pretty well concentrated on six spots. So the papers had it, and so I gathered from Purley Stebbins. What gave the scene in our office that Tuesday afternoon its special angle of interest was the fact that five of the six spots were there seated on chairs, and apparently what they wanted Wolfe to do was to take the glare out of their eyes and get it aimed exclusively at the sixth spot, not present. <==

'Permit me to say," Frank Broadyke offered in a cultivated baritone, "that Mr. Pohl has put it badly. The situation is this, Mr. Wolfe, that Mr. Pohl got us together and we found that each of us feels that he is being harassed unreasonably. Not only that he is unjustly suspected of a crime he did not commit, but that in a full week the police have accomplished nothing and aren't likely to, and we will be left with this unjust suspicion permanently upon us."
Broadyke gestured with a hand. More than his baritone was cultivated; he was cultivated all over. He was somewhat younger than Pohl, and ten times as elegant. His manner gave the impression that he was finding it difficult just to be himself because (a) he was in the office of a private detective, which was vulgar, (b) he had come there with persons with whom one doesn't ordinarily associate, which was embarrassing, and (c) the subject for discussion was his connection with a murder, which was preposterous. He was going on. "Mr. Pohl suggested that we consult you and engage your services. As one who will gladly pay my share of the bill, permit me to say that what I want is the removal of that unjust suspicion. If you can achieve that only by finding the criminal and evidence against him, very well. If the guilty man proves to be Victor Talbott, again very well."
"There's no if about it!" Pohl blurted. "Talbott did it, and the job is to pin it on him!"

"There's no if about it!" Pohl blurted. "Talbott did it, and the job is to pin it on him!"
"With me helping, Ferdy, don't forget," Dorothy Keyes told him softly. "Aw, can it!"
Eyes turned to the speaker, whose only contribution up to that point had been the remark, "They're off again." Heads had to turn too because he was seated to the rear of the swing of the arc. The high pitch of his voice was a good match for his name, Wayne Safford, but not for his broad husky build and the strong big bones of his face. According to the papers he was twenty-eight, but he looked a little older, about my age.
Wolfe nodded at him. "I quite agree, Mr. Safford." Wolfe's eyes swept the arc. "Mr. Pohl wants too much for his money. You can hire me to catch a fish, ladies and gentlemen, but you can't tell me which fish. You can tell me what it is I'm after - a murderer - but you can't tell me who it is unless you have evidence, and in that case why pay me? Have you got evidence?"

moved, left and right and left again, and settled on Audrey Rooney, whose chair was a little in the rear, to one side of Wayne Safford's. "Miss Rooney," he shot at her, "you seem to be the most vulnerable, since you were on the scene. When did Mr. Keyes dismiss you from his employ, and what for?"

Audrey had been sitting straight and still, with her lips tight. "Well, it was - " she began, but stopped to clear her throat and then didn't continue because of an interruption.
The doorbell had rung, and I had left it to Fritz to answer it, which was the custom when I was engaged with Wolfe and visitors, unless superseding orders had been given. Now the door to the hall opened, and Fritz entered, closed the door behind him, and announced. "A gentleman to see you, sir. Mr. Victor Talbott."

"I'll have to phone," Broadyke muttered.
"You may," Wolfe conceded, as if he were yielding a point. His eyes
moved, left and right and left again, and settled on Audrey Rooney, whose chair was a little in the rear, to one side of Wayne Safford's. "Miss Rooney," he shot at her, "you seem to be the most vulnerable, since you were on the scene. When did Mr. Keyes dismiss you from his employ, and what for?"
Audrey had been sitting straight and still, with her lips tight. "Well, it was - " she began, but stopped to clear her throat and then didn't continue because of an interruption.

"How the devil - " Frank Broadyke started, and stopped.
"So you told him!" Pohl spat at Dorothy Keyes.
Dorothy merely raised her brows. I was getting fed up with that routine and wished she would try something else.
Audrey Rooney's mouth was hanging open. "Show him in," Wolfe told Fritz.

Like millions of my fellow citizens, I had done some sizing up of Victor Talbott from pictures of him in the papers, and within ten seconds after he had joined us in the office I had decided the label I had tied on him could stay. He was the guy who, at a cocktail party or before dinner, grabs the tray of appetizers and passes it around, looking into eyes and making cracks. Not counting me, he was easily the best-looking male in the room.
Entering, he shot a glance and a smile at Dorothy Keyes, ignored the others, came to a stop in front of Wolfe's desk, and said pleasantly, "You're Nero Wolfe, of course. I'm Vic Talbott. I suppose you'd rather not shake hands with me under the circumstances - that is, if you're accepting the job these people came to offer you. Are you?"
"How do you do, sir," Wolfe rumbled. "Good heavens, I've shaken hands

"Nuts," Wayne Safford squeaked at him. "You come prancing in, huh?"
==> Ferdinand Pohl had left his chair and was advancing on the gatecrasher. I was on my feet, ready to move. There was plenty of feeling loose in the room, and I didn't want any of our clients hurt. But all Pohl did was to tap Talbott on the chest with a thick forefinger and growl at him, "Listen, my boy. You're not going to sell anything here. You've made one sale too many as it is." Pohl whirled to Wolfe. "What did you let him in for?" <==
"Permit me to say," Broadyke put in, "that it does seem an excess of hospitality."
"By the way, Vic" - it was Dorothy's soft voice - "Ferdy says I was your accomplice."
The remarks from the others had made no visible impression on him, but it was different with Dorothy. He turned to her, and the look on his face was good for a whole chapter in his biography. He was absolutely all hers unless I needed an oculist. She could lift her lovely brows a thousand times a day without feeding him up. He let his eyes speak to her and then wheeled to use his tongue for Pohl. "Do you know what I think of you, Ferdy? I guess you do!"
"If you please," Wolfe said sharply. "You don't need my office for exchanging your opinions of one another; you can do that anywhere. We have work to do. Mr. Talbott, you asked if I've accepted a job that has been offered me. I have. I have engaged to investigate the murder of Sigmund Keyes. But I have received no confidences and can still decline it. Have you a better offer? What did you come here for?"
Talbott smiled at him. "That's the way to talk," he said admiringly. "No, I have nothing to offer in the way of a job, but I felt I ought to be in on this. I figured it this way: they were going to hire you to get me arrested for murder, so naturally you would like to have a look at me and ask me some questions - and here I am."

"Pleading not guilty, of course. Archie. A chair for Mr. Talbott."
"Of course," he agreed, thanking me with a smile for the chair I brought, and sitting down. "Otherwise you'd have no job. Shoot." Suddenly he flushed. "Under the circumstances, I guess I shouldn't have said shoot.'"
"You could have said 'Fire away,' " Wayne Safford piped up from the rear. "Be quiet, Wayne," Audrey Rooney scolded him.

"No. Mr. Talbott has invited questions." He focused on the inviter. "These
other people think the police are handling this matter stupidly and ineffectively. Do you agree, Mr. Talbott?"
Vic considered a moment, then nodded. "On the whole, yes," he assented. "Why?"
"Well - you see, they're up against it. They're used to working with clues,
and while they found plenty of clues to show what happened, like the marks on the bridle path and leading to the thicket, there aren't any that help to identify the murderer. Absolutely none whatever. So they had to fall back on motive, and right away they found a man with the best motive in the world."

And he didn't gallop, because if he had the horse would have shown it, and he didn't." Talbott twisted around. "You're the authority on that, Wayne. Casanova hadn't been in a sweat, had he?"

"You're telling it," was all he got from Wayne Safford.
==> "Well, he hadn't," Talbott told Wolfe. "Wayne is on record on that. So Keyes couldn't have reached the spot where he was killed before seven-twenty- five. There's the time for that, twenty-five minutes past seven." <==
"And you?" Wolfe inquired.
"Me, I was lucky. I often rode in the park with Keyes at that ungodly hour - two or three times a week. He wanted me to make it every day, but I got out of it about half the time. There was nothing social or sociable about it. We would walk our horses side by side, talking business, except when he felt like trotting. I live at the Hotel Churchill. I got in late Monday night, but I left a call for six o'clock anyway, because I hadn't ridden with Keyes for several days and didn't want to get him sore. But when the girl rang my phone in the morning I was just too damn sleepy, and I told her to call the riding academy and say I wouldn't be there, and to call me again at seven-thirty. She did so, and I still didn't feel like turning out but I had to because I had a breakfast date with an out-of-town customer, so I told her to send up a double orange juice. A few minutes later a waiter brought it up. So was I lucky? Keyes was killed uptown at twenty-five past seven at the earliest, and probably a little later. I was in my room at the Churchill, nearly three miles away, at half-past seven. You can have three guesses how glad I was I left that seven-thirty call!"
Wolfe nodded. "You should give the out-of-town customer a discount. In that armor, why did you take the trouble to join this gathering?"
"A switchboard girl and a waiter, for God's sake!"

Talbott compressed his lips and loosened them. "Oh, boy! The mounted cop saw Keyes riding in the park near Sixty-sixth Street at ten minutes past

 seven. Keyes was killed near Ninety-sixth Street. Even if he had galloped all the way he couldn't have got there, the way that bridle path winds, before seven- twenty. And he didn't gallop, because if he had the horse would have shown it, and he didn't." Talbott twisted around. "You're the authority on that, Wayne. Casanova hadn't been in a sweat, had he?"
"You're telling it," was all he got from Wayne Safford.
"Well, he hadn't," Talbott told Wolfe. "Wayne is on record on that. So Keyes couldn't have reached the spot where he was killed before seven-twenty- five. There's the time for that, twenty-five minutes past seven."
==> "And you?" Wolfe inquired. <==
"Me, I was lucky. I often rode in the park with Keyes at that ungodly hour - two or three times a week. He wanted me to make it every day, but I got out of it about half the time. There was nothing social or sociable about it. We would walk our horses side by side, talking business, except when he felt like trotting. I live at the Hotel Churchill. I got in late Monday night, but I left a call for six o'clock anyway, because I hadn't ridden with Keyes for several days and didn't want to get him sore. But when the girl rang my phone in the morning I was just too damn sleepy, and I told her to call the riding academy and say I wouldn't be there, and to call me again at seven-thirty. She did so, and I still didn't feel like turning out but I had to because I had a breakfast date with an out-of-town customer, so I told her to send up a double orange juice. A few minutes later a waiter brought it up. So was I lucky? Keyes was killed uptown at twenty-five past seven at the earliest, and probably a little later. I was in my room at the Churchill, nearly three miles away, at half-past seven. You can have three guesses how glad I was I left that seven-thirty call!"
Wolfe nodded. "You should give the out-of-town customer a discount. In that armor, why did you take the trouble to join this gathering?"
"A switchboard girl and a waiter, for God's sake!"
Pohl snorted sarcastically.
"Nice honest people, Ferdy," Talbott told him, and answered Wolfe, "I

The doorbell rang again, and since additional gatecrashers might or might not be desirable, I upped myself in a hurry, stepped across and into the hall, intercepted Fritz just in time, and went to the front door to take a look through the panel of one-way glass.

"You will not. You never have and you never will."

I shut the door, went to the office, and told Wolfe, "The man about the chair," which was my favorite alias for Inspector Cramer of Homicide.
Wolfe grunted and shook his head. "I'll be busy for hours and can't be interrupted."
I returned to the front, opened to the crack again, and said regretfully, "Sorry, but he's doing his homework."

Audrey Rooney was standing in the corner by the big globe, with her clenched fists pressed against her cheeks, staring. Pohl and Broadyke were also out of their chairs, also gazing at the center of the room. From the spectators' frozen attitudes you might have expected to see something really startling, but it was only a couple of guys slinging punches. As I entered Talbott landed a right hook on the side of Safford's neck, and as I closed the door to the hall behind me Safford countered with a solid stiff left to Talbott's kidney sector. The only noise besides their fists and feet was a tense mutter from Audrey Rooney in her corner. "Hit him, Wayne; hit him, Wayne."
"How much did I miss?" I demanded.
"Stop them!" Wolfe ordered me. Talbott's right glanced off of Safford's cheek, and Safford got in another one over the kidney. They were operating properly and in an orderly manner, but Wolfe was the boss and he hated commotion in the office, so I stepped across, grabbed Talbott's coat collar and yanked him back so hard he fell over a chair, and faced Safford to block him. For a second I thought Safford was going to paste me with one he had waiting, but he let it drop.
"What started it so quick?" I wanted to know.
Audrey was there, clutching my sleeve, protesting fiercely, "You shouldn't have stopped him! Wayne could have knocked him down! He did before!" She sounded more bloodthirsty than milkthirsty.

"Vic is going now," I told her. "Come on, Talbott, I'll let you out."
Before he came he enfolded Dorothy in his arms. I glanced at Safford, expecting him to counter by enfolding Audrey, but he was standing by with his

At 10:55 the next morning I was sitting in the office - not still, but again - waiting for Wolfe to come down from the plant rooms on the roof, where he keeps ten thousand orchids and an assortment of other specimens of vegetation. I was playing three-handed pinochle with Saul Panzer and Orrie Cather, who had been phoned to come in for a job. Saul always wore an old brown cap, was undersized and homely, with a big nose, and was the best field man in the world for everything that could be done without a dinner jacket. Orrie, who would be able to get along without a hairbrush in a few years, was by no means up to Saul but was a good all-round man.
At 10:55 I was three bucks down.
In a drawer of my desk were two notebookfuls.
Wolfe hadn't kept the clients all night, but there hadn't been much left of it

At 10:55 I was three bucks down.
In a drawer of my desk were two notebookfuls.
Wolfe hadn't kept the clients all night, but there hadn't been much left of it
when he let them go, and we now knew a good deal more about all of them than any of the papers had printed. In some respects they were all alike, as they told it. For instance, none of them had killed Sigmund Keyes; none was heartbroken over his death, not even his daughter; none had ever owned a revolver or knew much about shooting one; none could produce any evidence that would help to convict Talbott or even get him arrested; none had an airtight alibi; and each had a motive of his own which might not have been the best in the world, like Talbott's, but was nothing to sneeze at. So they said.
Ferdinand Pohl had been indignant. He couldn't see why time should be wasted on them and theirs, since the proper and sole objective was to bust Talbott's alibi and nab him. But he came through with his facts. Ten years previously he had furnished the hundred thousand dollars that had been needed

Back in the office someone had righted the overturned chair, and they were all seated again. Apparently, though her knight had been given the boot, Dorothy was going to stick. As I crossed to resume my place at my desk Wolfe was saying, "We got interrupted, Miss Rooney. As I said, you seem to be the most vulnerable, since you were on the scene. Will you please move a little closer - that chair there? Archie, your notebook."
VI
At 10:55 the next morning I was sitting in the office - not still, but again - waiting for Wolfe to come down from the plant rooms on the roof, where he keeps ten thousand orchids and an assortment of other specimens of vegetation. I was playing three-handed pinochle with Saul Panzer and Orrie Cather, who had been phoned to come in for a job. Saul always wore an old brown cap, was undersized and homely, with a big nose, and was the best field man in the world for everything that could be done without a dinner jacket. Orrie, who would be able to get along without a hairbrush in a few years, was by no means up to Saul but was a good all-round man.
At 10:55 I was three bucks down.
In a drawer of my desk were two notebookfuls.
==> Wolfe hadn't kept the clients all night, but there hadn't been much left of it <==
when he let them go, and we now knew a good deal more about all of them than any of the papers had printed. In some respects they were all alike, as they told it. For instance, none of them had killed Sigmund Keyes; none was heartbroken over his death, not even his daughter; none had ever owned a revolver or knew much about shooting one; none could produce any evidence that would help to convict Talbott or even get him arrested; none had an airtight alibi; and each had a motive of his own which might not have been the best in the world, like Talbott's, but was nothing to sneeze at. So they said.
Ferdinand Pohl had been indignant. He couldn't see why time should be wasted on them and theirs, since the proper and sole objective was to bust Talbott's alibi and nab him. But he came through with his facts. Ten years previously he had furnished the hundred thousand dollars that had been needed

 to get Sigmund Keyes started with the style of setup suitable for a big-time industrial designer. In the past couple of years the Keyes profits had been up above the clouds, and Pohl had wanted an even split and hadn't got it. Keyes had ladled out a measly annual five per cent on Pohl's ante, five thousand a year, whereas half the profits would have been ten times that, and Pohl couldn't confront him with the classic alternative, buy my share or sell me yours, because Pohl had been making bad guesses on other matters and was deep in debt. The law wouldn't have helped, since the partnership agreement had guaranteed Pohl only the five per cent and Keyes had given the profits an alias by taking the gravy as salary, claiming it was his designing ability that made the money. It had been, Pohl said, a case of misjudging a man's character. Now that Keyes was dead it would be a different story, with the contracts on hand and royalties to come for periods up to twenty years. If Pohl and Dorothy, who inherited, couldn't come to an understanding, it would be up to a judge to make the divvy, and Pohl would get, he thought, at least two hundred thousand, and probably a lot more.
He denied that that was a good motive for murder - not for him, and anyway it was silly to discuss it, because that Tuesday morning at 7:28 he had taken a train to Larchmont to sail his boat. Had he boarded the train at Grand Central or One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street? Grand Central, he said. Had he been alone? Yes. He had left his apartment on East Eighty-fourth Street at seven o'clock and taken the subway.

He had left his apartment on East Eighty-fourth Street at seven o'clock and taken the subway.
Did he often ride the subway? Yes, fairly frequently, when it wasn't a rush hour. And so on, for fourteen pages of a notebook. I gave him a D minus, even granting that he could cinch it that he reached Larchmont on that train, since it would have stopped at One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street at 7:38, ten minutes after it left Grand Central.
With Dorothy Keyes the big question was how much of the Keyes profits had been coming her way. Part of the time she seemed to have the idea that her father had been fairly liberal with the dough, and then she would toss in a comment which indicated that he had been as tight-fisted as a baby hanging onto another baby's toy. It was confusing because she had no head for figures. The conclusion I reached was that her take had averaged somewhere between five hundred and twenty thousand a year, which was a wide gap. The point was, which way was she sitting prettier, with her father alive and making plenty of dough and shelling it out, or with him dead and everything hers after Pohl had been attended to? She saw the point all right, and I must say it didn't seem to shock her much, since she didn't even bother to lift her brows.
If it was an act it was good. Instead of standing on the broad moral

==>  principle that daughters do not kill fathers, her fundamental position was that at the unspeakable hour in question, half-past seven in the morning, she couldn't even have been killing a fly, let alone her father. She was never out of bed before eleven, except in emergencies, as for instance the Tuesday morning under discussion, when word had come sometime between nine and ten that her father was dead. That had roused her. She had lived with her father in an apartment on Central Park South. Servants? Two maids. Wolfe put it to her: would it have been possible, before seven in the morning, for her to leave the apartment and the building, and later get back in again, without being seen? Not, she declared, unless someone had turned a hose on her to wake her up; that accomplished, possibly the rest could be managed, but she really couldn't say because he had never tried. <==
I gave her no mark at all because by that time I was prejudiced and couldn't trust my judgment.
Frank Broadyke was a wow. He had enthusiastically adopted Talbott's suggestion that if he, Broadyke, had undertaken to kill anyone it would have been Talbott and not Keyes, since it implied that Keyes' eminence in his profession had been on account of Talbott's salesmanship instead of Keyes' ability as a designer. Broadyke liked that very much and kept going back to it and plugging it. He admitted that the steady decrease in his own volume of business had been coincident with the rise of Keyes', and he further admitted, when the matter was mentioned by Dorothy, that only three days before the murder Keyes had started an action at law against him for damages to the tune of a hundred thousand dollars, complaining that Broadyke had stolen designs from Keyes' office which had got him contracts for a concrete mixer and an electric washing machine. But what the hell, he maintained, the man he would naturally have it in for was Vic Talbott, who had stampeded the market with his high- pressure sales methods - and his personality. Ask any reputable industrial designer; ask all of them. Keyes had been a mediocre gadget contriver, with no real understanding of the intricate and intimate relationship between function and design. I see from my notebook that he permitted himself to say that four times altogether.
He had been doing his best to recover lost ground. He partook, he said, of the nature of the lark; the sunrise stirred and inspired him; that was his time of day. All his brilliant early successes had been conceived before the dew was dry in shady places. In the afternoon and evening he was no better than a clod. But eventually he had got lazy and careless, stayed up late and got up late, and it was then his star had begun to dim. Recently, quite recently, he had determined to light the flame again, and only a month ago he had started getting to his office

 before seven o'clock, three hours before the staff was due to arrive. To his satisfaction and delight, it was beginning to work. The flashes of inspiration were coming back. That very Tuesday morning, the morning Keyes was killed, he had greeted his staff when they arrived by showing them a revolutionary and irresistible design for an electric egg beater.

==> Had anyone, Wolfe wanted to know, been with him in his office that morning during the parturition, say from half-past six to eight o'clock? No. No one. <==
For alibi, Broadyke, of those three, came closest to being naked.
Since I had cottoned to Audrey Rooney and would have married her any second if it wasn't that I wouldn't want my wife to be a public figure and there was her picture on the calendar on the wall of Sam's Diner, it was a setback to learn that her parents in Vermont had actually named her Annie, and she had changed it herself. Okay if she hadn't cared for Annie with Rooney, but good God, why Audrey? Audrey. It showed a lack in her.
It did not, of course, indict her for murder, but her tale helped out on that. She had worked in the Keyes office as Victor Talbott's secretary, and a month ago Keyes had fired her because he suspected her of swiping designs and selling them to Broadyke. When she had demanded proof and Keyes hadn't been able to produce it, she had proceeded to raise hell, which I could well believe. She had forced her way into his private room at the office so often that he had been compelled to hire a husky to keep her out. She had tried to get the rest of the staff, forty of them, to walk out on him until justice had been done her, and had darned near succeeded. She had tried to get at him at his home but failed. Eight days before his death, on a Monday morning, he had found her waiting for him when he arrived at the Stillwell Riding Academy to get his four legs. With the help of the stable hand, by name Wayne Safford, he had managed to mount and clatter off for the park.
But next morning Annie Audrey was there again, and the next one too. What was biting her hardest, as she explained to Wolfe at the outset, was that Keyes had refused to listen to her, had never heard her side, and was so mean and stubborn he didn't intend to. She thought he should. She didn't say in so many words that another reason she kept on showing up at the academy was that the stable hand didn't seem to mind, but that could be gathered. The fourth morning, Thursday, Vic Talbott had arrived too, to accompany Keyes on his ride. Keyes, pestered by Audrey, had poked her in the belly with his crop; Wayne Safford had pushed Keyes hard enough to make him stumble and fall; Talbott had intervened and taken a swing at Wayne; and Wayne had socked Talbott and knocked him into a stall that hadn't been cleaned.

Evidently, I thought, Wayne held back when he was boxing in a nicely
furnished office on a Kerman rug; and I also thought that if I had been Keyes I would have tried designing an electric horse for my personal use. But the next day he was back for more, and did get more comments from Audrey, but that was as far as it went; and three days later, Monday, it was the same. Talbott wasn't there either of those two days.
Tuesday morning Audrey got there at a quarter to six, the advantage of the early arrival being that she could make the coffee while Wayne curried horses. They ate cinnamon rolls with the coffee. Wolfe frowned at that because he hates cinnamon rolls. A little after six a phone call came from the Hotel Churchill not to saddle Talbott's horse and to tell Keyes he wouldn't be there. At six-thirty Keyes arrived, on the dot as usual, responded only with grimly tightened lips to Audrey's needling, and rode off. Audrey stayed on at the academy, was there continuously for another hour, and was still there at twenty-five minutes to eight, when Keyes' horse came wandering in under an empty saddle.

Was Wayne Safford also there continuously? Yes, they were together all the time.
So Audrey and Wayne were fixed up swell. When it came Wayne's turn he didn't contradict her on a single point, which I thought was very civilized behavior for a stable hand. He too made the mistake of mentioning cinnamon rolls, but otherwise turned in a perfect score.
When they had gone, more than two hours after midnight, I stood, stretched and yawned good, and told Wolfe, "Five mighty fine clients. Huh?"
He grunted in disgust and put his hands on the rim of his desk to push his chair back.
"I could sleep on it more productively," I stated, "if you would point. Not at Talbott, I don't need that. I'm a better judge of love looks than you are, and I saw him looking at Dorothy, and he has it bad. But the clients? Pohl?"

"Okay, that'll do. How about her?"
"A woman either being wronged or caught wronging another. In either
case, unhinged."

"No." We were in the hall. Wolfe, heading for the elevator to ascend to his room on the second floor, turned. "What did he want?"

I had told them the Keyes case had knocked on our door and we had five suspects for clients, and that was all. Wolfe had not seen fit to tell me what their errands would be, so I was entertaining at cards instead of summarizing the notebooks for them. At eleven sharp we ended the game, and Orrie and I shelled out to Saul, as usual, and a few minutes later the door from the hail opened and Wolfe entered. He greeted the two hired hands, got himself installed behind his desk, rang for beer, and asked me, "You've explained things to Saul and Orrie, of course?"
"Certainly not. For all I knew it's classified." He grunted and told me to get Inspector Cramer. I dialed the number and had more trouble getting through than usual, finally had Cramer and signaled to Wolfe, and, since I got no sign to
"Forty trump," Orrie Cather said at 10:55 Wednesday morning.

==> an usual, finally had Cramer and signaled to Wolfe, and, since I got no sign to keep off, I stayed on. It wasn't much of a conversation. "Mr. Cramer? Nero Wolfe." <==
"Yeah. What do you want?"
"I'm sorry I was busy last evening. It's always a pleasure to see you. I've been engaged in the matter of Mr. Keyes' death, and it will be to our mutual interest for you to let me have a little routine information."
"Like what?"
"To begin with, the name and number of the mounted policeman who saw Mr. Keyes in the park at ten minutes past seven that morning. I want to send Archie - "
"Go to hell." The connection went.

==> Wolfe hung up, reached for the beer tray which Fritz had brought in, and told me, "Get Mr. Skinner of the District Attorney's office." <==
I did so, and Wolfe got on again. In the past Skinner had had his share of moments of irritation with Wolfe, but at least he hadn't had the door slammed in his face the preceding evening and therefore was not boorish. When he learned that Wolfe was on the Keyes case he wanted to know plenty, but Wolfe stiff- armed him without being too rude and soon had what he was after. Upon Wolfe's assurance that he would keep Skinner posted on developments at his end, which they both knew was a barefaced lie, the Assistant D.A. even offered to ask headquarters to arrange for me to see the cop. And did so. In less than ten minutes after Wolfe and he were finished, a call came from Centre Street to tell me that Officer Hefferan would meet me at 11:45 at the corner of Sixty-sixth Street and Central Park West.
During the less than ten minutes, Wolfe had drunk beer, asked Saul about his family, and told me what I was expected to find out from the cop. That made me sore, but even more it made me curious. When we're on a case it sometimes happens that Wolfe gets the notion that I have got involved on some angle or with some member of the cast, and that therefore it is necessary to switch me temporarily onto a siding. I had about given up wasting nervous energy resenting it. But what was it this time? I had bought nobody's version and was absolutely fancy free, so why should he send me out to chew the rag with a cop and keep Saul and Orrie for more important errands? It was beyond me, and I was glaring at him and about to open up, when the phone rang again.
It was Ferdinand Pohl, asking for Wolfe. I was going to keep out of it, since the main attack was to be entrusted to others, but Wolfe motioned me to stay on.
"I'm at the Keyes office," Pohl said, "Forty-seventh and Madison. Can you come up here right away?"

This clinches it that it was Talbott who killed Keyes. Of us five, the only ones that could possibly be suspected were Miss Rooney and that stable hand, with that mutual alibi they had, and this clears her - and him too, of course."
"Nonsense. It does nothing of the sort. It proves that she was unjustly accused of theft, and an unjust accusation rankles more than a just one. Now you can have Mr. Talbott charged with larceny, at least. I'm extremely busy. Thank you very much for calling. I shall need the cooperation of all of you."
Pohl wanted to prolong it, but Wolfe got rid of him, drank more beer, and turned to me. "You're expected there in twenty minutes, Archie, and considering your tendency to get arrested for speeding - "
I had had one ticket for speeding in eight years. I walked to the door but turned to remark bitterly, "If you think you're just sending me out to play, try again. Who was the last to see Keyes alive? The cop. He did it. And who will I deliver him to - you? No. Inspector Cramer!"

It was sunny and warm for October, and the drive uptown would have been pleasant if I hadn't been prejudiced by my feeling that I was being imposed on. Parking on Sixty-fifth Street, I walked around the corner and up a block, and crossed Central Park West to where a man in uniform was monkeying with his horse's bridle. I have met a pack of guardians of the peace on my rounds, but this rugged manly face with a pushed-in nose and bright big eyes was new to me. I introduced myself and showed credentials and said it was nice of him, busy as he was, to give me his time. Of course that was a blunder, but I've admitted I was prejudiced.
"Oh," he said, "one of our prominent kidders, huh?"
I made for cover. "About as prominent," I declared, "as a fish egg in a bowl of caviar."

"Oh," he said, "one of our prominent kidders, huh?"
I made for cover. "About as prominent," I declared, "as a fish egg in a bowl of caviar."
"Oh, you eat caviar."
"Goddam it," I muttered, "let's start over again." I walked four paces to a lamp post, wheeled, returned to him, and announced, "My name's Goodwin and I

==>  work for Nero Wolfe. Headquarters said I could ask you a couple of questions and I'd appreciate it." <==
"Uh-huh. A friend of mine in the Fifteenth Squad has told me about you. You damn near got him sent to the marshes."
"Then you were already prejudiced. So was I, but not against you. Not even against your horse. Speaking of horses, that morning you saw Keyes on his horse, not long before he was killed, what time was it?"
"Ten minutes past seven."
"Within a minute or two?"
"Not within anything. Ten minutes past seven. I was on the early shift

The mounted man's tone indicated that he had decided to humor me and get it over. "I've been through all this with the Homicide boys. If you're asking was it Keyes, it was. It was his horse. It was his bright yellow breeches, the only ones that color around, and his blue jacket and his black derby. It was the way he sat, with his shoulders hunched and his stirrups too long. It was Keyes."
"Good. May I pat your horse?"
"No."
"Then I won't. It would suit me fine if the occasion arose someday for me
to pat you. When I'm dining with the inspector this evening I'll put in a word for you, not saying what kind."
==> I hoofed it out of the park and along Sixty-sixth Street to Broadway, found a drugstore and a phone booth, wriggled onto the stool, and dialed my favorite number. It was Orrie Gather's voice that answered. So, I remarked to myself, he's still there, probably sitting at my desk; Wolfe's instructions for him must be awful complicated. I asked for Wolfe and got him. <==
"Yes, Archie?"
"I am phoning as instructed. Officer Hefferan is a Goodwin-hater, but I

 swallowed my pride. On the stand he would swear up and down that he saw Keyes at the place and time as given, and I guess he did, but a good lawyer could shoot it full of ifs and buts."
"Why? Is Mr. Hefferan a shuttlecock?"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 354    window = 349 359

 swallowed my pride. On the stand he would swear up and down that he saw Keyes at the place and time as given, and I guess he did, but a good lawyer could shoot it full of ifs and buts."
"Why? Is Mr. Hefferan a shuttlecock?"
"By no means. He knows it all. But it wasn't a closeup."
"You'd better let me have it verbatim." I did so. By years of practice I had
reached the point where I could relay a two-hour conversation, without any notes but practically word for word, and the brief session I had just come from gave me no trouble at all.
==> When I had finished Wolfe said, "Indeed." Silence. <==
I waited a full two minutes and then said politely, "Please tell Orrie not to put his feet on my desk."
In another minute Wolfe's voice came. "Mr. Pohl has telephoned again, twice, from the Keyes office. He's a jackass. Go there and see him. The address - "
"I know the address. What part of him do I look at?" "Tell him to stop telephoning me. I want it stopped." "Right. I'll cut the wires. Then what do I do?" "Phone in again and we'll see."
It clicked off. I wriggled off the stool and out of the booth and stood muttering to myself until I noticed that the line of girls on stools at the soda fountain, especially one of them with blue eyes and dimples, was rudely staring at me. I told her distinctly, "Meet me at Tiffany's ring counter at two o'clock," and strode out. Since I wouldn't be able to park within a mile of Forty-seventh and Madison, I decided to leave my car where it was and snare a taxi.

One quick look around the Keyes establishment on the twelfth floor was enough to show where a good slice of the profits had gone, unless that was what Pohl's hundred grand had been used for. Panels of four kinds of blond wood made up both the walls and ceiling, and the furniture matched. The seats of the chairs for waiting callers were upholstered in blue and black super-burlap, and you had to watch yourself on the rugs not to twist an ankle. Everywhere, in glass cases against the walls, on pedestals scattered around, and on platforms and tables, were models of almost anything you could think of, from fountain pens to airplanes.
When a woman with pink earrings learned that I sought Mr. Pohl she gave

When a woman with pink earrings learned that I sought Mr. Pohl she gave

 me a wary and reproachful look, but she functioned. After a little delay I was waved through a door and found myself at the end of a long wide corridor. There was no one in sight and I had been given no directions, so it was a case of hide and seek. The best opening move seemed to be to walk down the corridor, so I started, glancing into open doors on either side as I passed. The same scale of interior architecture seemed to prevail throughout, with wide variations in style and color. At the fourth door on the right I saw him, and he called to me, simultaneously.
"Come in, Goodwin!"
I entered. It was a big room with three wide windows, and at a quick glance appeared to be the spot where they had really decided to spread themselves. The rugs were white and the walls were black, and the enormous desk that took all of one end was either ebony or call in an expert. The chair behind the desk, in which Pohl was seated, was likewise.
==> "Where's Wolfe?" Pohl demanded. <==
"Where he always is," I replied, negotiating rugs. "At home, sitting down." He was scowling at me. "I thought he was with you. When I phoned him a
few minutes ago he intimated that he might be. He's not coming?"
"No. Never. I'm glad you phoned him again because, as he told you this
morning in my hearing, he'll need the cooperation of all of you."
"He'll get mine," Pohl stated grimly. "Since he's not coming for it himself,

It was a single sheet, with "Memo from Sigmund Keyes" on it, printed fancy, and scrawled in ink was a list of towns:

Dayton, Ohio Aug. 11 & 12 Boston Aug. 21
Los Angeles Aug. 27 to Sept. 5 Meadville, Pa. Sept. 15 Pittsburgh Sept. 16 & 17 Chicago Sept. 24-26 Philadelphia Oct. 1
"Much obliged," I thanked him, and stuck it in my pocket. "Covers a lot of country."
==> Pohl nodded. "Talbott gets around, and he's a good salesman, I admit that. Tell Wolfe I did just as he said, and I got it out of a record right here in Keyes' desk, so no one knows anything about it. Those are all the out-of-town trips Talbott has made since August first. I have no idea what Wolfe wants it for, but by God it shows he's on the job, and whoever does know what a detective is after? I don't give a damn how mysterious it is as long as I can help him get Talbott." <==
I had an eye cocked at him, trying to decide whether he was really as naive as he sounded. It gave me one on Wolfe, knowing that he had tried to keep Pohl away from a phone by giving him work to do, and here Pohl had cleaned it up in no time at all and was ready to ask for more. But instead of asking Wolfe for more, he asked me. He shot it at me.
"Go out and get me some sandwiches and coffee. There's a place on Forty- sixth Street, Perrine's."
I sat down. "That's funny, I was about to ask you to get me some. I'm tired and hungry. Let's go together."
"How the hell can I?" he demanded.
"Why not?"

"No, he hasn't been in today."
I glanced at my wrist and saw twenty minutes past one. I stood up. "Rye with mustard?"


"No. White bread and nothing on it - no butter."
==> "Okay. On one condition, that you promise not to phone Mr. Wolfe. If you <==
did you'd be sure to tell him that you got what he's after, and I want to surprise him with it."
He said he wouldn't, and that he wanted two sandwiches and plenty of coffee, and I departed. Two men and a woman who were standing in the corridor, talking, inspected me head to foot as I passed but didn't try to trip me, and I went on out to the elevators, descended, and got directed to a phone booth in the lobby.
Orrie Cather answered again, and I began to suspect that he and Saul were continuing the pinochle game with Wolfe.
"I'm on my way," I told Wolfe when he was on, "to get corned-beef sandwiches for Pohl and me but I've got a plan. He promised not to phone you while I'm gone, and if I don't go back he's stuck. He has installed himself in Keyes' room, which you ought to see, against Dorothy's protests, and intends to stay. Been there all day. What shall I do, come home or go to a movie?"
"Has Mr. Pohl had lunch?"

Two men and a woman who were standing in the corridor, talking, inspected me head to foot as I passed but didn't try to trip me, and I went on out to the elevators, descended, and got directed to a phone booth in the lobby.

"I'm on my way," I told Wolfe when he was on, "to get corned-beef sandwiches for Pohl and me but I've got a plan. He promised not to phone you while I'm gone, and if I don't go back he's stuck. He has installed himself in Keyes' room, which you ought to see, against Dorothy's protests, and intends to stay. Been there all day. What shall I do, come home or go to a movie?"
"Has Mr. Pohl had lunch?"
"Certainly not. That's what the sandwiches are for."
"Then you'll have to take them to him."
I remained calm because I knew he meant it from his heart, or at least his

"Okay. On one condition, that you promise not to phone Mr. Wolfe. If you
did you'd be sure to tell him that you got what he's after, and I want to surprise him with it."

"Oh, you can't wait." I got the paper out and read the list of towns and dates to him. Twice he said I was going too fast, so apparently he was taking it down. When that farce was over I asked, "After I feed him, then what?"
"Call in again when you've had your lunch." I banged the thing on the hook.

They were good sandwiches. The beef was tender and full of hot salty sap, with just the right amount of fat, and the bread had some character. I was a little short on milk, having got only a pint, but stretched it out. In between bites we

I should of course have told Pohl nothing whatever, especially since the more I saw of him the less I liked him, but the sandwiches were so good that I got careless and let it out that as far as I knew no attack had been made on the phone girl and the waiter at the Hotel Churchill. Pohl was determined to phone Wolfe immediately to utter a howl, and in order to stop him I had to tell him that Wolfe had other men on the case and I didn't know who or what they were covering. <==
I was about to phone myself when the door opened and Dorothy Keyes and Victor Talbott walked in. I stood up. Pohl didn't.
"Hello hello," I said cheerfully. "Nice place you have here."
Neither of them even nodded to me. Dorothy dropped into a chair against a wall, crossed her legs, and turned her gaze on Pohl with her chin in the air.
Talbott marched over to us at the ebony desk, stopped at my elbow, and told Pohl, "You know damn well you've got no right here, going through things and trying to order the staff around. You have no right here at all. I'll give you one minute to get out."
"You'll give me?" Pohl sounded nasty and looked nasty. "You're a paid employee, and you won't be that long, and I'm part owner, and you say you'll give me! Trying to order the staff around, am I? I'm giving the staff a chance to tell the truth, and they're doing it. Two of them have spent an hour in a lawyer's office, getting it on paper. A complaint has been sworn against Broadyke for receiving stolen goods, and he's been arrested by now."

I got tired waiting and repeated it. "Mr. Donaldson is here to see you."


"I - " She wet her lips. In a moment she swallowed. In another moment she stood up, said in a voice not soft at all, "Tell her to send him to Mr. Talbott's room," and went.
I forwarded the command as instructed, asked for an outside line, and, when I heard the dial tone, fingered the number. My wrist watch said five past three, and it stopped my tongue for a second when once more I heard Orrie's voice.
==> "Archie," I said shortly. "Let me speak to Saul." "Saul? He's not here. Been gone for hours." "Oh, I thought it was a party. Then Wolfe." Wolfe's voice came. "Yes, Archie?" <==
"I'm in Keyes' office, sitting at his desk. I'm alone. I brought Pohl his lunch, and he owes me ninety-five cents. It just occurred to me that I've seen you go to great lengths to keep your clients from being arrested. Remember the time you buried Clara Fox in a box of osmundine and turned the hose on her? Or the time - "
"What about it?"
"They're scooping up all the clients, that's all. Broadyke has been collared for receiving stolen goods - the designs he bought from Talbott. Pohl has been pulled in for disturbing the peace, and Talbott for assault and battery. Not to mention that Miss Keyes has just had the daylights scared out of her."
"What are you talking about? What happened?"
I told him and, since he had nothing to do but sit and let Orrie answer the phone for him, I left nothing out. When I was through I offered the suggestion that it might be a good plan for me to stick around and find out what it was about Mr. Donaldson that made young women tremble and turn pale at sound of his name.

"I know her address."
"Find her. Get her confidence. Get alone with her. Loosen up her tongue." "What am I after - no, I know what I'm after. What are you after?"

"Shut up." Purley moved a step. His hand started for her elbow, but didn't
reach it, for she drew back and then turned and was on her way. He followed and was at her heels as she went out the door. Apparently she thought she had found a way to get to see her Wayne.
I sat a little while with my lips screwed up, gazing at the ashtray on the desk. I shook my head at nothing in particular, just the state of things, reached for the phone, got an outside line, and dialed again.

"Where's Orrie?" I demanded. "Taking a nap on my bed?" "Where are you?" Wolfe inquired placidly.
"Still in Keyes' office. More of the same. Two more gone." "Two more what? Where?"

"Wayne Safford and Audrey Rooney." I told him what had happened, without bothering to explain that Audrey had walked in before our previous conversation had ended. At the end I added, "So four out of five have been snaffled, and Talbott too. We're in a fine fix. That leaves us with just one, Dorothy Keyes, and it wouldn't surprise me if she was also on her way, judging from the look on her face when she heard who was - Hold it a minute."

What stopped me was the sight of another visitor entering the room. It was Dorothy Keyes. I told the phone, "I'll call back," hung up, and left my chair.
Dorothy came to me. She was still human, more so if anything. The perky lift of her was completely gone, the color scheme of her visible skin was washed-out gray, and her eyes were pinched with trouble.
"Mr. Donaldson gone?" I asked her.
"Yes."

I'll be damned if her brows didn't go up. The humanity I thought I had
seen was only on the surface.

 the office. By the time Dorothy and I had got there she had made it perfectly plain that as far as I was concerned she was all talked out, our conversation during the ride downtown having consisted of her saying at one point, "Look out for that truck," and me replying, "I'm driving," so during the hour's wait I hadn't even asked her if she wanted a drink. And when Wolfe had entered and greeted her, and got his bulk adjusted in his chair behind his desk, the first thing she said was, "I want to speak to you privately." Wolfe shook his head. "Mr. Goodwin is my confidential assistant, and if he didn't hear it from you he soon would from me. What is it?"
"But this is very - personal."
"Most things said in this room by visitors are. What is it?"

Her face was human again, with her eyes pinched. "Did you?" Wolfe asked.

"Forge the check? Yes."
I lifted my brows.
"Tell me about it," Wolfe said.
It came out, and was really quite simple. Her father hadn't given her enough money for the style to which she wanted to accustom herself. A year ago she had forged a check for three thousand dollars, and he had of course discovered it and had received her promise that she would never repeat. Recently she had forged another one, this time for five thousand dollars, and her father had been very difficult about it, but there had been no thought in his head of anything so drastic as having his daughter arrested.
Two days after his discovery of this second offense he had been killed. He had left everything to his daughter, but had made a lawyer named Donaldson executor of the estate, not knowing, according to Dorothy, that Donaldson hated her. And now Donaldson had found the forged check among Keyes' papers, with a memorandum attached to it in Keyes' handwriting, and had called on Dorothy that afternoon to tell her that it was his duty, both as a citizen and as a lawyer, considering the manner of Keyes' death, to give the facts to the police. It was an extremely painful duty, he had asserted, but he would just have to grin and bear it.

"I don't know." It is supposed to make people feel better to tell their troubles, but apparently it made Dorothy feel worse. She sounded as forlorn as she looked.

then I changed my mind. He has strong feelings. It was strong when he loved me, and it is just as strong now when he hates me. Anyway he can use that check to hurt me, he'll do it."
"Then you can't stop him, and neither can I. The forged check and your father's memorandum are legally in his possession, and nothing can keep him from showing them to the police. Does he ride horseback?"

I got up and went to the hall to let her out, to make sure that the door was properly closed behind her. When I was back in the office I sat down and tossed the notebook into a drawer and remarked, "Now she's got us all tagged. I'm a coward, you're a shyster, and the executor of her father's estate is a rat. That poor kid needs some fresh contacts."
==> Wolfe merely grunted, but it was a good-humored grunt, for the dinner hour was near, and he never permits himself to get irritated just before a meal. <==
"So," I said, "unless she does some fancy handling in a hurry she will be gathered in before noon tomorrow, and she was the last we had. All five of them, and also the suspect we were supposed to pin it on. I hope Saul and Orrie are doing better than we are. I have a date for dinner and a show with a friend, but I can break it if there's anything I can be doing - "
"Nothing, thank you."
I glared at him. "Oh, Saul and Orrie are doing it?"

I glared at him. "Oh, Saul and Orrie are doing it?"


"There's nothing for this evening, for you. I'll be here, attending to matters."
Yes, he would. He would be here, reading books, drinking beer, and having Fritz tell anyone who called that he was engaged. It wasn't the first time he had decided that a case wasn't worth the effort and to hell with it. On such occasions my mission was to keep after him until I had him jarred loose, but this time my position was that if Orrie Cather could spend the afternoon in my chair he could damn well do my work. So I let it lay and went up to my room to redecorate for the evening out.
==> It was a very nice evening on all counts. Dinner at Lily Rowan's, while not up to the standard Fritz had got my palate trained to, was always good. So was the show, and so was the dance band at the Flamingo Club, where we went afterward to get better acquainted, since I had only known her seven years. What with this and that I didn't get home until after three o'clock, and, following routine, looked in at the office to jiggle the handle of the safe and glance around. If there was a message for me Wolfe always left it on my desk under a paperweight, and there one was, on a sheet from his pad, in his small thin handwriting that was as easy to read as type. <==
I ran through it.

g: Your work on the Keyes case has been quite satisfactory. Now that it is solved, you may proceed as arranged and go to Mr. Hewitt's place on Long Island in the morning to get those plants. Theodore will have the cartons ready for you. Don't forget to watch the ventilation.

I sat at my desk and dialed a number. None of my closest friends or enemies was there, but I got a sergeant I knew named Rowley, and asked him, "On the Keyes case, do you need anything you haven't got?"
"Huh?" He always sounded hoarse. "We need everything. Send it C.O.D." "A guy told me you had it on ice."
"Aw, go to bed."
He was gone. I sat a moment and then dialed again, the number of the
Gazette office. Lon Cohen had gone home, but one of the journalists told me that as far as they knew the Keyes case was still back on a shelf, collecting dust.

In the Thursday morning papers there wasn't a single word in the coverage of the Keyes case to indicate that anyone had advanced even an inch in the hot pursuit of the murderer.
And I spent the whole day, from ten to six, driving to Lewis Hewitt's place on Long Island, helping to select and clean and pack ten dozen yearling plants, and driving back again. I did no visible fuming, but you can imagine my state of mind, and on my way home, when a cop stopped me as I was approaching Queensboro Bridge, and actually went so low as to ask me where the fire was, I had to get my tongue between my teeth to keep myself from going witty on him.
While I was lugging the last carton of plants up the stoop I had a surprise. A car I had often seen before, with PD on it, rolled up to the curb and stopped behind the sedan, and Inspector Cramer emerged from it.
"What has Wolfe got now?" he demanded, coming up the steps to me. "A dozen zygopetalum," I told him coldly, "a dozen renanthera, a dozen

I went on in. Cramer was in the red leather chair with an unlighted cigar tilted toward the ceiling by the grip of his teeth. Wolfe, his tightened lips showing that he was enjoying a quiet subdued rage, was frowning at him.
"I'm doing important work," I said curtly.
"It can wait. Get Mr. Skinner on the phone. If he has left his office, get him at home."
I would have gone to much greater lengths if Cramer hadn't been there. As it was, all I did was snort as I crossed to my desk and sat down and started to dial.
"Cut it!" Cramer barked savagely.

Cramer growled like a tiger in a cage having a chair poked at him.
"I don't understand," Wolfe declared, "why the devil I bother with you. Mr. Skinner would jump at it."
Cramer's growl became words. "When would it be - tonight?"
"I said you'd get details after I get your promise, but you may have that much. It would be early tomorrow morning, contingent upon delivery of a package I'm expecting - by the way, Archie, you didn't put the car in the garage?"

"Search me. I never know. You say you'll take my word. Why not take my word that I'll either do it or forget I ever heard it?"

Cramer uttered a word that was for men only. "You and your goddam charades," he said bitterly. "Why do you bother with me? You know damn well I'm not going to let you slip it to the D.A.'s office, because you may really have it. You have before. Okay. On your terms."
Wolfe nodded. The gleam in his eye came and went so fast that it nearly escaped even me.

"I'll explain gladly," I told Officer Hefferan, "if you'll descend from that horse and get level with me. That's the democratic way to do it. Do you want me to get a stiff neck, slanting up at you?"
I yawned wide without covering it, since there was nothing there but nature and a mounted cop. Being up and dressed and breakfasted and outdoors working at seven in the morning was not an all-time record for me, but it was unusual, and I had been up late three nights in a row: Tuesday the congregation of clients, Wednesday the festivities with Lily Rowan, and Thursday the drive to La Guardia to meet the airplane, which had been on schedule.
Hefferan came off his high horse and was even with me. We were posted on top of the little knoll in Central Park to which he had led me the day I had made his acquaintance. It promised to be another warm October day. A little breeze was having fun with the leaves on the trees and bushes, and birds were darting and hopping around, discussing their plans for the morning.

Down the slope to the bridle path I broke records, but on the other side it was upgrade, and also I had to dodge trees and bushes and jump railings. I was making no detours to find crossings, but heading on a bee-line for the noises

 coming from the east, including another round of shots. One funny thing, even busy as I was trying to cover ground, I was hoping they wouldn't hit that chestnut horse. Finally the border of the park was in sight, but I could see nothing moving, though the noises seemed to be louder and closer.
Straight ahead was the stone wall enclosing the park, and, unsure which way to turn for the nearest entrance, I made for the wall, climbed it, stood panting, and surveyed.
I was at Sixty-fifth and Fifth Avenue. One block up, outside a park entrance, the avenue was so cluttered that it was blocked. Cars, mostly taxis, were collecting at both fringes of the intersection, and the pedestrians who hadn't already arrived were on their way, from all directions. A bus had stopped and passengers were piling out. The tallest things there were the horses. I got the impression that there were a hell of a lot of horses, but probably it wasn't more than six or seven. They were all bays but one, the chestnut, and I was glad to see that it looked healthy as I cantered up the pavement toward the throng. The chestnut's saddle was empty.
==> I was pushing my way through to the center when one in uniform grabbed my arm, and I'll be damned if Officer Hefferan didn't sing out, "Let him come, that's Nero Wolfe's man Goodwin!" I would have been glad to thank him cordially, but didn't have enough breath yet to speak. So I merely pushed on and, using only my eyes, got my curiosity satisfied. <==
Victor Talbott, in blue jacket and yellow breeches, apparently as unhurt as the chestnut, was standing there with a city employee hanging onto each arm. His face was dirty and he looked very tired.

"You will be glad to know," I told Wolfe late that afternoon, "that none of these bills we are sending to our clients will have to be addressed care of the county jail. That would be embarrassing."
It was a little after six, and he was down from the plant rooms and had beer in front of him. I was at my typewriter, making out the bills.
"Broadyke," I went on, "claims that he merely bought designs that were offered him, not knowing where they came from, and he can probably make it stick. Dorothy has agreed on a settlement with Pohl and will press no charge. As for Dorothy, it's hers now anyway, as you said, so what the hell.

Wolfe grunted. "That won't improve their chances any."

"It wasn't wasted," Wolfe snapped. He can't stand being accused of wasting money. "There was a slim chance that Mr. Talbott had been ass enough to have his costume made right here. The better chance, of course, was one of the cities he had recently visited, and the best of all was the one farthest away. So I telephoned Los Angeles first, and the Southwest Agency put five men on it. Also Saul and Orrie did other things. Saul learned, for instance, that Mr. Talbott's room at the hotel was so situated that, by using stairs and a side entrance, he could easily have left and returned at that time of day without being recognized." Wolfe snorted. "I doubt if Mr. Cramer even considered that. Why should he? He had taken that policeman's word that he had seen Mr. Keyes on a horse, alive and well, at ten minutes past seven."
"Good here," I agreed. "But, assuming that it might have been the murderer, not Keyes, the cop had seen alive on a horse, why did you immediately pick Talbott for it?"
"I didn't. The facts did. The masquerade, if there was one, could have helped no one but Mr. Talbott, since an alibi for that moment at that spot would have been useless for any of the others. Also the greeting exchanged at a distance with the policeman was an essential of the plan, and only Mr. Talbott, who often rode with Mr. Keyes, could have known there would be an opportunity for it."
"Okay," I conceded. "And you phoned Pohl to find out where Talbott had been recently. My God, Pohl actually helped on it! By the way, the Southwest Agency put an airmail stamp on the envelope containing their bill, so I guess they want a check. Their part of the charge is reasonable enough, but that tailor wants three hundred bucks for making a blue jacket and a pair of yellow breeches."

I got up and handed the bills, including copies of the itemized expense account, across to Wolfe for his inspection.

When he got picked to double for Keyes that must have unsettled him a little to begin with. Then he gets ushered into the other room to change, and is handed a box that has on it 'Cleever of Hollywood.' He opens it, and there is an outfit exactly like the one he had had made, and had got well rid of somehow along with the gun, and there again is a label in the jacket, 'Cleever of Hollywood.' I'm surprised he was able to get it on and buttoned up, and walk out to the horse and climb into the saddle. He did have nerve.

"Give me back that expense list! I left out the ninety-five cents for Pohl's sandwiches!"

"Who do you think killed him if Vic didn't?"
"I don't know." The brows went up again. "But since I have inherited my father's business, and since 1 am engaged to marry Vic, and since a few other things, I want very much to know. That's why I'm here with you."
"You don't belong here!"
"I'm here, Ferdy."
"I say you don't belong!" Pohl's creases were wriggling. "I said so and I
==> still say so! We came, the four of us, for a definite purpose, to get Nero Wolfe to find proof that Vic killed your father!" Pohl suddenly uncrossed his legs, leaned forward to peer at Dorothy Keyes' face, and asked in a mean little voice, "And what if you helped him?" <==
Three other voices spoke at once. One said, "They're off again." Another, "Let Mr. Broadyke tell it."
Another, "Get one of them out of here."
Wolfe said, "If the job is limited to those terms, Mr. Pohl, to prove that a
man named by you committed murder, you've wasted your trip. What if he didn't?"
Many things had happened in that office on the ground floor of the old brownstone house owned by Nero Wolfe during the years I had worked for him as his man Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

This gathering in the office, on this Tuesday evening in October, had its own special angle of interest. Sigmund Keyes, top-drawer industrial designer, had been murdered the preceding Tuesday, just a week ago. I had read about it in the papers and had also found an opportunity to hear it privately discussed by my

 friend and enemy Sergeant Purley Stebbins of Homicide, and from the professional-detective slant it struck me as a lulu.
It had been Keyes' custom, five days a week at six-thirty in the morning, to take a walk in the park, and to do it the hard and silly way by walking on four legs instead of two. He kept the four legs, which he owned and which were named Casanova, at the Stillwell Riding Academy on Ninety-eighth Street just west of the park. That morning he mounted Casanova as usual, promptly at six- thirty, and rode into the park. Forty minutes later, at seven-ten, he had been seen by a mounted cop, in the park on patrol, down around Sixty-sixth Street. His customary schedule would have had him about there at that time. Twenty-five minutes later, at seven-thirty-five, Casanova, with his saddle uninhabited, had emerged from the park uptown and strolled down the street to the academy. Curiosity had naturally been aroused, and in three-quarters of an hour had been satisfied, when a park cop had found Keyes' body behind a thicket some twenty yards from the bridle path in the park, in the latitude of Ninety-fifth Street. Later a .38-caliber revolver bullet had been dug out of his chest. The police had concluded, from marks on the path and beyond its edge, that he had been shot out of his saddle and had crawled, with difficulty, up a little slope toward a paved walk for pedestrians, and hadn't had enough life left to make it.
A horseman shot from his saddle within sight of the Empire State Building was of course a natural for the tabloids, and the other papers thought well of it too. No weapon had been found, and no eyewitnesses. No citizen had even come forward to report seeing a masked man lurking behind a tree, probably because very few New Yorkers could possibly explain being up and dressed and strolling in the park at that hour of the morning.

"So you told him!" Pohl spat at Dorothy Keyes.
Dorothy merely raised her brows. I was getting fed up with that routine and wished she would try something else.
Audrey Rooney's mouth was hanging open. "Show him in," Wolfe told Fritz.
V
Like millions of my fellow citizens, I had done some sizing up of Victor Talbott from pictures of him in the papers, and within ten seconds after he had joined us in the office I had decided the label I had tied on him could stay. He was the guy who, at a cocktail party or before dinner, grabs the tray of appetizers and passes it around, looking into eyes and making cracks. Not counting me, he was easily the best-looking male in the room.
==> Entering, he shot a glance and a smile at Dorothy Keyes, ignored the others, came to a stop in front of Wolfe's desk, and said pleasantly, "You're Nero Wolfe, of course. I'm Vic Talbott. I suppose you'd rather not shake hands with me under the circumstances - that is, if you're accepting the job these people came to offer you. Are you?" <==
"How do you do, sir," Wolfe rumbled. "Good heavens, I've shaken hands

 with - how many murderers, Archie?"
"Oh - forty," I estimated.
"At least that. That's Mr. Goodwin, Mr. Talbott."

I had told them the Keyes case had knocked on our door and we had five suspects for clients, and that was all. Wolfe had not seen fit to tell me what their errands would be, so I was entertaining at cards instead of summarizing the notebooks for them. At eleven sharp we ended the game, and Orrie and I shelled out to Saul, as usual, and a few minutes later the door from the hail opened and Wolfe entered. He greeted the two hired hands, got himself installed behind his desk, rang for beer, and asked me, "You've explained things to Saul and Orrie, of course?"
"Certainly not. For all I knew it's classified." He grunted and told me to get Inspector Cramer. I dialed the number and had more trouble getting through than usual, finally had Cramer and signaled to Wolfe, and, since I got no sign to
"Forty trump," Orrie Cather said at 10:55 Wednesday morning.

==> an usual, finally had Cramer and signaled to Wolfe, and, since I got no sign to keep off, I stayed on. It wasn't much of a conversation. "Mr. Cramer? Nero Wolfe." <==
"Yeah. What do you want?"
"I'm sorry I was busy last evening. It's always a pleasure to see you. I've been engaged in the matter of Mr. Keyes' death, and it will be to our mutual interest for you to let me have a little routine information."
"Like what?"
"To begin with, the name and number of the mounted policeman who saw Mr. Keyes in the park at ten minutes past seven that morning. I want to send Archie - "
"Go to hell." The connection went.

"Oh," he said, "one of our prominent kidders, huh?"
I made for cover. "About as prominent," I declared, "as a fish egg in a bowl of caviar."
"Oh, you eat caviar."
"Goddam it," I muttered, "let's start over again." I walked four paces to a lamp post, wheeled, returned to him, and announced, "My name's Goodwin and I

==>  work for Nero Wolfe. Headquarters said I could ask you a couple of questions and I'd appreciate it." <==
"Uh-huh. A friend of mine in the Fifteenth Squad has told me about you. You damn near got him sent to the marshes."
"Then you were already prejudiced. So was I, but not against you. Not even against your horse. Speaking of horses, that morning you saw Keyes on his horse, not long before he was killed, what time was it?"
"Ten minutes past seven."
"Within a minute or two?"
"Not within anything. Ten minutes past seven. I was on the early shift

Down the slope to the bridle path I broke records, but on the other side it was upgrade, and also I had to dodge trees and bushes and jump railings. I was making no detours to find crossings, but heading on a bee-line for the noises

 coming from the east, including another round of shots. One funny thing, even busy as I was trying to cover ground, I was hoping they wouldn't hit that chestnut horse. Finally the border of the park was in sight, but I could see nothing moving, though the noises seemed to be louder and closer.
Straight ahead was the stone wall enclosing the park, and, unsure which way to turn for the nearest entrance, I made for the wall, climbed it, stood panting, and surveyed.
I was at Sixty-fifth and Fifth Avenue. One block up, outside a park entrance, the avenue was so cluttered that it was blocked. Cars, mostly taxis, were collecting at both fringes of the intersection, and the pedestrians who hadn't already arrived were on their way, from all directions. A bus had stopped and passengers were piling out. The tallest things there were the horses. I got the impression that there were a hell of a lot of horses, but probably it wasn't more than six or seven. They were all bays but one, the chestnut, and I was glad to see that it looked healthy as I cantered up the pavement toward the throng. The chestnut's saddle was empty.
==> I was pushing my way through to the center when one in uniform grabbed my arm, and I'll be damned if Officer Hefferan didn't sing out, "Let him come, that's Nero Wolfe's man Goodwin!" I would have been glad to thank him cordially, but didn't have enough breath yet to speak. So I merely pushed on and, using only my eyes, got my curiosity satisfied. <==
Victor Talbott, in blue jacket and yellow breeches, apparently as unhurt as the chestnut, was standing there with a city employee hanging onto each arm. His face was dirty and he looked very tired.

"You will be glad to know," I told Wolfe late that afternoon, "that none of these bills we are sending to our clients will have to be addressed care of the county jail. That would be embarrassing."
It was a little after six, and he was down from the plant rooms and had beer in front of him. I was at my typewriter, making out the bills.
"Broadyke," I went on, "claims that he merely bought designs that were offered him, not knowing where they came from, and he can probably make it stick. Dorothy has agreed on a settlement with Pohl and will press no charge. As for Dorothy, it's hers now anyway, as you said, so what the hell. And Safford and Audrey can't be prosecuted just for going to ride in the park, even if they

Like millions of my fellow citizens, I had done some sizing up of Victor Talbott from pictures of him in the papers, and within ten seconds after he had joined us in the office I had decided the label I had tied on him could stay. He was the guy who, at a cocktail party or before dinner, grabs the tray of appetizers and passes it around, looking into eyes and making cracks. Not counting me, he was easily the best-looking male in the room.
Entering, he shot a glance and a smile at Dorothy Keyes, ignored the others, came to a stop in front of Wolfe's desk, and said pleasantly, "You're Nero Wolfe, of course. I'm Vic Talbott. I suppose you'd rather not shake hands with me under the circumstances - that is, if you're accepting the job these people came to offer you. Are you?"
"How do you do, sir," Wolfe rumbled. "Good heavens, I've shaken hands

==>  with - how many murderers, Archie?" <==
"Oh - forty," I estimated.
"At least that. That's Mr. Goodwin, Mr. Talbott."
Evidently Vic figured I might be squeamish too, for he gave me a nod but
extended no hand. Then he turned to face the guests. "What about it, folks? Have you hired the great detective?"
"Nuts," Wayne Safford squeaked at him. "You come prancing in, huh?"

"Permit me to say," Broadyke put in, "that it does seem an excess of hospitality."
"By the way, Vic" - it was Dorothy's soft voice - "Ferdy says I was your accomplice."
The remarks from the others had made no visible impression on him, but it was different with Dorothy. He turned to her, and the look on his face was good for a whole chapter in his biography. He was absolutely all hers unless I needed an oculist. She could lift her lovely brows a thousand times a day without feeding him up. He let his eyes speak to her and then wheeled to use his tongue for Pohl. "Do you know what I think of you, Ferdy? I guess you do!"
"If you please," Wolfe said sharply. "You don't need my office for exchanging your opinions of one another; you can do that anywhere. We have work to do. Mr. Talbott, you asked if I've accepted a job that has been offered me. I have. I have engaged to investigate the murder of Sigmund Keyes. But I have received no confidences and can still decline it. Have you a better offer? What did you come here for?"
Talbott smiled at him. "That's the way to talk," he said admiringly. "No, I have nothing to offer in the way of a job, but I felt I ought to be in on this. I figured it this way: they were going to hire you to get me arrested for murder, so naturally you would like to have a look at me and ask me some questions - and here I am."
==> "Pleading not guilty, of course. Archie. A chair for Mr. Talbott." <==
"Of course," he agreed, thanking me with a smile for the chair I brought, and sitting down. "Otherwise you'd have no job. Shoot." Suddenly he flushed. "Under the circumstances, I guess I shouldn't have said shoot.'"
"You could have said 'Fire away,' " Wayne Safford piped up from the rear. "Be quiet, Wayne," Audrey Rooney scolded him.


"Permit me - " Broadyke began, but Wolfe cut him off.

"I'm coming in, Goodwin."
"Come ahead. This chain has never had a real test, and I've wondered about it."
"In the name of the law, open this door!" I was so astonished that I nearly did open it in order to get a good look at him. Through the crack I could use only one eye. "Well, listen to you," I said incredulously. "On me you try that? As you know, it's the law that keeps you out. If you're ready to make an arrest, tell me who, and I'll see that he or she doesn't pull a scoot. After all, you're not a monopoly. You've had them for a full week, day or night, and Wolfe has had them only an hour or so, and you can't bear it! Incidentally, they're not refusing to see you, they don't know you're here, so don't chalk that against them. It's Mr. Wolfe who can't be disturbed. I'll give you this much satisfaction: he hasn't solved it yet, and it may take till midnight. It will save time if you'll give me the names - "
"Shut up," Cramer rasped. "I came here perfectly friendly. There's no law against Wolfe having people in his office. And there's no law against my being there with them, either."
"There sure isn't," I agreed heartily, "once you're in, but what about this door? Here's a legal door, with a man on one side who can't open it, and a man on the other side who won't, and according to the statutes - "
==> "Archie!" It was a bellow from the office, Wolfe's loudest bellow, seldom heard, and there were other sounds. It came again. "Archie!" <==


I said hastily, "Excuse me," slammed the door shut, ran down the hall and
turned the knob, and popped in.
It was nothing seriously alarming. Wolfe was still in his chair behind his

"You did very well, Vic," Dorothy was saying. "You were fantastically handsome with the gleam of battle in your eye." She put her palms against Talbott's cheeks, pulled his head forward, and stretched her neck to kiss him on the lips - a quick one. "There!"
"Vic is going now," I told her. "Come on, Talbott, I'll let you out."
Before he came he enfolded Dorothy in his arms. I glanced at Safford, expecting him to counter by enfolding Audrey, but he was standing by with his

 fists still doubled up. So I herded Talbott out of the room ahead of me. In the hall, while he was getting his hat and coat, I took a look through the one-way panel, saw that the stoop was clear, and opened the door. As he crossed the sill I told him, "You go for the head too much. You'll break a hand that way someday."
==> Back in the office someone had righted the overturned chair, and they were all seated again. Apparently, though her knight had been given the boot, Dorothy was going to stick. As I crossed to resume my place at my desk Wolfe was saying, "We got interrupted, Miss Rooney. As I said, you seem to be the most vulnerable, since you were on the scene. Will you please move a little closer - that chair there? Archie, your notebook." <==
VI
At 10:55 the next morning I was sitting in the office - not still, but again - waiting for Wolfe to come down from the plant rooms on the roof, where he keeps ten thousand orchids and an assortment of other specimens of vegetation. I was playing three-handed pinochle with Saul Panzer and Orrie Cather, who had been phoned to come in for a job. Saul always wore an old brown cap, was undersized and homely, with a big nose, and was the best field man in the world for everything that could be done without a dinner jacket. Orrie, who would be able to get along without a hairbrush in a few years, was by no means up to Saul but was a good all-round man.
At 10:55 I was three bucks down.
In a drawer of my desk were two notebookfuls.
Wolfe hadn't kept the clients all night, but there hadn't been much left of it

[line number in individual story] matching line = 283    window = 278 288

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 37351    window = 37346 37356



an usual, finally had Cramer and signaled to Wolfe, and, since I got no sign to keep off, I stayed on. It wasn't much of a conversation. "Mr. Cramer? Nero Wolfe."
"Yeah. What do you want?"
"I'm sorry I was busy last evening. It's always a pleasure to see you. I've been engaged in the matter of Mr. Keyes' death, and it will be to our mutual interest for you to let me have a little routine information."
"Like what?"
==> "To begin with, the name and number of the mounted policeman who saw Mr. Keyes in the park at ten minutes past seven that morning. I want to send Archie - " <==
"Go to hell." The connection went.
Wolfe hung up, reached for the beer tray which Fritz had brought in, and told me, "Get Mr. Skinner of the District Attorney's office."
I did so, and Wolfe got on again. In the past Skinner had had his share of moments of irritation with Wolfe, but at least he hadn't had the door slammed in his face the preceding evening and therefore was not boorish. When he learned that Wolfe was on the Keyes case he wanted to know plenty, but Wolfe stiff- armed him without being too rude and soon had what he was after. Upon Wolfe's assurance that he would keep Skinner posted on developments at his end, which they both knew was a barefaced lie, the Assistant D.A. even offered to ask headquarters to arrange for me to see the cop. And did so. In less than ten minutes after Wolfe and he were finished, a call came from Centre Street to tell me that Officer Hefferan would meet me at 11:45 at the corner of Sixty-sixth Street and Central Park West.
During the less than ten minutes, Wolfe had drunk beer, asked Saul about his family, and told me what I was expected to find out from the cop. That made me sore, but even more it made me curious. When we're on a case it sometimes happens that Wolfe gets the notion that I have got involved on some angle or with some member of the cast, and that therefore it is necessary to switch me temporarily onto a siding. I had about given up wasting nervous energy resenting it. But what was it this time? I had bought nobody's version and was absolutely fancy free, so why should he send me out to chew the rag with a cop and keep Saul and Orrie for more important errands? It was beyond me, and I was glaring at him and about to open up, when the phone rang again.
It was Ferdinand Pohl, asking for Wolfe. I was going to keep out of it, since the main attack was to be entrusted to others, but Wolfe motioned me to stay on.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 37364    window = 37359 37369



"Certainly not," Wolfe said in a grieved tone. It always riled him that
anybody in the world didn't know that he never left his house on business, and rarely for anything whatever. "I work only at home. What's the matter?"
"There's someone here I want you to talk to. Two members of the staff. With their testimony I can prove that Talbott took those designs and sold them to Broadyke. This clinches it that it was Talbott who killed Keyes. Of us five, the only ones that could possibly be suspected were Miss Rooney and that stable hand, with that mutual alibi they had, and this clears her - and him too, of course."
"Nonsense. It does nothing of the sort. It proves that she was unjustly accused of theft, and an unjust accusation rankles more than a just one. Now you can have Mr. Talbott charged with larceny, at least. I'm extremely busy. Thank you very much for calling. I shall need the cooperation of all of you."
==> Pohl wanted to prolong it, but Wolfe got rid of him, drank more beer, and turned to me. "You're expected there in twenty minutes, Archie, and considering your tendency to get arrested for speeding - " <==
I had had one ticket for speeding in eight years. I walked to the door but turned to remark bitterly, "If you think you're just sending me out to play, try again. Who was the last to see Keyes alive? The cop. He did it. And who will I deliver him to - you? No. Inspector Cramer!"
VIII
It was sunny and warm for October, and the drive uptown would have been pleasant if I hadn't been prejudiced by my feeling that I was being imposed on. Parking on Sixty-fifth Street, I walked around the corner and up a block, and crossed Central Park West to where a man in uniform was monkeying with his horse's bridle. I have met a pack of guardians of the peace on my rounds, but this rugged manly face with a pushed-in nose and bright big eyes was new to me. I introduced myself and showed credentials and said it was nice of him, busy as he was, to give me his time. Of course that was a blunder, but I've admitted I was prejudiced.
"Oh," he said, "one of our prominent kidders, huh?"
I made for cover. "About as prominent," I declared, "as a fish egg in a bowl of caviar."

"Good. May I pat your horse?"
"No."
"Then I won't. It would suit me fine if the occasion arose someday for me
to pat you. When I'm dining with the inspector this evening I'll put in a word for you, not saying what kind."
I hoofed it out of the park and along Sixty-sixth Street to Broadway, found a drugstore and a phone booth, wriggled onto the stool, and dialed my favorite number. It was Orrie Gather's voice that answered. So, I remarked to myself, he's still there, probably sitting at my desk; Wolfe's instructions for him must be awful complicated. I asked for Wolfe and got him.
==> "Yes, Archie?" <==
"I am phoning as instructed. Officer Hefferan is a Goodwin-hater, but I

 swallowed my pride. On the stand he would swear up and down that he saw Keyes at the place and time as given, and I guess he did, but a good lawyer could shoot it full of ifs and buts."
"Why? Is Mr. Hefferan a shuttlecock?"
"By no means. He knows it all. But it wasn't a closeup."

I got tired waiting and repeated it. "Mr. Donaldson is here to see you."


"I - " She wet her lips. In a moment she swallowed. In another moment she stood up, said in a voice not soft at all, "Tell her to send him to Mr. Talbott's room," and went.
I forwarded the command as instructed, asked for an outside line, and, when I heard the dial tone, fingered the number. My wrist watch said five past three, and it stopped my tongue for a second when once more I heard Orrie's voice.
==> "Archie," I said shortly. "Let me speak to Saul." "Saul? He's not here. Been gone for hours." "Oh, I thought it was a party. Then Wolfe." Wolfe's voice came. "Yes, Archie?" <==
"I'm in Keyes' office, sitting at his desk. I'm alone. I brought Pohl his lunch, and he owes me ninety-five cents. It just occurred to me that I've seen you go to great lengths to keep your clients from being arrested. Remember the time you buried Clara Fox in a box of osmundine and turned the hose on her? Or the time - "
"What about it?"
"They're scooping up all the clients, that's all. Broadyke has been collared for receiving stolen goods - the designs he bought from Talbott. Pohl has been pulled in for disturbing the peace, and Talbott for assault and battery. Not to mention that Miss Keyes has just had the daylights scared out of her."
"What are you talking about? What happened?"
I told him and, since he had nothing to do but sit and let Orrie answer the phone for him, I left nothing out. When I was through I offered the suggestion that it might be a good plan for me to stick around and find out what it was about Mr. Donaldson that made young women tremble and turn pale at sound of his name.

"Let me by," he said rudely.
I did so.
What I should have done, to drive it in that I was now a delivery boy and
==> not a detective, was to go on helping Theodore get the orchids upstairs, and I set my teeth and started to do that, but it wasn't long before Wolfe's bellow came from the office. "Archie!" <==
I went on in. Cramer was in the red leather chair with an unlighted cigar tilted toward the ceiling by the grip of his teeth. Wolfe, his tightened lips showing that he was enjoying a quiet subdued rage, was frowning at him.
"I'm doing important work," I said curtly.
"It can wait. Get Mr. Skinner on the phone. If he has left his office, get him at home."
I would have gone to much greater lengths if Cramer hadn't been there. As it was, all I did was snort as I crossed to my desk and sat down and started to dial.
"Cut it!" Cramer barked savagely.

I went on dialing.
"I said stop it!"
==> "That will do, Archie," Wolfe told me. I turned from the phone and saw he <==
was still frowning at the inspector but his lips had relaxed. He used them for speech. "I don't see, Mr. Cramer, what better you can ask than the choice I offer. As I told you on the phone, give me your word that you'll cooperate with me on my terms, and I shall at once tell you about it in full detail, including of course the justification for it. Or refuse to give me your word, that's the alternative, and I shall ask Mr. Skinner if the District Attorney's office would like to cooperate with me. I guarantee only that no harm will be done, but my expectation is that the case will be closed. Isn't that fair enough?"
Cramer growled like a tiger in a cage having a chair poked at him.
"I don't understand," Wolfe declared, "why the devil I bother with you. Mr. Skinner would jump at it."
Cramer's growl became words. "When would it be - tonight?"
"I said you'd get details after I get your promise, but you may have that much. It would be early tomorrow morning, contingent upon delivery of a package I'm expecting - by the way, Archie, you didn't put the car in the garage?"

"No, sir."
"Good. You'll have to go later, probably around midnight, to meet an airplane. It depends on the airplane, Mr. Cramer. If it arrives tomorrow instead

 of tonight, we'd have to postpone it until Saturday morning."
"Where? Here in your office?"

 of tonight, we'd have to postpone it until Saturday morning."
"Where? Here in your office?"
Wolfe shook his head. "That's one of the details you'll get. Confound it, do I mean what I say?"
"Search me. I never know. You say you'll take my word. Why not take my word that I'll either do it or forget I ever heard it?"
==> "No. Archie, get Mr. Skinner." <==
Cramer uttered a word that was for men only. "You and your goddam charades," he said bitterly. "Why do you bother with me? You know damn well I'm not going to let you slip it to the D.A.'s office, because you may really have it. You have before. Okay. On your terms."
Wolfe nodded. The gleam in his eye came and went so fast that it nearly escaped even me.
"Your notebook, Archie. This is rather elaborate, and I doubt if we can finish before dinner."

"I'll explain gladly," I told Officer Hefferan, "if you'll descend from that horse and get level with me. That's the democratic way to do it. Do you want me to get a stiff neck, slanting up at you?"

"I'll explain gladly," I told Officer Hefferan, "if you'll descend from that horse and get level with me. That's the democratic way to do it. Do you want me to get a stiff neck, slanting up at you?"
I yawned wide without covering it, since there was nothing there but nature and a mounted cop. Being up and dressed and breakfasted and outdoors working at seven in the morning was not an all-time record for me, but it was unusual, and I had been up late three nights in a row: Tuesday the congregation of clients, Wednesday the festivities with Lily Rowan, and Thursday the drive to La Guardia to meet the airplane, which had been on schedule.
Hefferan came off his high horse and was even with me. We were posted on top of the little knoll in Central Park to which he had led me the day I had made his acquaintance. It promised to be another warm October day. A little breeze was having fun with the leaves on the trees and bushes, and birds were darting and hopping around, discussing their plans for the morning.
"All I'm doing," Hefferan said to make it plain, "is obeying orders. I was told to meet you here and listen to you."

 chain bolt, pulled the door open the two inches the Chain would permit, and spoke through the crack. "I don't want to catch cold."
"Neither do I," a gruff voice told me. "Take that damn bolt off." "Mr. Wolfe is engaged," I said politely. "Will I do?"
"You will not. You never have and you never will."
"Then hold it a minute. I'll see."

I returned to the front, opened to the crack again, and said regretfully, "Sorry, but he's doing his homework."
"Yeah," Cramer said sarcastically, "he certainly is. Now that Talbott's here too you've got a full house. All six of 'em. Open the door."
"Bah. Who are you trying to impress? You have tails on one or more, possibly all, and I do hope you haven't abandoned Talbott because we like him. By the way, the phone girl and the waiter at the Churchill - what're their names?"

If you're ready to make an arrest, tell me who, and I'll see that he or she doesn't pull a scoot. After all, you're not a monopoly. You've had them for a full week, day or night, and Wolfe has had them only an hour or so, and you can't bear it! Incidentally, they're not refusing to see you, they don't know you're here, so don't chalk that against them. It's Mr. Wolfe who can't be disturbed. I'll give you this much satisfaction: he hasn't solved it yet, and it may take till midnight. It will save time if you'll give me the names - "
"Shut up," Cramer rasped. "I came here perfectly friendly. There's no law against Wolfe having people in his office. And there's no law against my being there with them, either."

"Yeah," Cramer said sarcastically, "he certainly is. Now that Talbott's here too you've got a full house. All six of 'em. Open the door."
"Bah. Who are you trying to impress? You have tails on one or more, possibly all, and I do hope you haven't abandoned Talbott because we like him. By the way, the phone girl and the waiter at the Churchill - what're their names?"
"I'm coming in, Goodwin."
"Come ahead. This chain has never had a real test, and I've wondered about it."

"There sure isn't," I agreed heartily, "once you're in, but what about this door? Here's a legal door, with a man on one side who can't open it, and a man on the other side who won't, and according to the statutes - "
"Archie!" It was a bellow from the office, Wolfe's loudest bellow, seldom heard, and there were other sounds. It came again. "Archie!"


I said hastily, "Excuse me," slammed the door shut, ran down the hall and

"A woman either being wronged or caught wronging another. In either
case, unhinged."
"Also he poked her with his crop."
"No," Wolfe disagreed. "Except in immediate and urgent retaliation, no
woman ever retorts to physical violence from a man in kind. It would not be womanly. She devises subtleties." He got to his feet. "I'm sleepy." He started for the door.
==> Following, I told his back, "I know one thing, I would collect from every damn one of them in advance. I can't imagine why Cramer wanted to see them again, even Talbott, after a whole week with them. Why don't he throw in and draw five new cards? He's sore as a pup. Shall we phone him?" <==
"No." We were in the hall. Wolfe, heading for the elevator to ascend to his room on the second floor, turned. "What did he want?"
"He didn't say, but I can guess. He's at a dead stop in pitch-dark in the middle of a six corners, and he came to see if you've got a road map."
I made for the stairs, since the elevator is only four by six, and with all of Wolfe inside, it would already be cramped.
VII
I had told them the Keyes case had knocked on our door and we had five suspects for clients, and that was all. Wolfe had not seen fit to tell me what their errands would be, so I was entertaining at cards instead of summarizing the notebooks for them. At eleven sharp we ended the game, and Orrie and I shelled out to Saul, as usual, and a few minutes later the door from the hail opened and Wolfe entered. He greeted the two hired hands, got himself installed behind his desk, rang for beer, and asked me, "You've explained things to Saul and Orrie, of course?"

"To begin with, the name and number of the mounted policeman who saw Mr. Keyes in the park at ten minutes past seven that morning. I want to send Archie - "
"Go to hell." The connection went.

"Certainly not," Wolfe said in a grieved tone. It always riled him that
anybody in the world didn't know that he never left his house on business, and rarely for anything whatever. "I work only at home. What's the matter?"
"There's someone here I want you to talk to. Two members of the staff. With their testimony I can prove that Talbott took those designs and sold them to Broadyke. This clinches it that it was Talbott who killed Keyes. Of us five, the only ones that could possibly be suspected were Miss Rooney and that stable hand, with that mutual alibi they had, and this clears her - and him too, of course."
"Nonsense. It does nothing of the sort. It proves that she was unjustly accused of theft, and an unjust accusation rankles more than a just one. Now you can have Mr. Talbott charged with larceny, at least. I'm extremely busy. Thank you very much for calling. I shall need the cooperation of all of you."
Pohl wanted to prolong it, but Wolfe got rid of him, drank more beer, and turned to me. "You're expected there in twenty minutes, Archie, and considering your tendency to get arrested for speeding - "
==> I had had one ticket for speeding in eight years. I walked to the door but turned to remark bitterly, "If you think you're just sending me out to play, try again. Who was the last to see Keyes alive? The cop. He did it. And who will I deliver him to - you? No. Inspector Cramer!" <==

It was sunny and warm for October, and the drive uptown would have been pleasant if I hadn't been prejudiced by my feeling that I was being imposed on. Parking on Sixty-fifth Street, I walked around the corner and up a block, and crossed Central Park West to where a man in uniform was monkeying with his horse's bridle. I have met a pack of guardians of the peace on my rounds, but this rugged manly face with a pushed-in nose and bright big eyes was new to me. I introduced myself and showed credentials and said it was nice of him, busy as he was, to give me his time. Of course that was a blunder, but I've admitted I was prejudiced.
"Oh," he said, "one of our prominent kidders, huh?"
I made for cover. "About as prominent," I declared, "as a fish egg in a bowl of caviar."
"Oh, you eat caviar."

Gazette office. Lon Cohen had gone home, but one of the journalists told me that as far as they knew the Keyes case was still back on a shelf, collecting dust.
I crumpled Wolfe's message and tossed it in the wastebasket, muttered, "The damn fat faker," and went up to bed.
XIII
In the Thursday morning papers there wasn't a single word in the coverage of the Keyes case to indicate that anyone had advanced even an inch in the hot pursuit of the murderer.
And I spent the whole day, from ten to six, driving to Lewis Hewitt's place on Long Island, helping to select and clean and pack ten dozen yearling plants, and driving back again. I did no visible fuming, but you can imagine my state of mind, and on my way home, when a cop stopped me as I was approaching Queensboro Bridge, and actually went so low as to ask me where the fire was, I had to get my tongue between my teeth to keep myself from going witty on him.
==> While I was lugging the last carton of plants up the stoop I had a surprise. A car I had often seen before, with PD on it, rolled up to the curb and stopped behind the sedan, and Inspector Cramer emerged from it. <==
"What has Wolfe got now?" he demanded, coming up the steps to me. "A dozen zygopetalum," I told him coldly, "a dozen renanthera, a dozen

 odontoglossum - "
"Let me by," he said rudely.
I did so.

 odontoglossum - "
"Let me by," he said rudely.
I did so.
What I should have done, to drive it in that I was now a delivery boy and
not a detective, was to go on helping Theodore get the orchids upstairs, and I set my teeth and started to do that, but it wasn't long before Wolfe's bellow came from the office. "Archie!"
==> I went on in. Cramer was in the red leather chair with an unlighted cigar tilted toward the ceiling by the grip of his teeth. Wolfe, his tightened lips showing that he was enjoying a quiet subdued rage, was frowning at him. <==
"I'm doing important work," I said curtly.
"It can wait. Get Mr. Skinner on the phone. If he has left his office, get him at home."
I would have gone to much greater lengths if Cramer hadn't been there. As it was, all I did was snort as I crossed to my desk and sat down and started to dial.
"Cut it!" Cramer barked savagely.
I went on dialing.

"That will do, Archie," Wolfe told me. I turned from the phone and saw he
was still frowning at the inspector but his lips had relaxed. He used them for speech. "I don't see, Mr. Cramer, what better you can ask than the choice I offer. As I told you on the phone, give me your word that you'll cooperate with me on my terms, and I shall at once tell you about it in full detail, including of course the justification for it.

Cramer's growl became words. "When would it be - tonight?"
"I said you'd get details after I get your promise, but you may have that much. It would be early tomorrow morning, contingent upon delivery of a package I'm expecting - by the way, Archie, you didn't put the car in the garage?"

Wolfe nodded. The gleam in his eye came and went so fast that it nearly escaped even me.
"Your notebook, Archie. This is rather elaborate, and I doubt if we can finish before dinner."

"I'll explain gladly," I told Officer Hefferan, "if you'll descend from that horse and get level with me. That's the democratic way to do it. Do you want me to get a stiff neck, slanting up at you?"
I yawned wide without covering it, since there was nothing there but nature and a mounted cop. Being up and dressed and breakfasted and outdoors working at seven in the morning was not an all-time record for me, but it was unusual, and I had been up late three nights in a row: Tuesday the congregation of clients, Wednesday the festivities with Lily Rowan, and Thursday the drive to La Guardia to meet the airplane, which had been on schedule.

Hefferan came off his high horse and was even with me. We were posted on top of the little knoll in Central Park to which he had led me the day I had made his acquaintance. It promised to be another warm October day. A little breeze was having fun with the leaves on the trees and bushes, and birds were darting and hopping around, discussing their plans for the morning.
"All I'm doing," Hefferan said to make it plain, "is obeying orders. I was told to meet you here and listen to you."
I nodded. "And you don't care for it. Neither do I, you stiff-backed Cossack, but I've got orders too. The setup is like this. As you know, down there behind that forest" - I pointed - "is a tool shed. Outside the shed Keyes' chestnut

==>  horse, saddled and bridled, is being held by one of your colleagues. Inside the shed there are two women named Keyes and Rooney, and four men named Pohl, Talbott, Safford, and Broadyke. Also Inspector Cramer is there with a detachment from his squad. One of the six civilians, chosen by secret ballot, is at this moment changing his or her clothes, putting on bright yellow breeches and a blue jacket, just like the outfit Keyes wore. Between you and me and your horse, the choosing was a put-up job, handled by Inspector Cramer. Dressed like Keyes, the chosen one is going to mount Keyes' horse and ride along that stretch of the bridle path, with shoulders hunched and stirrups too long, catch sight of you, and lift his or her crop to you in greeting. Your part is to be an honest man. Pretend it's not me telling you this, but someone you dearly love like the Police Commissioner. You are asked to remember that what you were interested in seeing was the horse, not the rider, and to put the question to yourself, did you actually recognize Keyes that morning, or just the horse and the getup?" <==
I appealed to him earnestly. "And for God's sake don't say a word to me. You wouldn't admit anything whatever to me, so keep your trap shut and save it for later, for your superiors. A lot depends on you, which may be regrettable, but it can't be helped now.
"If it won't offend you for me to explain the theory of it, it's this: The murderer, dressed like Keyes but covered with a topcoat, was waiting in the park uptown behind that thicket at half-past six, when Keyes first rode into the park and got onto the bridle path. If he had shot Keyes out of the saddle from a distance, even a short one, the horse would have bolted, so he stepped out and stopped Keyes, and got hold of the bridle before he pulled the trigger. One bullet for one. Then he dragged the body behind the thicket so it couldn't be seen from the bridle path, since another early-morning rider might come along, took off his topcoat - or maybe a thin raincoat - and stuffed it under his jacket, mounted the horse, and went for a ride through the park. He took his time so as to keep to Keyes' customary schedule. Thirty minutes later, approaching that spot" - I pointed to where the bridle path emerged from behind the trees - "he either saw you up here or waited until he did see you up here, and then he rode on along that stretch, giving you the usual salute by lifting his crop. But the second he got out of sight at the other end of the stretch he acted fast. He got off the horse and just left it there, knowing it would make its way back to its own exit from the park, and he beat it in a hurry, either to a Fifth Avenue bus or the subway, depending on where he was headed for. The idea was to turn the alibi on as soon as possible, since he couldn't be sure how soon the horse would be seen and the search for Keyes would be started. But at the worst he had established Keyes as still alive at ten minutes past seven, down here on the stretch, and the body would be found way uptown."


"I believe," Hefferan said stiffly, "I am on record as saying I saw Keyes." "Scratch it," I urged him. "Blot it out. Make your mind a blank, which

"Broadyke," I went on, "claims that he merely bought designs that were offered him, not knowing where they came from, and he can probably make it stick. Dorothy has agreed on a settlement with Pohl and will press no charge. As for Dorothy, it's hers now anyway, as you said, so what the hell. And Safford and Audrey can't be prosecuted just for going to ride in the park, even if they

 omitted it in their statements just to avoid complications. By the way, if you wonder why they allocated fifteen per cent of our fee to a stable hand, he is not a stable hand. He owns that riding academy, by gum, so Audrey hasn't sold out cheap at all - anything but. They'll probably be married on horseback."
Wolfe grunted. "That won't improve their chances any."
"You're prejudiced about marriage," I reproached him. "I may try it myself someday. Look at Saul, staked down like a tent but absolutely happy. Speaking of Saul, why did you waste money having him and Orrie phoning and calling on New York tailors?"
==> "It wasn't wasted," Wolfe snapped. He can't stand being accused of wasting money. "There was a slim chance that Mr. Talbott had been ass enough to have his costume made right here. The better chance, of course, was one of the cities he had recently visited, and the best of all was the one farthest away. So I telephoned Los Angeles first, and the Southwest Agency put five men on it. Also Saul and Orrie did other things. Saul learned, for instance, that Mr. Talbott's room at the hotel was so situated that, by using stairs and a side entrance, he could easily have left and returned at that time of day without being recognized." Wolfe snorted. "I doubt if Mr. Cramer even considered that. Why should he? He had taken that policeman's word that he had seen Mr. Keyes on a horse, alive and well, at ten minutes past seven." <==
"Good here," I agreed. "But, assuming that it might have been the murderer, not Keyes, the cop had seen alive on a horse, why did you immediately pick Talbott for it?"
"I didn't. The facts did. The masquerade, if there was one, could have helped no one but Mr. Talbott, since an alibi for that moment at that spot would have been useless for any of the others. Also the greeting exchanged at a distance with the policeman was an essential of the plan, and only Mr. Talbott, who often rode with Mr. Keyes, could have known there would be an opportunity for it."
"Okay," I conceded. "And you phoned Pohl to find out where Talbott had been recently. My God, Pohl actually helped on it! By the way, the Southwest Agency put an airmail stamp on the envelope containing their bill, so I guess they want a check. Their part of the charge is reasonable enough, but that tailor wants three hundred bucks for making a blue jacket and a pair of yellow breeches."
"Which our clients will pay," Wolfe said placidly. "It isn't exorbitant. It was five o'clock in the afternoon there when they found him, and he had to be persuaded to spend the night at it, duplicating the previous order."
"Okay," I conceded again. "I admit it had to be a real duplicate, label and

Wolfe said, "If the job is limited to those terms, Mr. Pohl, to prove that a
man named by you committed murder, you've wasted your trip. What if he didn't?"
Many things had happened in that office on the ground floor of the old brownstone house owned by Nero Wolfe during the years I had worked for him as his man Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
This gathering in the office, on this Tuesday evening in October, had its own special angle of interest. Sigmund Keyes, top-drawer industrial designer, had been murdered the preceding Tuesday, just a week ago. I had read about it in the papers and had also found an opportunity to hear it privately discussed by my

==>  friend and enemy Sergeant Purley Stebbins of Homicide, and from the professional-detective slant it struck me as a lulu. <==
It had been Keyes' custom, five days a week at six-thirty in the morning, to take a walk in the park, and to do it the hard and silly way by walking on four legs instead of two. He kept the four legs, which he owned and which were named Casanova, at the Stillwell Riding Academy on Ninety-eighth Street just west of the park. That morning he mounted Casanova as usual, promptly at six- thirty, and rode into the park. Forty minutes later, at seven-ten, he had been seen by a mounted cop, in the park on patrol, down around Sixty-sixth Street. His customary schedule would have had him about there at that time. Twenty-five minutes later, at seven-thirty-five, Casanova, with his saddle uninhabited, had emerged from the park uptown and strolled down the street to the academy. Curiosity had naturally been aroused, and in three-quarters of an hour had been satisfied, when a park cop had found Keyes' body behind a thicket some twenty yards from the bridle path in the park, in the latitude of Ninety-fifth Street. Later a .38-caliber revolver bullet had been dug out of his chest. The police had concluded, from marks on the path and beyond its edge, that he had been shot out of his saddle and had crawled, with difficulty, up a little slope toward a paved walk for pedestrians, and hadn't had enough life left to make it.
A horseman shot from his saddle within sight of the Empire State Building was of course a natural for the tabloids, and the other papers thought well of it too. No weapon had been found, and no eyewitnesses. No citizen had even come forward to report seeing a masked man lurking behind a tree, probably because very few New Yorkers could possibly explain being up and dressed and strolling in the park at that hour of the morning.
So the city employees had had to start at the other end and look for motives and opportunities. During the week that had passed a lot of names had been mentioned and a lot of people had received official callers, and as a result the glare had pretty well concentrated on six spots. So the papers had it, and so I gathered from Purley Stebbins. What gave the scene in our office that Tuesday afternoon its special angle of interest was the fact that five of the six spots were there seated on chairs, and apparently what they wanted Wolfe to do was to take the glare out of their eyes and get it aimed exclusively at the sixth spot, not present.

'Permit me to say," Frank Broadyke offered in a cultivated baritone, "that Mr. Pohl has put it badly. The situation is this, Mr. Wolfe, that Mr. Pohl got us together and we found that each of us feels that he is being harassed unreasonably. Not only that he is unjustly suspected of a crime he did not commit, but that in a full week the police have accomplished nothing and aren't likely to, and we will be left with this unjust suspicion permanently upon us."
Broadyke gestured with a hand. More than his baritone was cultivated; he was cultivated all over. He was somewhat younger than Pohl, and ten times as elegant. His manner gave the impression that he was finding it difficult just to be himself because (a) he was in the office of a private detective, which was vulgar, (b) he had come there with persons with whom one doesn't ordinarily associate, which was embarrassing, and (c) the subject for discussion was his connection with a murder, which was preposterous. He was going on. "Mr. Pohl suggested that we consult you and engage your services. As one who will gladly pay my share of the bill, permit me to say that what I want is the removal of that unjust suspicion. If you can achieve that only by finding the criminal and evidence against him, very well. If the guilty man proves to be Victor Talbott, again very well."
"There's no if about it!" Pohl blurted. "Talbott did it, and the job is to pin it on him!"

"A man named Donaldson, and I'm wondering about him. I have a hunch
Miss Keyes is starting a little investigation on her own. Do you happen to know if this Donaldson is a detective?"
"I know he isn't. He's a lawyer and a friend of Mr. Keyes. I've seen him here several times. Do you - "
What interrupted her was a man coming in the door and heading for us.
It was a man I had known for years. "We're busy," I told him brusquely. "Come back tomorrow."
==> I should have had sense enough to give up kidding Sergeant Purley Stebbins of the Homicide Squad long ago, since it always glanced off and rolled away. When he got sore, as he often did, it wasn't at the kidding but at what he considered my interference with the performance of his duty. <==
"So you're here," he stated. "Yep. Miss Rooney, this is Sergeant - "
"Oh, I've met him before." Her face was just as sour at him as it had been at me.
"Yeah, we've met," Purley acquiesced. His honest brown eyes were at her. "I've been looking for you, Miss Rooney."

"Do you want to change it now?" Audrey frowned. "Change what?" "Your statement."
"Of course not. Why should I?"
"Then how do you account for the fact that you were seen riding a horse
into the park during that period, and Safford, on another horse, was with you, and Safford has admitted it?"
"Count ten," I snapped at her, "before you answer. Or even a hun - "

Audrey had left her perch on the desk to get on her feet and face the pursuer. "Maybe," she suggested, "someone couldn't see straight. Who says he saw us?"
"Okay." Purley hauled a paper from his pocket and unfolded it. He looked at me. "We're careful about these little details when that fat boss of yours has got his nose in." He held the paper so Audrey could see it. "This is a warrant for your arrest as a material witness. Your friend Safford wanted to read his clear through. Do you?"
She ignored his generous offer. "What does it mean?" she demanded.

I sat a little while with my lips screwed up, gazing at the ashtray on the desk. I shook my head at nothing in particular, just the state of things, reached for the phone, got an outside line, and dialed again.
Wolfe's voice answered.
"Where's Orrie?" I demanded. "Taking a nap on my bed?" "Where are you?" Wolfe inquired placidly.
"Still in Keyes' office. More of the same. Two more gone." "Two more what? Where?"

"Mr. Pohl?"
No answer.
"I must have a commitment on this, Mr. Pohl. If it proves to be Mr.
Talbott you can pay extra. But in any case, I am hired to get facts?" "Sure, the real facts."
"There is no other kind. I guarantee not to deliver any unreal facts." Wolfe leaned forward to press a button on his desk. "That is, indeed, the only guaranty I can give you. I should make it plain that you are responsible both collectively and individually for this engagement with me. Now if - "

"Fritz," Wolfe told him, "there will be five guests at dinner."
"Yes, sir," Fritz told him without a blink and turned to go. That's how good Fritz is, and he is not the kind to ring in omelets or canned soup. As he was opening the door a protest came from Frank Broadyke.
"Better make it four. I'll have to leave soon and I have a dinner engagement."
"Cancel it," Wolfe snapped.
"I'm afraid I can't, really."

this thing already a week old?" He glanced at the clock on the wall. "I'll need you, all of you, certainly all evening, and probably most of the night. I must know all that you know about Mr. Keyes and Mr. Talbott. Also, if I am to remove this unjust suspicion of you from the minds of the police and the public, I must begin by removing it from my own mind. That will take many hours of hard work."

"I'll have to phone," Broadyke muttered.
"You may," Wolfe conceded, as if he were yielding a point. His eyes
moved, left and right and left again, and settled on Audrey Rooney, whose chair was a little in the rear, to one side of Wayne Safford's. "Miss Rooney," he shot at her, "you seem to be the most vulnerable, since you were on the scene. When did Mr. Keyes dismiss you from his employ, and what for?"
Audrey had been sitting straight and still, with her lips tight. "Well, it was - " she began, but stopped to clear her throat and then didn't continue because of an interruption.
==> The doorbell had rung, and I had left it to Fritz to answer it, which was the custom when I was engaged with Wolfe and visitors, unless superseding orders had been given. Now the door to the hall opened, and Fritz entered, closed the door behind him, and announced. "A gentleman to see you, sir. Mr. Victor Talbott." <==
The name plopped in the middle of us like a paratrooper at a picnic. "By God!" Wayne Safford exclaimed.
"How the devil - " Frank Broadyke started, and stopped.
"So you told him!" Pohl spat at Dorothy Keyes.
Dorothy merely raised her brows. I was getting fed up with that routine and wished she would try something else.
Audrey Rooney's mouth was hanging open. "Show him in," Wolfe told Fritz.

Like millions of my fellow citizens, I had done some sizing up of Victor Talbott from pictures of him in the papers, and within ten seconds after he had joined us in the office I had decided the label I had tied on him could stay. He was the guy who, at a cocktail party or before dinner, grabs the tray of appetizers and passes it around, looking into eyes and making cracks. Not counting me, he was easily the best-looking male in the room.
Entering, he shot a glance and a smile at Dorothy Keyes, ignored the others, came to a stop in front of Wolfe's desk, and said pleasantly, "You're Nero Wolfe, of course. I'm Vic Talbott. I suppose you'd rather not shake hands with me under the circumstances - that is, if you're accepting the job these people came to offer you. Are you?"
"How do you do, sir," Wolfe rumbled. "Good heavens, I've shaken hands

Pohl snorted sarcastically.
"Nice honest people, Ferdy," Talbott told him, and answered Wolfe, "I
didn't."
"No? You're not here?"
"Sure I'm here, but not to join any gathering. I came to join Miss Keyes. I don't regard it as trouble to join Miss Keyes. As for the rest of them, except maybe Broadyke - "
==> The doorbell rang again, and since additional gatecrashers might or might not be desirable, I upped myself in a hurry, stepped across and into the hall, intercepted Fritz just in time, and went to the front door to take a look through the panel of one-way glass. Seeing who it was out on the stoop, I fastened the <==

 chain bolt, pulled the door open the two inches the Chain would permit, and spoke through the crack. "I don't want to catch cold."
"Neither do I," a gruff voice told me. "Take that damn bolt off." "Mr. Wolfe is engaged," I said politely. "Will I do?"
"You will not. You never have and you never will."
"Then hold it a minute. I'll see."

"Yeah. What do you want?"
"I'm sorry I was busy last evening. It's always a pleasure to see you. I've been engaged in the matter of Mr. Keyes' death, and it will be to our mutual interest for you to let me have a little routine information."
"Like what?"
"To begin with, the name and number of the mounted policeman who saw Mr. Keyes in the park at ten minutes past seven that morning. I want to send Archie - "
"Go to hell." The connection went.
==> Wolfe hung up, reached for the beer tray which Fritz had brought in, and told me, "Get Mr. Skinner of the District Attorney's office." <==
I did so, and Wolfe got on again. In the past Skinner had had his share of moments of irritation with Wolfe, but at least he hadn't had the door slammed in his face the preceding evening and therefore was not boorish. When he learned that Wolfe was on the Keyes case he wanted to know plenty, but Wolfe stiff- armed him without being too rude and soon had what he was after. Upon Wolfe's assurance that he would keep Skinner posted on developments at his end, which they both knew was a barefaced lie, the Assistant D.A. even offered to ask headquarters to arrange for me to see the cop. And did so. In less than ten minutes after Wolfe and he were finished, a call came from Centre Street to tell me that Officer Hefferan would meet me at 11:45 at the corner of Sixty-sixth Street and Central Park West.
During the less than ten minutes, Wolfe had drunk beer, asked Saul about his family, and told me what I was expected to find out from the cop. That made me sore, but even more it made me curious. When we're on a case it sometimes happens that Wolfe gets the notion that I have got involved on some angle or with some member of the cast, and that therefore it is necessary to switch me temporarily onto a siding. I had about given up wasting nervous energy resenting it. But what was it this time? I had bought nobody's version and was absolutely fancy free, so why should he send me out to chew the rag with a cop and keep Saul and Orrie for more important errands? It was beyond me, and I was glaring at him and about to open up, when the phone rang again.
It was Ferdinand Pohl, asking for Wolfe. I was going to keep out of it, since the main attack was to be entrusted to others, but Wolfe motioned me to stay on.
"I'm at the Keyes office," Pohl said, "Forty-seventh and Madison. Can you come up here right away?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 37669    window = 37664 37674


"Nothing, thank you."
I glared at him. "Oh, Saul and Orrie are doing it?"


"There's nothing for this evening, for you. I'll be here, attending to matters."
==> Yes, he would. He would be here, reading books, drinking beer, and having Fritz tell anyone who called that he was engaged. It wasn't the first time he had decided that a case wasn't worth the effort and to hell with it. On such occasions my mission was to keep after him until I had him jarred loose, but this time my position was that if Orrie Cather could spend the afternoon in my chair he could damn well do my work. So I let it lay and went up to my room to redecorate for the evening out. <==
It was a very nice evening on all counts. Dinner at Lily Rowan's, while not up to the standard Fritz had got my palate trained to, was always good. So was the show, and so was the dance band at the Flamingo Club, where we went afterward to get better acquainted, since I had only known her seven years. What with this and that I didn't get home until after three o'clock, and, following routine, looked in at the office to jiggle the handle of the safe and glance around. If there was a message for me Wolfe always left it on my desk under a paperweight, and there one was, on a sheet from his pad, in his small thin handwriting that was as easy to read as type.
I ran through it.

g: Your work on the Keyes case has been quite satisfactory. Now that it is solved, you may proceed as arranged and go to Mr. Hewitt's place on Long Island in the morning to get those plants. Theodore will have the cartons ready for you. Don't forget to watch the ventilation.

I read it through again and turned it over to look at the back, to see if there was another installment, but it was blank.

I glared at him. "Oh, Saul and Orrie are doing it?"


"There's nothing for this evening, for you. I'll be here, attending to matters."
Yes, he would. He would be here, reading books, drinking beer, and having Fritz tell anyone who called that he was engaged. It wasn't the first time he had decided that a case wasn't worth the effort and to hell with it. On such occasions my mission was to keep after him until I had him jarred loose, but this time my position was that if Orrie Cather could spend the afternoon in my chair he could damn well do my work. So I let it lay and went up to my room to redecorate for the evening out.
==> It was a very nice evening on all counts. Dinner at Lily Rowan's, while not up to the standard Fritz had got my palate trained to, was always good. So was the show, and so was the dance band at the Flamingo Club, where we went afterward to get better acquainted, since I had only known her seven years. What with this and that I didn't get home until after three o'clock, and, following routine, looked in at the office to jiggle the handle of the safe and glance around. If there was a message for me Wolfe always left it on my desk under a paperweight, and there one was, on a sheet from his pad, in his small thin handwriting that was as easy to read as type. <==
I ran through it.

g: Your work on the Keyes case has been quite satisfactory. Now that it is solved, you may proceed as arranged and go to Mr. Hewitt's place on Long Island in the morning to get those plants. Theodore will have the cartons ready for you. Don't forget to watch the ventilation.

Cramer uttered a word that was for men only. "You and your goddam charades," he said bitterly. "Why do you bother with me? You know damn well I'm not going to let you slip it to the D.A.'s office, because you may really have it. You have before. Okay. On your terms."
Wolfe nodded. The gleam in his eye came and went so fast that it nearly escaped even me.
"Your notebook, Archie. This is rather elaborate, and I doubt if we can finish before dinner."

"I'll explain gladly," I told Officer Hefferan, "if you'll descend from that horse and get level with me. That's the democratic way to do it. Do you want me to get a stiff neck, slanting up at you?"
==> I yawned wide without covering it, since there was nothing there but nature and a mounted cop. Being up and dressed and breakfasted and outdoors working at seven in the morning was not an all-time record for me, but it was unusual, and I had been up late three nights in a row: Tuesday the congregation of clients, Wednesday the festivities with Lily Rowan, and Thursday the drive to La Guardia to meet the airplane, which had been on schedule. <==
Hefferan came off his high horse and was even with me. We were posted on top of the little knoll in Central Park to which he had led me the day I had made his acquaintance. It promised to be another warm October day. A little breeze was having fun with the leaves on the trees and bushes, and birds were darting and hopping around, discussing their plans for the morning.
"All I'm doing," Hefferan said to make it plain, "is obeying orders. I was told to meet you here and listen to you."
I nodded. "And you don't care for it. Neither do I, you stiff-backed Cossack, but I've got orders too. The setup is like this. As you know, down there behind that forest" - I pointed - "is a tool shed. Outside the shed Keyes' chestnut

 horse, saddled and bridled, is being held by one of your colleagues. Inside the shed there are two women named Keyes and Rooney, and four men named Pohl, Talbott, Safford, and Broadyke. Also Inspector Cramer is there with a detachment from his squad. One of the six civilians, chosen by secret ballot, is at this moment changing his or her clothes, putting on bright yellow breeches and a blue jacket, just like the outfit Keyes wore. Between you and me and your horse, the choosing was a put-up job, handled by Inspector Cramer. Dressed like Keyes, the chosen one is going to mount Keyes' horse and ride along that stretch of the bridle path, with shoulders hunched and stirrups too long, catch sight of you, and lift his or her crop to you in greeting. Your part is to be an honest man. Pretend it's not me telling you this, but someone you dearly love like the Police Commissioner. You are asked to remember that what you were interested in seeing was the horse, not the rider, and to put the question to yourself, did you actually recognize Keyes that morning, or just the horse and the getup?"
