But by the time I had reached the door I had changed my mind. Not because of him. He looked perfectly normal - big and burly, round red face with bushy gray eyebrows, broad heavy shoulders straining the sleeve seams of his coat. It was the carton. It was a used one, the right size, the cord around it was the kind McLeod used, and the NERO WOLFE on it in blue crayon was McLeod’s style of printing. Having switched the stoop light on, I could observe those details as I approached, so I swung the door open and asked politely, "Where did you get the corn?"
==> I suppose I should explain a little. Usually Wolfe comes closest to being human after dinner, when we leave the dining room to cross the hall to the office, and he gets his bulk deposited in his favorite chair behind his desk, and Fritz brings coffee; and either Wolfe opens his current book or, if I have no date and am staying in, he starts a conversation. The topic may be anything from women’s shoes to the importance of the new moon in Babylonian astrology. But that evening he had taken his cup and crossed to the big globe over by the bookshelves and stood twirling the globe, scowling at it, probably picking a place he would rather be. <==
For the corn hadn’t come. By an arrangement with a farmer named Duncan McLeod up in Putman County, every Tuesday from July 20 to October 5, sixteen ears of just-picked corn were delivered. They were roasted in the husk, and we did our own shucking as we ate - four ears for me, eight for Wolfe, and four in the kitchen for Fritz. The corn had to arrive no earlier than five-thirty and no later than six-thirty. That day it hadn’t arrived at all, and Fritz had had to do some stuffed eggplant, so Wolfe was standing scowling at the globe when the doorbell rang.


And now here was Inspector Cramer with the carton. Could it possibly be it? It was. Handing me his hat to put on the shelf, he tramped down the hall to the office, and when I entered he had put the carton on Wolfe’s desk and had his knife out to cut the cord, and Wolfe, cup in hand, was crossing to him. Cramer opened the flaps, took out an ear of corn, held it up, and said, "If you were going to have this for dinner, I guess it’s too late."
Wolfe moved to his elbow, turned the flap to see the inscription, his name, grunted, circled around the desk to his chair, and sat. "You have your effect," he said. "I am impressed. Where did you get it?"

"I’ve got some questions for you and for him, but of course you want grounds. You would. At a quarter past five, four hours ago, the dead body of a man was found in the alley back of Rusterman’s restaurant. He had been hit in the back of the head with a piece of iron pipe which was there on the ground by the body. The station wagon he had come in was alongside the receiving platform of the restaurant, and in the station wagon were nine cartons containing ears of corn." Cramer pointed. "That’s one of them, your name on it. You get one like it every Tuesday. Right?"

"I don’t know."

Wolfe frowned at it, muttered, "I thought so," put it down, stood up, reached for the carton, said, "You will help, Archie," took an ear, and started shucking it. As I got up Cramer said something but was ignored.
When we finished we had three piles, as assorted by Wolfe. Two ears were too young, six were too old, and eight were just right. He returned to his chair, looked at Cramer, and declared, "This is preposterous."

"My wife. I haven’t got a Fritz." "Does she cook it in water?" "Sure. Is yours cooked in beer?"
"No. Millions of American women, and some men, commit that outrage every summer day. They are turning a superb treat into mere provender. Shucked and boiled in water, sweet corn is edible and nutritious; roasted in the husk in the hottest possible oven for forty minutes, shucked at the table, and buttered and salted, nothing else, it is ambrosia. No chef’s ingenuity and imagination have ever created a finer dish. American women should themselves be boiled in water. Ideally the corn - "
"How much longer are you going to stall?"


==> "I’m not stalling. Ideally the corn should go straight from the stalk to the oven, but of course that’s impractical for city dwellers. If it’s picked at the right stage of development it is still a treat for the palate after twenty-four hours, or even forty-eight; I have tried it. But look at this." Wolfe pointed to the assorted piles. "This is preposterous. Mr. McLeod knows better. The first year I had him send two dozen ears, and I returned those that were not acceptable. He knows what I require, and he knows how to choose it without opening the husk. He is supposed to be equally meticulous with the supply for the restaurant, but I doubt if he is; they take fifteen to twenty dozen. Are they serving what they got today?" <==
"Yes. They’ve admitted that they took it from the station wagon even before they reported the body." Cramer’s chin was down, and his eyes were narrowed under the eyebrow hedge. "You’re the boss at that restaurant."
Wolfe shook his head. "Not the boss. My trusteeship, under the will of my friend Marko Vukcic when he died, will end next year. You know the arrangement; you investigated the murder; you may remember that I brought the murderer back from Yugoslavia."
"Yeah. Maybe I never thanked you." Cramer’s eyes came to me. "You go there fairly often - not to Yugoslavia, to Rusterman’s. How often?"
I raised one brow. That annoys him because he can’t do it. "Oh, once a week, sometimes twice. I have privileges, and it’s the best restaurant in New York."

"No."
"Where were you at five-fifteen this afternoon?"
"In the Heron sedan which Mr. Wolfe owns and I drive. Five-fifteen? Grand Concourse, headed for the East River Drive."
"Who was with you?" "Saul Panzer."

==> He grunted. "You and Wolfe are the only two men alive Panzer would lie for. Where had you been?" <==
"Ball game. Yankee Stadium."
"What happened in the ninth inning?" He flipped a hand. "To hell with it. You’d know all right, you’d see to that. How well do you know Max Maslow?"
I raised the brow again. "Connect it, please."
"I’m investigating a murder."
"So I gathered. And apparently I’m a suspect. Connect it."

How well do you know him?"
"Not well at all. I call him Carl, but you know how that is. We have been fellow weekend guests at Miss Rowan’s place in the country a couple of times. I have seen him only when I have been with Miss Rowan."
"Do you know why his name would be in Faber’s notebook with a checkmark?" "I don’t know and I couldn’t guess."
"Do you want me to connect Susan McLeod before I ask you about her?"
==> I had supposed that would be coming as soon as I heard the name Carl Heydt, since the cops had had the notebook for four hours and had certainly lost no time making contacts. Saving me for the last, and Cramer himself coming, was of course a compliment, but more for Wolfe than for me. <==
"No, thanks," I told him. "I’ll do the connecting. The first time Kenneth Faber came with the corn, six weeks ago today, the first time I ever saw him, he told me Sue McLeod had got her father to give him a job on the farm. He was very chatty. He said he was a freelance cartoonist, and the cartoon business was in a slump, and he wanted some sun and air and his muscles needed exercise, and Sue often spent weekends at the farm and that would be nice. You can’t beat that for a connection. Go ahead and ask me about Susan McLeod."
Cramer was eying me. "You’re never slow, are you, Goodwin?"
I gave him a grin. "Slow as cold honey. But I try hard to keep up." "Don’t overdo. How long have you been intimate with her?" "Well. There are several definitions for ‘intimate.’ Which one?" "You know damn well which one."
My shoulders went up. "If you won’t say, I’ll have to guess." The shoulders went down. "If you mean the very worst, or the very best, depending on how you look at it, nothing doing. I have known her three years, having met her when she brought the corn one day. Have you seen her?"
"Yes."

"No."
"Then I give her a mark. You were at her about a murder, and she didn’t want to drag in Miss Rowan. One day, the second summer she was bringing the corn, two years ago, she said she wanted a job in New York and asked if I could get her one. I doubted if she could hold a job any friend of mine might have open or might make room for, so I consulted Miss Rowan, and she took it on. She got two girls she knew to share their apartment with Sue - it’s only five blocks from here, not six - she paid for a course at the Midtown Studio - Sue has paid her back - and she got Carl Heydt to give Sue a tryout at modeling. I understand that Sue is now one of the ten most popular models in New York and her price is a hundred dollars an hour, but that’s hearsay. I haven’t seen her on a magazine cover. I didn’t get her a job or a place to live. I know Miss Rowan better than Sue does; she won’t mind my dragging her in. Anything else?"
"Plenty. When and how did you find out that Kenneth Faber had shoved you out and taken Sue over?"


==> "Nuts." I turned to Wolfe. "Your Honor, I object to the question on the ground that it is insulting, impertinent, and disgusticulous. It assumes not only that I am shovable but also that I can be shoved out of a place I have never been." <==
"Objection sustained." A corner of Wolfe’s mouth was up a little. "You will rephrase the question, Mr. Cramer."
"The hell I will." Cramer’s eyes kept at me. "You might as well open up, Goodwin. We have a signed statement from her. What passed between you and Faber when he was here a week ago today?"
"The corn. It passed from him to me."
"So you’re a clown. I already know that. A real wit. What else?"
"Well, let’s see." I screwed my lips, concentrating. "The bell rang and I went and opened the door and said, quote, ‘Greetings. How’s things on the farm?’ As he handed me the carton he said, ‘Lousy, thank you, hot as hell and I’ve got blisters.’ As I took it I said, ‘What’s a few blisters if you’re the backbone of the country?’ He said, ‘Go soak your head,’ and went, and I shut the door and took the carton to the kitchen."

"Now listen." I turned a palm up. "I can throw sliders in a pinch, and do, but this is no pinch. It’s close to bedtime. If I don’t check with something in Sue McLeod’s statement, of course you want to work on me before I can get in touch with her, so go ahead, here I am."
"The minute’s up. Come on."
I stayed put. "No. I now have a right to be sore, so I am. You’ll have to make it good."

You think I won’t?" At least I had him glaring. "You’re under arrest as a material witness. Move!"
==> I took my time getting up. "You have no warrant, but I don’t want to be fussy." I turned to Wolfe. "If you want me around tomorrow, you might give Parker a ring." <==
"I shall." He swiveled. "Mr. Cramer. Knowing your considerable talents as I do, I am sometimes dumfounded by your fatuity. You were so bent on baiting Mr. Goodwin that you completely ignored the point I was at pains to make." He pointed at the piles on his desk. "Who picked that corn? Pfui!"
"That’s your point," Cramer rasped. "Mine is who killed Kenneth Faber. Move, Goodwin."
< class="sgc48" id="heading_id_52
AT TWENTY MINUTES PAST ELEVEN Wednesday morning, standing at the curb on Leonard Street with Nathaniel Parker, I said, "Of course in a way it’s a compliment. Last time the bail was a measly five hundred. Now twenty grand. That’s progress."
Parker nodded. "That’s one way of looking at it. He argued for fifty thousand, but I got it down to twenty. You know what that means. They actually - Here’s one."

==> A taxi headed in to us and stopped. When we were in and I had told the driver Eighth Avenue and 35th Street, and we were rolling, Parker resumed, leaning to me and keeping his voice down. The legal mind. Hackies are even better listeners than they are talkers, and that one could be a spy sicked on us by the district attorney. "They actually," he said, "think you may have killed that man. This is serious, Archie. I told the judge that bail in the amount that was asked would be justified only if they had enough evidence to charge you with murder, in which case you wouldn’t be bailable, and he agreed. As your counsel, I must advise you to be prepared for such a charge at any moment. I didn’t like Mandel’s attitude. By the way, Wolfe told me to send my bill to you, not him. He said this is your affair and he isn’t concerned. I’ll make it moderate." <==
I thanked him. I already knew that Assistant District Attorney Mandel, and maybe Cramer too, regarded me as a real candidate for the big one. Cramer had taken me to his place, Homicide South, and after spending half an hour on me

 had turned me over to Lieutenant Rowcliff and gone home. Rowcliff had stood me for nearly an hour - I had him stuttering in fourteen minutes, not a record - and had then sent me under convoy to the DA’s office, where Mandel had taken me on, obviously expecting to make a night of it.
Which he did, with the help of a pair of dicks from the DA’s Homicide Bureau. He had of course been phoned to by both Cramer and Rowcliff, and it was evident from the start that he didn’t merely think I was holding out on details that might be useful, to prevent either bother for myself or trouble for someone else; he had me tagged as a real prospect. Naturally I wanted to know why, so I played along. I hadn’t with Cramer because he had got me sore in front of Wolfe, and I hadn’t with Rowcliff because playing along is impossible with a double-breasted baboon, but with Mandel I could. Of course he was asking the questions, him and the dicks, but the trick is to answer them in such a way that the next question, or maybe one later on, tells you something you want to know, or at least gives you a hint. That takes practice, but I had had plenty, and it makes it simpler when one guy pecks away at you for an hour or so and then backs off, and another guy starts in and goes all over it again.
For instance, the scene of the crime - the alley and receiving platform at the rear of Rusterman’s. Since Wolfe was the trustee, there was nothing about that restaurant I wasn’t familiar with. From the side street it was only about fifteen yards along the narrow alley to the platform, and the alley ended a few feet farther on at the wall of another building. A car or small truck entering to deliver something had to back out. Knowing, as I had, that Kenneth Faber would come with the corn sometime after five o’clock, I could have walked in and hid under the platform behind a concrete post, with the weapon in my hand, and, when Faber drove in, got out, and came around to open the tailgate, he would never know what hit him. If I could have done that, who couldn’t? I would have had to know one other thing, that I couldn’t be seen from the windows of the restaurant kitchen because the glass had been painted on the inside so boys and girls couldn’t climb onto the platform to watch Leo boning a duck or Felix stirring goose blood into a Sauce Rouennaise.

In helping them get it on the record that I knew all that, I learned only that they had found no one who had seen the murderer in the alley or entering or leaving it, that Faber had probably been dead five to ten minutes when someone came from the kitchen to the platform and found the body, and that the weapon was a piece of two-inch galvanized iron pipe sixteen and five-eighths inches long,

 threaded male at one end and female at the other, old and battered. Easy to hide under a coat. Where it came from might be discovered by one man in ten hours, or by a thousand men in ten years.
Getting those details was nothing, since they would be in the morning papers, but regarding their slant on me I got some hints that the papers wouldn’t have. Hints were the best I could get, no facts to check, so I’ll just report how it looked when Parker came to spring me in the morning. They hadn’t let me see Sue’s statement, but it must have been something in it, or something she had said, or something someone else, maybe Carl Heydt or Peter Jay or Max Maslow, had said, either to her or to the cops. Or possibly something Duncan McLeod, Sue’s father, had said. That didn’t seem likely, but I included him because I saw him. When Parker and I entered the anteroom on our way out he was there on a chair in the row against the wall, dressed for town, with a necktie, his square deep- tanned face shiny with sweat. I crossed over and told him good morning, and he said it wasn’t, it was a bad morning, a day lost and no one to leave to see to things. It was no place for a talk, with people there on the chairs, but I might at least have asked him who had picked the corn if someone hadn’t come to take him inside.

I couldn’t expect to pass the buck to Wolfe, since he had never seen either Kenneth Faber or Sue McLeod, and as I mounted the seven steps to the stoop and put my key in the lock I decided not to try to.

The key wasn’t enough. The door opened two inches and stopped. The chain bolt was on. I pushed the button, and Fritz came and slipped the bolt; and his face told me something was stirring before he spoke. If you’re not onto the faces you see most of, how can you expect to tell anything from strange ones? As I crossed the sill I said, "Good morning. What’s up?"
He turned from closing the door and stared. "But Archie. You look terrible." "I feel worse. Now what?"
"A woman to see you. Miss Susan McLeod. She used to bring - "

 "Yeah. Where is she?"

"In the office."
"Where is he?"
"In the kitchen."
"Has he talked with her?" "No."
"How long has she been here?" "Half an hour."
==> "Excuse my manners. I’ve had a night." I headed for the end of the hall, the swinging door to the kitchen, pushed it open, and entered. Wolfe was at the center table with a glass of beer in his hand. He grunted. "So. Have you slept?" <==
"No."
"Have you eaten?"
I got a glass from the cupboard, went to the refrigerator and got milk, filled the glass, and took a sip. "If you could see the bacon and eggs they had brought in for me and I paid two bucks for, let alone taste it, you’d never be the same. You’d be so afraid you might be hauled in as a material witness you’d lose your nerve. They think maybe I killed Faber. For your information, I didn’t." I sipped milk. "This will hold me till lunch. I understand I have a caller. As you told Parker, this is my affair and you are not concerned. May I take her to the front room? I’m not intimate enough with her to take her up to my room." I sipped milk.
"Confound it," he growled. "How much of what you told Mr. Cramer was flummery?"
"None. All straight. But he’s on me and so is the DA, and I’ve got to find out why." I sipped milk.

I understand I have a caller. As you told Parker, this is my affair and you are not concerned. May I take her to the front room? I’m not intimate enough with her to take her up to my room." I sipped milk.
"Confound it," he growled. "How much of what you told Mr. Cramer was flummery?"
"None. All straight. But he’s on me and so is the DA, and I’ve got to find out why." I sipped milk.

He was eying me. "You will see Miss McLeod in the office." "The front room will do. It may be an hour. Two hours." "You may need the telephone. The office."
==> If I had been myself I would have given that offer a little attention, but I was somewhat pooped. So I went, taking my half a glass of milk. The door to the office was closed and, entering, I closed it again. She wasn’t in the red leather chair. Since she was there for me, not for Wolfe, Fritz had moved up one of the yellow chairs for her, but hearing the door open and seeing me she had sprung up, and by the time I had shut the door and turned she was to me, gripping my arms, her head tilted back to get my eyes. If it hadn’t been for the milk I would have used my arms for one of their basic functions, since that’s a sensible way to start a good frank talk with a girl. That being impractical, I tilted my head forward and kissed her. Not just a peck. She not only took it, she helped, and her grip on my arms tightened, and I had to keep the glass plumb by feel since I couldn’t see it. It wouldn’t have been polite for me to quit, so I left it to her. <==
She let go, backed up a step, and said, "You haven’t shaved."
I crossed to my desk, sipped milk, put the glass down, and said, "I spent the night at the district attorney’s office, and I’m tired, dirty, and sour. I could shower and shave and change in half an hour."
"You’re all right." She plumped onto the chair. "Look at me."
"I am looking at you." I sat. "You’d do fine for a before-and-after vitamin ad. The before. Did you get to bed?"
"I guess so, I don’t know." Her mouth opened to pull air in. Not a yawn, just helping her nose. "It couldn’t have been a jail because the windows didn’t have bars. They kept me until after midnight asking questions, and one of them took me home. Oh yes, I went to bed, but I didn’t sleep, but I must have, because I woke up. Archie, I don’t know what you’re going to do to me."

"Because ... I thought ... don’t you understand, Archie?" "I understand plenty, but not why you’re here."
"But don’t you see, it’s my word against yours. They told me last night that you denied that we had arranged to meet there. I wanted to ask you ... I thought you might change that, you might tell them that you denied it just because you didn’t want to be involved, that you had agreed to meet me there but you decided not to go, and they’ll have to believe you because of course you were somewhere else. Then they won’t have any reason not to believe me." She put out a hand. "Archie ... will you? Then it will be all right."
"Holy saints. You think so?"
"Of course it will. The way it is now, they think either I’m lying or you’re lying, but if you tell them - "
"Shut up!"
==> She gawked at me; then all of a sudden she broke. Her head went down, and her hands up to cover her face. Her shoulders started to tremble and then she was shaking all over. If she had sobbed or groaned or something I would have merely waited it out, but there was no sound effect at all, and that was dangerous. She might crack. I went to Wolfe’s desk and got the vase of orchids, Dendrobium nobile that day, removed the flowers and put them on my desk pad, went to her, got fingers under her chin and forced her head up, and sloshed her good. The vase holds two quarts. Her hands came down and I sloshed her again, and she squealed and grabbed for my arm. I dodged, put the vase on my desk, went to the bathroom, which is over in the corner, and came back with a towel. She was on her feet, dabbing at her front. "Here," I said, "use this." <==
She took it and wiped her face. "You didn’t have to do that," she said.
"The hell I didn’t." I got another chair and put it at a dry spot, went to my desk, and sat. "It might help if someone did it to me. Now listen. Whether you meant it or not, I am out on an extremely rickety limb. Ken did not tell me last Tuesday that you thought you were pregnant and he was responsible, he told me nothing whatever, but whether he lied to you or you’re lying to the cops and me, they think he did. They also think or suspect that you and I have been what they call intimate. They also expect you to say under oath that I agreed to meet you at the

 entrance of that alley yesterday at five o’clock, and I can’t prove I wasn’t there. There’s a man who will say he was with me somewhere else, but he’s a friend of mine and he often works with me when Mr. Wolfe needs more help, and the cops don’t have to believe him and neither would a jury. I don’t know what else the cops have or haven’t got, but any time now - "
"I didn’t lie to you, Archie." She was on the dry chair, gripping the towel. A strand of wet hair dropped over her eye, and she pushed it back. "Everything I told - "

"I didn’t lie to you, Archie." She was on the dry chair, gripping the towel. A strand of wet hair dropped over her eye, and she pushed it back. "Everything I told - "
"Skip it. Any time now, any minute, I may be hauled in on a charge of murder, and then where am I?

"But Archie, you - "
"Don’t interrupt. Either I wriggle off by selling them on you - and by the way, I haven’t asked you." I got up and went to her. "Stand up. Look at me." I extended my hands at waist level, open, palms up. "Put your hands on mine, palms down. No, don’t press, relax, just let them rest there. Damn it, relax! Right. Look at me. Did you kill Ken?"
"No."

"No."
"Again. Did you kill him?" "No, Archie!"
==> I turned and went back to my chair. She came a step forward, backed up, and sat. "That’s my private lie detector," I told her. "Not patented. Either I wriggle off by selling them on you, and it would take some wriggling, which is not my style, or I do a job that is my style - I hope. As you know, I work for Nero Wolfe. First I see him and tell him I’m taking a leave of absence - I hope a short one. Then you and I go some place where we’re sure we won’t be interrupted, and you tell me things, a lot of things, and no fudging. Where I go from there depends on what you tell me. I’ll tell you one thing now, if you - " <==
The door opened and Wolfe was there. He crossed to the corner of his desk,

 faced her, and spoke. "I’m Nero Wolfe. Will you please move to this chair?" He indicated the red leather chair by a nod, circled around his desk, and sat. He looked at me. "A job that is your style?"
Well. As I remarked when he insisted that I see her in the office, if I hadn’t been pooped I would have given that offer a little attention. If I had been myself I would have known, or at least suspected, what he intended. I suppose he and I came as close to trusting each other as any two men can, on matters of joint concern, but as he had told Parker, this was my affair, and I was discussing it with someone in his office, keeping him away from his favorite chair, and I had just told him that nothing of what I had told Cramer was flummery. So he had gone to the hole in the alcove.
I looked back at him. "I said I hope. What if I heard the panel open and steered clear?"

"Okay. Your trick. But I think she has a right to know."
"I agree." Sue had moved to the red leather chair, and he swiveled. "Miss McLeod. I eavesdropped, without Mr. Goodwin’s knowledge. I heard all that was said, and I saw. Do you wish to complain?"

"That’s silly," Sue blurted, "I’m not pregnant."
I stared. "You said Ken told you he told me ..." She nodded. "Ken would tell anybody anything." "But you thought you were?"
"Of course not. How could I? There’s only one way a girl can get pregnant, and it couldn’t have been that with me because it’s never happened."

< class="sgc48" id="heading_id_63
==> LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE, I like to kid myself that I know why I think this or do that, but sometimes it just won’t work, and that was once. I don’t mean why I believed her about not being pregnant and how she knew she couldn’t be; I do know that; it was the way she said it and the way she looked. I had known her three years. But since, if I believed her on that, I had to scrap the item I had just given Wolfe for ‘no’ on her killing Faber, why didn’t I change the odds to even money? I pass. I could cook up a case, for instance if she was straight on one thing, about not being pregnant and why not, she was probably straight on other things too, but who would buy it? It’s even possible that every man alive, of whom I am one, has a feeling down below that an unmarried girl who knows she can’t be pregnant is less apt to commit murder than one who can’t be sure. I admit that a good private detective shouldn’t have feelings down below, but have you any suggestions? <==
Since Wolfe pretends to think I could qualify on the witness stand as an expert on attractive young women, of course he turned to me and said, "Archie?" and I nodded yes. An expert shouldn’t back and fill, and as I just said, I believed her on the pregnancy issue. Wolfe grunted, told me to take my notebook, gave her a hard eye for five seconds, and started in.
An hour and ten minutes later, when Fritz came to announce lunch, I had filled most of a new notebook and Wolfe was leaning back with his eyes shut and his lips tight. It was evident that he was going to have to work. She had answered all his questions with no apparent fumbling, and it still looked very much as if either I was going to ride the bumps or she was. Or possibly both.
As she told it, she had met Ken Faber eight months ago at a party at the apartment of Peter Jay. Ken had been fast on the follow-up and four months later, in May, she had told him she would marry him some day - say in two or three years, when she was ready to give up modeling - if he had shown that he could support a family. From the notebook: "I was making over eight hundred dollars a week, ten times as much as he was, and of course if I got married I couldn’t expect to keep that up. I don’t think a married woman should model anyway because if you’re married you ought to have babies, and there’s no telling what that will do to you, and who looks after the babies?"
In June, at his request, she had got her father to give him a job on the farm, but

If that was straight, and the part about Carl Heydt and Peter Jay and Max Maslow could be checked, that made it more like ten to one that she hadn’t killed him. She couldn’t have ad-libbed it; she would have had to go there intending to kill him, or at least bruise him, since she couldn’t have just happened to have with her a piece of two-inch pipe sixteen inches long. Say twenty to one. But if she hadn’t, who had? Better than twenty to one, not some thug. There had been eighty bucks in Ken’s pockets, and why would a thug go up that alley with the piece of pipe, much less hide under the platform with it? No. It had to be someone out for Ken specifically who knew that spot, or at least knew about it, and knew he would come there, and when.

Then the next day, Monday, Carl - Carl Heydt - told me that Ken had told him the same thing, and I suspected he had told two other men, on account of things they had said, and I decided to go there Tuesday and see him. I was going to tell him he had to tell Archie and Carl it was a lie, and anybody else he had told, and if I had to I’d get a lawyer."
If that was straight, and the part about Carl Heydt and Peter Jay and Max Maslow could be checked, that made it more like ten to one that she hadn’t killed him. She couldn’t have ad-libbed it; she would have had to go there intending to kill him, or at least bruise him, since she couldn’t have just happened to have with her a piece of two-inch pipe sixteen inches long. Say twenty to one. But if she hadn’t, who had? Better than twenty to one, not some thug. There had been eighty bucks in Ken’s pockets, and why would a thug go up that alley with the piece of pipe, much less hide under the platform with it? No. It had to be someone out for Ken specifically who knew that spot, or at least knew about it, and knew he would come there, and when.
==> Of course it was possible the murderer was someone Sue had never heard of and the motive had no connection with her, but that would make it really tough, and there she was, and Wolfe got all she had - or at least everything she would turn loose of. She didn’t know how many different men she had had dates with in the twenty months she had been modeling - maybe thirty. More in the first year than recently; she had thought it would help to get jobs if she knew a lot of men, and it had, but now she turned down as many jobs as she accepted. When she said she didn’t know why so many men wanted to date her Wolfe made a face, but I <==

she really meant it. It was hard to believe that a girl with so much born come-on actually wasn’t aware of it, but I knew her, and so did my friend Lily Rowan, who is an expert on women.
She didn’t know how many of them had asked her to marry them; maybe ten; she hadn’t kept count. Of course you don’t like her; to like a girl who says things like that, you’d have to see her and hear her, and if you’re a man you wouldn’t stop to ask whether you liked her or not. I frankly admit that the fact that she couldn’t dance had saved me a lot of wear and tear.
From the time she had met Ken Faber she had let up on dates, and in recent months she had let only three other men take her places. Those three had all asked her to marry them, and they had stuck to it in spite of Ken Faber. Carl Heydt, who had given her her first modeling job, was nearly twice her age, but that wouldn’t matter if she wanted to marry him when the time came. Peter Jay, who was something important in a big advertising agency, was younger, and Max Maslow, who was a fashion photographer, was still younger.
She had told Carl Heydt that what Ken had told him wasn’t true, but she wasn’t sure that he had believed her. She couldn’t remember exactly what Peter Jay and Max Maslow had said that made her think that Ken had told them too; she hadn’t had the suspicion until Monday, when Carl had told her what Ken had told him. She had told no one that she was going to Rusterman’s Tuesday to see Ken. All three of them knew about the corn delivery to Rusterman’s and Nero Wolfe; they knew she had made the deliveries for two summers and had kidded her about it; Peter Jay had tried to get her to pose in a cornfield, in an evening gown, for a client of his. They knew Ken was working at the farm and was making the deliveries. From the notebook, Wolfe speaking: "You know those men quite well. You know their temperaments and bents. If one of them, enraged beyond endurance by Mr. Faber’s conduct, went there and killed him, which one? Remembering it was not a sudden fit of passion, it was premeditated, planned. From your knowledge of them, which one?"

Wolfe wiggled a finger at her. "That’s twaddle, Miss McLeod. You may be shocked at the notion that someone close to you is a murderer; anyone would be;

 but you may not reject it as inconceivable. By your foolish subterfuge you have made it impossible to satisfy the police that neither you nor Mr. Goodwin killed that man except by one procedure: demonstrate that someone else killed him, and identify him. I must see those three men, and, since I never leave my house on business, they must come to me. Will you get them here? At nine o’clock this evening?"

"No," she said. "I won’t."
He glared at her. If she had been merely a client, with nothing but a fee at stake, he would have told her to either do as she was told or clear out, but the stake was an errand boy it would be a calamity to lose, me, as he had admitted in my hearing. So he turned the glare off and turned a palm up. "Miss McLeod. I concede that your refusal to think ill of a friend is commendable. I concede that Mr. Faber may have been killed by someone you have never heard of with a motive you can’t even conjecture - and by the way, I haven’t asked you: do you know of anyone who might have had a ponderable reason for killing him?"
"No."

"No."
"But it’s possible that Mr. Heydt does, or Mr. Jay or Mr. Maslow. Even accepting your conclusion that none of them killed him, I must see them. I must also see your father, but separately - I’ll attend to that. My only possible path to the murderer is the motive, and one or more of those four men, who knew Mr. Faber, may start me on it. I ask you to have those three here this evening. Not you with them."
She was frowning. "But you can’t... you said identify him. How can you?" "I don’t know. Perhaps I can’t, but I must try. Nine o’clock?"
==> She didn’t want to, even after the concessions he had made, but she had to admit that we had to get some kind of information from somebody, and who else was there to start with? So she finally agreed, definitely, and Wolfe leaned back with his eyes shut and his lips tight, and Fritz came to announce lunch. Sue got up to go, and when I returned after seeing her to the door and out, Wolfe had crossed to the dining room and was at the table. Instead of joining him, I stood and said, "Ordinarily I would think I was well worth it, but right now I’m no bargain at any price. Have we a program for the afternoon?" <==

No. Except to telephone Mr. McLeod."
"I saw him at the DA’s office. Then I’m going up and rinse off before I eat. I think I smell. Tell Fritz to save me a bite in the kitchen."
I went to the hall and mounted the two flights to my room. During the forty minutes it took to do the job I kept telling my brain to lay off until it caught up, but it wouldn’t. It insisted on trying to analyze the situation, with the emphasis on Sue McLeod. If I had her figured wrong, if she was it, it would almost certainly be a waste of time to try to get anything from three guys who were absolutely hooked, and if there was no program for the afternoon I had damn well better think one up. If it would be a calamity for Wolfe to lose me for good, what would it be for me? By the time I stepped into the shower the brain had it doped that the main point was the piece of pipe. She had not gone into that alley toting that pipe; that was out. But I hadn’t got that point settled conclusively by Cramer or Mandel, and I hadn’t seen a morning paper. I would consult the Times when I went downstairs. But the brain wanted to know now, and when I left the shower I dried in a hurry, went to the phone on the bedtable, dialed the Gazette, got Lon Cohen, and asked him. Of course he knew I had spent the night downtown and he wanted a page or two of facts, but I told him I was naked and would catch cold, and how final was it that whoever had conked Faber had brought the pipe with him? Sewed up, Lon said. Positively. The pipe was at the laboratory, revealing - maybe - its past to the scientists, and three or four dicks with color photos of it were trying to pick up its trail. I thanked him and promised him something for a headline if and when. So that was settled. As I went to a drawer for clean shorts the brain started in on Carl Heydt, but it had darned little to work on, and by the time I tied my tie it was buzzing around trying to find a place to land.
Downstairs, Wolfe was still in the dining room, but I went on by to the kitchen, got at my breakfast table with the Times, and was served by Fritz with what do you think? Corn fritters. There had been eight perfectly good ears, and Fritz hates to throw good food away. With bacon and homemade blackberry jam they were ambrosia, and in the Times report on the Faber murder Wolfe’s name was mentioned twice and mine four times, so it was a fine meal. I had finished the eighth fritter and was deciding whether to take on another one and a third cup of coffee when the doorbell rang, and I got up and went to the hall for a look. Wolfe was back in the office, and I stuck my head in and said, "McLeod."

He let out a growl. True, he had told Sue he must see her father and was even going to phone to ask him to come in from the country, but he always resents an unexpected visitor, no matter who. Ignoring the growl, I went to the front and opened the door, and when McLeod said he wanted to see Mr. Wolfe, with his burr on the r, I invited him in, took his Sunday hat, a dark gray antique fedora in good condition, put it on the shelf, and took him to the office. Wolfe, who is no hand-shaker, told him good afternoon and motioned to the red leather chair.
McLeod stood. "No need to sit," he said. "I’ve been told about the corn and I came to apologize. I’m to blame, and I’d like to explain how it happened. I didn’t pick it; that young man did. Kenneth Faber."
Wolfe grunted. "Wasn’t that heedless? I telephoned the restaurant this morning and was told that theirs was as bad as mine. You know what we require."

Sewed up, Lon said. Positively. The pipe was at the laboratory, revealing - maybe - its past to the scientists, and three or four dicks with color photos of it were trying to pick up its trail. I thanked him and promised him something for a headline if and when. So that was settled. As I went to a drawer for clean shorts the brain started in on Carl Heydt, but it had darned little to work on, and by the time I tied my tie it was buzzing around trying to find a place to land.
Downstairs, Wolfe was still in the dining room, but I went on by to the kitchen, got at my breakfast table with the Times, and was served by Fritz with what do you think? Corn fritters. There had been eight perfectly good ears, and Fritz hates to throw good food away. With bacon and homemade blackberry jam they were ambrosia, and in the Times report on the Faber murder Wolfe’s name was mentioned twice and mine four times, so it was a fine meal. I had finished the eighth fritter and was deciding whether to take on another one and a third cup of coffee when the doorbell rang, and I got up and went to the hall for a look. Wolfe was back in the office, and I stuck my head in and said, "McLeod."

He let out a growl. True, he had told Sue he must see her father and was even going to phone to ask him to come in from the country, but he always resents an unexpected visitor, no matter who. Ignoring the growl, I went to the front and opened the door, and when McLeod said he wanted to see Mr. Wolfe, with his burr on the r, I invited him in, took his Sunday hat, a dark gray antique fedora in good condition, put it on the shelf, and took him to the office. Wolfe, who is no hand-shaker, told him good afternoon and motioned to the red leather chair.
McLeod stood. "No need to sit," he said. "I’ve been told about the corn and I came to apologize. I’m to blame, and I’d like to explain how it happened. I didn’t pick it; that young man did. Kenneth Faber."
==> Wolfe grunted. "Wasn’t that heedless? I telephoned the restaurant this morning and was told that theirs was as bad as mine. You know what we require." <==
He nodded. "I ought to by now. You pay a good price, and I want to say it’ll never happen again. I’d like to explain it. A man was coming Thursday with a bulldozer to work on a lot I’m clearing, but Monday night he told me he’d have to come Wednesday instead, and I had to dynamite a lot of stumps and rock before he came. I got at it by daylight yesterday and I thought I could finish in time to pick the corn, but I had some trouble and I had to leave the corn to that young man. I had showed him and I thought he knew. So I’ve got to apologize and I’ll see it don’t happen again. Of course I’m not expecting you to pay for it."
Wolfe grunted. "I’ll pay for the eight ears we used. It was vexatious, Mr. McLeod."
"I know it was." He turned and aimed his gray-blue eyes, with their farmer’s squint, at me. "Since I’m here I’m going to ask you. What did that young man tell you about my daughter?"
I met his eyes. It was a matter not only of murder, but also of my personal jam that might land me in the jug any minute, and all I really knew of him was that he was Sue’s father and he knew how to pick corn. "Not a lot," I said. "Where did you get the idea he told me anything about her?"
"From her. This morning. What he told her he told you. So I’m asking you, to get it straight."

"No need to sit. I just want to know what that young man said about my daughter."
"She has told you what he said he said. She has also told Mr. Goodwin and me. We have spoken with her at length. She came shortly after eleven o’clock this morning to see Mr. Goodwin and stayed two hours."
"My daughter Susan? Came here?" "Yes."

==> McLeod moved. In no hurry, he went to the red leather chair, sat, focused on Wolfe, and demanded, "What did she come for?" <==
Wolfe shook his head. "You have it wrong side up. That tone is for us, not you. We may or may not oblige you later; that will depend. The young man you permitted to pick my corn has been murdered, and because of false statements made by your daughter to the police Mr. Goodwin may be charged with murder. The danger is great and imminent. You say you spent yesterday dynamiting stumps and rocks. Until what hour?"
McLeod’s set jaw made his deep-tanned seamed face even squarer. "My daughter doesn’t make false statements," he said. "What were they?"
"They were about Mr. Goodwin. Anyone will lie when the alternative is intolerable. She may have been impelled by a desperate need to save herself, but Mr. Goodwin and I do not believe she killed that man. Archie?"
I nodded. "Right. Now any odds you want to name." "And we’re going to learn who did kill him. Did you?" "No. But I would have, if ..." He let it hang.
"If what?"

"If I had known what he was saying about my daughter. I told them that, the police. I heard about it from them, and from my daughter, last night and this morning. He was a bad man, an evil man. You say you’re going to learn who killed him, but I hope you don’t. I told them that too. They asked me what you

"Who was helping you with the stumps?"
"Nobody, not in the afternoon. He was with me all morning after he did the chores, but then he had to pick the corn and then he had to go with it."
"You have no other help?" "No."
"Other children? A wife?"
"My wife died ten years ago. We only had Susan. I told you, I don’t resent this, not a bit. I said I would have killed him if I’d known. I didn’t want her to come to New York, I knew something like this might happen - the kind of people she got to know and all the pictures of her. I’m an old-fashioned man and I’m a righteous man, only that word righteous may not mean for you what it means for me. You said you might oblige me later. What did my daughter come here for?"
==> "I don’t know." Wolfe’s eyes were narrowed at him. "Ask her. Her avowed purpose is open to question. This is futile, Mr. McLeod, since you think a righteous man may wink at murder. I wanted - " <==
"I didn’t say that. I don’t wink at murder. But I don’t have to want whoever killed Kenneth Faber to get caught and suffer for it. Do I?"
"No. I wanted to see you. I wanted to ask you, for instance, if you know a man named Carl Heydt, but since - "
"I don’t know him. I’ve never seen him. I’ve heard his name from my daughter; he was the first one she worked for. What about him?"
"Nothing, since you don’t know him. Do you know Max Maslow?" "No."
"Peter Jay?"

"No. I’ve heard their names from my daughter. She tells me about people; she tries to tell me they’re not as bad as I think they are, only their ideas are different from mine. Now this has happened, and I knew it would, something like this. I don’t wink at murder and I don’t wink at anything sinful."
"But if you knew who killed that man or had reason to suspect anyone you wouldn’t tell me - or the police."
"I would not."
"Then I won’t keep you. Good afternoon, sir."
McLeod stayed put. "If you won’t tell me what my daughter came here for I can’t make you. But you can’t tell me she made false statements and not say what they were."
==> Wolfe grunted. "I can and do. I will tell you nothing." He slapped the desk. "Confound it, after sending me inedible corn you presume to come and make demands on me? Go!" <==
McLeod’s mouth opened and closed again. In no hurry, he got up. "I don’t think it’s fair," he said. "I don’t think it’s right." He turned to go and turned back. "Of course you won’t be wanting any more corn."
Wolfe was scowling at him. "Why not? It’s only the middle of September." "I mean not from me."
"Then from whom? Mr. Goodwin can’t go scouring the countryside with this imbroglio on our hands. I want corn this week. Tomorrow?"
"I don’t see... There’s nobody to bring it."
"Friday, then?"

I had my nose fill the order for more oxygen, swiveled, and said brightly, "That was a big help. Now we know about the corn."
Wolfe straightened up. "Pfui. Call Felix and tell him to expect a delivery on Friday."
"Yes, sir. Good. Then everything’s jake."
"That’s bad slang. There is good slang and bad slang. How long will it take you to type a full report of our conversation with Miss McLeod, yours and mine, from the beginning?"

"The last half, more than half, is in the notebook. For the first part I’ll have to dig, and though my memory is as good as you think it is, that will be a little slower. Altogether, say four hours. But what’s the idea? Do you want it to remember me by?"
"No. Two carbons."

I got up and went to the kitchen for a glass of milk. I might or might not start on it before four o’clock, when he would go up to the plant rooms for his afternoon session with the orchids.
< class="sgc48" id="heading_id_74
==> AT FIVE MINUTES PAST NINE that evening the three men whose names had had checkmarks in front of them in Kenneth Faber’s little notebook were in the office, waiting for Wolfe to show. They hadn’t come together; Carl Heydt had arrived first, ten minutes early, then Peter Jay, on the dot at nine, and then Max Maslow. I had put Heydt in the red leather chair, and Jay and Maslow on two of the yellow ones facing Wolfe’s desk. Nearest me was Maslow. <==
I had seen Heydt before, of course, but you take a new look at a man when he becomes a homicide candidate. He looked the same as ever - medium height with a slight bulge in the middle, round face with a wide mouth, quick dark eyes that kept on the move. Peter Jay, the something important in the big advertising agency, tall as me but not as broad, with more than his share of chin and a thick dark mane that needed a comb, looked as if he had the regulation ulcer, but it could have been just the current difficulty. Max Maslow, the fashion photographer, was a surprise. With the twisted smile he must have practiced in front of a mirror, the trick haircut, the string tie dangling, and the jacket with four buttons buttoned, he was a screwball if I ever saw one, and I wouldn’t have supposed that Sue McLeod would let such a specimen hang on. I admit it could have been just that his ideas were different from mine, but I like mine.
Wolfe came. When there is to be a gathering he stays in the kitchen until I buzz on the house phone, and then he doesn’t enter, he makes an entrance. Nothing showy, but it’s an entrance. A line from the door to the corner of his desk just misses the red leather chair, so with Heydt in the chair he would have had to circle around his feet and also pass between Heydt and the other two; and he detoured to his right, between the chair and the wall, to his side of the desk, stood, and shot me a glance. I pronounced their names, indicating who was which, and he gave them a nod, sat, moved his eyes from left to right and back again, and spoke.
"This can be fairly brief," he said, "or it can go on for hours. I think, gentlemen, you would prefer brevity, and so would I. I assume you have all been questioned by the police and by the district attorney or one of his assistants?"

Heydt and Maslow nodded, and Jay said yes. Maslow had his twisted smile on.

"Then you’re on record, but I’m not privy to that record. Since you came here to oblige Miss McLeod, you should know our position, Mr. Goodwin’s and mine, regarding her. She is not our client; we are under no commitment to her; we are acting solely in our own interest. But as it now stands we are satisfied that she didn’t kill Kenneth Faber."
"That’s damn nice of you," Maslow said. "So am I." "Your own interest?" Jay asked. "What’s your interest?"

"We’re reserving that. We don’t know how candid Miss McLeod has been with you, any or all of you, or how devious. I will say only that, because of statements made to the police by Miss McLeod, Mr. Goodwin is under heavy suspicion, and that because she knew the suspicion was unfounded she agreed to ask you gentlemen to come to see me. To lift the suspicion from Mr. Goodwin we must find out where it belongs, and for that we need your help."
"My God," Heydt blurted. "I don’t know where it belongs."
The other two looked at him, and he looked back. There had been a feel in the atmosphere and the looks made it more than a feel. Evidently each of them had ideas about the other two, but of course it wasn’t as simple as that if one of them had killed Faber, since he would be faking it. Anyhow, they all had ideas and they were itching.
==> "Quite possibly," Wolfe conceded, "none of you knows. But it is not mere conjecture that one of you has good reason to know. All of you knew he would be there that day at that hour, and you could have gone there at some previous time to reconnoiter. All of you had an adequate motive - adequate, at least, for the one it moved: Mr. Faber had either debased or grossly slandered the woman you wanted to marry. All of you had some special significance in his private thoughts or plans; your names were in his notebook, with checkmarks. You are not targets chosen at random for want of better ones; you are plainly marked by circumstances. Do you dispute that?" <==
Maslow said, "All right, that’s our bad luck." Heydt, biting his lip, said nothing. Jay said, "It’s no news that we’re targets. Go on from there."
Wolfe nodded. "That’s the rub. The police have questioned you, but I doubt if

 they have been importunate; they have been set at Mr. Goodwin by Miss McLeod. I don’t know - "
"That’s your interest," Jay said. "To get Goodwin from under." "Certainly. I said so. I - "

If they’re on him they have a damn good reason. Also permit me to say I hope he does get from under, but not by making me the goat. I’m no hero."
Wolfe shook his head. "As I said, I’m reserving what Miss McLeod has told the police. She may tell you if you ask her. As for you gentlemen, I don’t know how curious the police have been about you. Have they tried seriously to find someone who saw one of you in that neighborhood Tuesday afternoon? Of course they have asked you where you were that afternoon, that’s mere routine, but have they properly checked your accounts? Are you under surveillance? I doubt it; and I haven’t the resources for those procedures. I invite you to eliminate yourselves from consideration if you can. The man who killed Kenneth Faber was in that alley, concealed under that platform, shortly after five o’clock yesterday afternoon. Mr. Heydt. Can you furnish incontestable evidence that you weren’t there?"

Wolfe nodded. "That’s the rub. The police have questioned you, but I doubt if

 they have been importunate; they have been set at Mr. Goodwin by Miss McLeod. I don’t know - "
"That’s your interest," Jay said. "To get Goodwin from under." "Certainly. I said so. I - "

Heydt cleared his throat. "If I could, I don’t have to furnish it to you. It seems to me - oh, what the hell. No, I can’t."
"Mr. Jay?"
"Incontestable, no." Jay leaned forward, his chin out. "I came here because Miss McLeod asked me to, but if I understand what you’re after I might as well go. You intend to find out who killed Faber and pin it on him. To prove it wasn’t Archie Goodwin. Is that it?"
"Yes."
"Then count me out. I don’t want Goodwin to get it, but neither do I want

 anyone else to. Not even Max Maslow."
==> "That’s damn nice of you, Pete," Maslow said. "A real pal." Wolfe turned to him. "You, sir. Can you eliminate yourself?" <==
"Not by proving I wasn’t there." Maslow flipped a hand. "I must say, Wolfe, I’m surprised at you. I thought you were very tough and cagey, but you’ve swallowed something. You said we all wanted to marry Miss McLeod. Who fed you that? I admit I do, and as far as I know Carl Heydt does, but not my pal Pete. He’s the pay-as-you-go type. I wouldn’t exactly call him a Casanova, because Casanova never tried to score by talking up marriage, and that’s Pete’s favorite gambit. I could name - "
"Stand up." It was his pal Pete, on his feet, with fists, glaring down at him. Maslow tilted his head back. "I wouldn’t, Pete. I was merely - "
"Stand up or I’ll slap you out of the chair."
Of course I had plenty of time to get there and in between them, but I was curious. It was likely that Jay, not caring about his knuckles, would go for the jaw, and I wanted to see what effect it would have on the twisted smile. My curiosity didn’t get satisfied. As Maslow came up out of the chair he sidestepped, and Jay had to turn, hauling his right back. He started it for Maslow’s jaw by the longest route, and Maslow ducked, came on in, and landed with his right at the very best spot for a bare fist. A beautiful kidney punch. As Jay started to bend Maslow delivered another one to the same spot, harder, and Jay went down. He didn’t tumble, he just wilted. By then I was there. Maslow went to his chair, sat, breathed, and fingered his string tie. The smile was intact, maybe twisted a little more. He spoke to Wolfe. "I hope you didn’t misunderstand me. I wasn’t suggesting that I think he killed Faber. Even if he did I wouldn’t want him to get it. On that point we’re pals. I was only saying I don’t see how you got your reputation if you - You all right, Pete?"
I was helping Jay up. A kidney punch doesn’t daze you, it just makes you sick. I asked him if he wanted a bathroom, and he shook his head, and I steered him to his chair. He turned his face to Maslow, muttered a couple of extremely vulgar words, and belched.

Wolfe turned. "Mr. Heydt. The others have made it clear that if they have information that would help to expose the murderer they won’t divulge it. How about you?"
Heydt cleared his throat. "I’m glad I don’t have to answer that," he said. "I don’t have to answer it because I have no information that would help. I know Archie Goodwin and I might say we’re friends. If he’s really in a jam I would want to help if I could.

"You’re bluffing," Maslow said. "I call." He got up and headed for the hall. I got up and followed him out, got his hat from the shelf, and opened the front door; and as I closed it behind him and started back down the hall here came the other two. I opened the door again, and Jay, who had no hat, went by and on out, but Heydt stood there. I got his hat and he took it and put it on. "Look, Archie," he said. "You’ve got to do something."

He grunted. "Have you finished it?" "Yes. Twelve pages."
"May I see it?"
Not an order, a request. At least he was remembering that it was a joint affair. I opened a drawer, got the original, and took it to him. He inspected the heading

 and the first page, flipped through the sheets, took a look at the end, dropped it on his desk, and said, "Your notebook, please." I sat and got my notebook and pen.
==> "There will be two," he said, "one for you and one for me. First mine. Heading in caps, affidavit by Nero Wolfe. The usual State of New York, County of New York. The text: I hereby depose that the twelve foregoing typewritten pages attached hereto, comma, each page initialed by me, comma, are a full and accurate record of a conversation that took place in my office on October thirteenth, nineteen sixty-one, by Susan McLeod, comma, Archie Goodwin, comma, and myself, semicolon; that nothing of consequence has been omitted or added in this typewritten record, semicolon; and that the conversation was wholly impromptu, comma, with no prior preparation or arrangement. A space for my signature, and below, the conventional formula for notarizing. The one for you, on the same sheet if there is room, will be the same with the appropriate changes." <==
I looked up. "All right, it wasn’t just to keep me off your neck. Okay on the power. But there’s still the if on the preference. She didn’t kill him. She came to me and opened the bag. I’m her hero. She as good as told Maslow that she’d marry me if I asked her. Maybe she could learn how to dance if she tried hard, though I admit that’s doubtful. She makes a lot more than you pay me, and we could postpone the babies. You said you doubt if she would be convicted, but that’s not good enough. Before I sign that affidavit I would need to know that you won’t chuck the joint affair as soon as the heat is off of me."
"Rrrhhh," he said.
"I agree," I said, "it’s a goddam nuisance. It’s entirely her fault, she dragged me in without even telling me, and if a girl pushes a man in a hole he has a right to wiggle out, but you must remember that I am now a hero. Heroes don’t wiggle. Will you say that it will be our joint affair to make sure that she doesn’t go to trial?"
"I wouldn’t say that I will make sure of anything whatever." "Correction. That you will be concerned?"
He took air in, all the way, through his nose, and let it out through his mouth. "Very well. I’ll be concerned." He glanced at the twelve pages on his desk. "Will

 you bring Miss Pinelli to my room at five minutes to nine in the morning?"
"No. She doesn’t get to her office until nine-thirty."
"Then bring her to the plant rooms at nine-forty with the affidavit." He looked at the wall clock. "You can type it in the morning. You’ve had no sleep for forty hours. Go to bed."
That was quite a compliment, and I was appreciating it as I mounted the stairs to my room. Except for a real emergency he will permit no interruptions from nine to eleven in the morning, when he is in the plant rooms, but he wasn’t going to wait until he came down to the office to get the affidavit notarized. As I got into bed and turned the light off I was considering whether to ask for a raise now or wait till the end of the year, but before I made up my mind I didn’t have a mind. It was gone.
I never did actually make up my mind about passing the buck to Sue. I was still on the fence after breakfast Thursday morning, when I dialed the number of Lila Pinelli, who adds maybe two bucks a week to the take of her secretarial service in a building on Eighth Avenue by doubling as a notary public. Doing the affidavits didn’t commit me to anything; the question was, what then? So I asked her to come, and she came, and I took her up to the plant rooms. She was in a hurry to get back, but she had never seen the orchids, and no one alive could just breeze on by those benches, with everything from the neat little Oncidiums to the big show-offs like the Laeliocattleyas. So it was after ten o’clock when we came back down and I paid her and let her out, and I went to the office and put the document in the safe.
==> As I say, I never did actually make up my mind; it just happened. At ten minutes past eleven Wolfe, having come down at eleven as usual, was at his desk looking over the morning crop of mail, and I was at mine sorting the germination slips he had brought, when the doorbell rang. I stepped to the hall for a look, turned, and said, "Cramer. I’ll go hide in the cellar." <==
"Confound it," he growled. "I wanted - Very well." "There’s no law about answering doorbells."
"No. We’ll see."

I went to the front, opened up, said good morning, and gave him room. He crossed the sill, took a folded paper from a pocket, and handed it to me. I unfolded it, and a glance was enough, but I read it through. "At least my name’s spelled right," I said. I extended my hands, the wrists together. "Okay, do it right. You never know."
"You’d clown in the chair," he said. "I want to see Wolfe." He marched down the hall and into the office. Very careless. I could have scooted on out and away, and for half a second I considered it, but I wouldn’t have been there to see the look on his face when he found I was gone. When I entered the office he was lowering his fanny onto the red leather chair and putting his hat on the stand beside it. Also he was speaking. "I have just handed Goodwin a warrant for his arrest," he was saying, "and this time he’d stay."

When I entered the office he was lowering his fanny onto the red leather chair and putting his hat on the stand beside it. Also he was speaking. "I have just handed Goodwin a warrant for his arrest," he was saying, "and this time he’d stay." <==
I stood. "It’s an honor," I said. "Anyone can be banged by a bull or a dick. It takes me to be pinched by an inspector, and twice in one week."
His eyes stayed at Wolfe. "I came myself," he said, "because I want to tell you how it stands. A police officer with a warrant to serve is not only allowed to use his discretion, he’s supposed to. I know damn well what Goodwin will do, he’ll clam up, and a crowbar wouldn’t pry him open. Give me that warrant, Goodwin."
"It’s mine. You’ve served it."
"I have not. I just showed it to you." He stretched an arm and took it. "When I was here Tuesday night," he told Wolfe, "you were dumfounded by my fatuity. So you said in your fancy way. All you cared about was who picked that corn. I came myself to see how you feel now. Goodwin will talk if you tell him to. Do you want me to wait in the front room while you discuss it? Not all day, say ten minutes. I’m giving you a - "
He stopped to glare. Wolfe had pushed his chair back and was rising, and of course Cramer thought he was walking out. It wouldn’t have been the first time. But Wolfe headed for the safe, not the hall. As he turned the handle and pulled the door open, there I was. If he had told me to bring it instead of going for it himself, I could have stalled while I made up my mind, even with Cramer there, but as I have said twice before I never did actually make up my mind. I merely went to my desk and sat. I owed Sue McLeod nothing. If either she or I was going to be cooped, there were two good reasons why it should be her: she had

"No. We’ll see."

I went to the front, opened up, said good morning, and gave him room. He crossed the sill, took a folded paper from a pocket, and handed it to me. I unfolded it, and a glance was enough, but I read it through. "At least my name’s spelled right," I said. I extended my hands, the wrists together. "Okay, do it right. You never know."

Over the years I have made a large assortment of cracks about Inspector Cramer, but I admit he has his points.

Altogether, more than half an hour; and not once did he ask a question or even look up. And when he finished, even then no questions. Lieutenant Rowcliff or Sergeant Purley Stebbins would have kept at us for an hour. Cramer merely gave each of us a five-second straight hard look, folded the document and put it in his inside breast pocket, rose and came to my desk, picked up the phone, and dialed. In a moment he spoke.
"Donovan? Inspector Cramer. Give me Sergeant Stebbins." In another moment: "Purley? Get Susan McLeod. Don’t call her, get her. Go yourself. I’ll be there in ten minutes and I want her there fast. Take a man along. If she balks, wrap her up and carry her."

OF ALL THE THOUSAND or more times I have felt like putting vinegar in Wolfe’s beer, I believe the closest I ever came to doing it was that Thursday evening when the doorbell rang at a quarter past nine, and after a look at the front I told him that Carl Heydt, Max Maslow, and Peter Jay were on the stoop, and he said they were not to be admitted.

In the nine and a half hours that had passed since Cramer had used my phone to call Purley Stebbins I had let it lie. I couldn’t expect Wolfe to start any fur flying until there was a reaction, or there wasn’t, say by tomorrow noon, to what had happened to Sue. However, I had made a move on my own. When Wolfe had left the office at four o’clock to go up to the plant rooms, I had told him I would be out on an errand for an hour or so, and I had taken a walk, to Rusterman’s, thinking I might pick up some little hint.
I didn’t. First I went out back for a look at the platform and the alley, which might seem screwy, since two days and nights had passed and the city scientists

 had combed it, but you never know. I once got an idea just running my eye around a hotel room where a woman had spent a night six months earlier. But I got nothing from the platform or alley except a scraped ear from squeezing under the platform and out again, and after talking with Felix and Joe and some of the kitchen staff I crossed it off. No one had seen or heard anyone or anything until Zoltan had stepped out for a cigarette (no smoking is allowed in the kitchen) and had seen the station wagon and the body on the ground.
I would have let it ride that evening, no needling until tomorrow noon. When Lily Rowan phoned around seven o’clock and said Sue had phoned her from the DA’s office that she was under arrest and had to have a lawyer and would Lily send her one, and Lily wanted me to come and tell her what was what, I would have gone if I hadn’t wanted to be on hand if there was a development. But when the development came Wolfe told me not to let it in.

I straight-eyed him. "You said you’d be concerned."
"I am concerned."
"Then here they are. You tossed her to the wolves to open them up, and here - "
"No. I did that to keep you out of jail. I am considering how to deal with the problem, and until I decide there is no point in seeing them. Tell them they’ll hear from us."
The doorbell rang again. "Then I’ll see them. In the front room." "No. Not in my house." He went back to his book.

==> Either put vinegar in his beer or get the Marley .32 from my desk drawer and shoot him dead, but that would have to wait; they were on the stoop. I went and opened the door enough for me to slip through, did so, bumping into Carl Heydt, and pulled the door shut. "Good evening," I said. "Mr. Wolfe is busy on an important matter and can’t be disturbed. Do you want to disturb me instead?" <==
They all spoke at once. The general idea seemed to be that I would open the door and they would handle the disturbing.
"You don’t seem to realize," I told them, "that you’re up against a genius. So am I, only I’m used to it. You were damn fools to think he was bluffing. You might have known he would do exactly what he said."


"Then he did?" Peter Jay. "He did it?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 73654    window = 73649 73659


"Then he did?" Peter Jay. "He did it?"
"We did. I share the glory. We did."
"Glory hell." Max Maslow. "You know Sue didn’t kill Ken Faber. He said so."
"He said we were satisfied that she didn’t. We still are. He also said that we doubt if she’ll be convicted. He also said that our interest was to get me from under, and we had alternatives. We could either find out who killed Faber, for which we needed your help; or, if you refused to help, we could switch it to Sue. You refused, and we switched it, and I am in the clear, and here you are. Why? Why should he waste time on you now? He is busy on an important matter; he’s reading a book entitled My Life in Court, by Louis Nizer. Why should he put it down for you?"
"I can’t believe it, Archie." Carl Heydt had hold of my arm. "I can’t believe you’d do a thing like this - to Sue - when you say she didn’t - "
==> "You never can tell, Carl. There was that woman who went to the park every day to feed the pigeons, but she fed her husband arsenic. I have a suggestion. This is Mr. Wolfe’s house and he doesn’t want you in it, but if you guys have changed your minds, at least two of you, about helping to find out who killed Faber, I’m a licensed detective too and I could spare a couple of hours. We can sit here on the steps, or we can go somewhere - " <==
"And you can tell us," Maslow said, "what Sue told the cops that got them on you. I may believe that when I hear it."
"You won’t hear it from me. That’s not the idea. You tell me things. I ask questions and you answer them. If I don’t ask them, who will? I doubt if the cops or the DA will; they’ve got too good a line on Sue. I’ll tell you this much, they know she was there Tuesday at the right time, and they know that she lied to them about what she was there for and what she saw. I can spare an hour or two."
They exchanged glances, and they were not the glances of buddies with a common interest. They also exchanged words and found they agreed on one point: if one of them took me up they all would. Peter Jay said we could go to his place and they agreed on that too, and we descended to the sidewalk and

 headed east. At Eighth Avenue we flagged a taxi with room for four. It was ten minutes to ten when it rolled to the curb at a marquee on Park Avenue in the Seventies.

ydt shook his head. "No, thanks. I’ll watch." "Okay. It’ll be simpler if you just relax, Goodwin."
I couldn’t turn and go, leaving my rear open. "I hope you won’t tickle," I said, backing up a step.
"Come in behind, Pete," Maslow said, and started, slow, his elbows out a little and his open hands extended and up some. Since he had been so neat with the kidney punch he probably knew a few tricks, maybe the armpit or the apple, and with Jay on my back I would have been a setup, so I doubled up and whirled, came up bumping Jay, and gave him the edge of my hand, as sharp as I could make it, on the side of his neck, the tendon below the ear. It got exactly the right spot and so much for him, but Maslow had my left wrist and was getting his shoulder in for the lock, and in another tenth of a second I would have been meat. The only way to go was down, and I went, sliding off his shoulder and bending my elbow into his belly, and he made a mistake. Having lost the lock, he reached for my other wrist. That opened him up, and I rolled into him, brought my right arm around, and had his neck with a knee in his back.
"Do you want to hear it crack?" I asked him, which was bad manners, since he couldn’t answer. I loosened my arm a little. "I admit I was lucky. If Jay had been sideways you would have had me." I looked at Jay, who was on a chair, rubbing his neck. "If you want to play games you ought to take lessons. Maslow would be a good teacher." I unwound my arm and got erect. "Don’t bother to see me out," I said and headed for the front.
I was still breathing a little fast when I emerged to the sidewalk, having straightened my tie and run my comb through my hair in the elevator. My watch said twenty past ten. Also in the elevator I had decided to make a phone call, so I walked to Madison Avenue, found a booth, and dialed one of the numbers I knew best. Miss Lily Rowan was in and would be pleased to have me come and tell her things, and I walked the twelve blocks to the number on 63rd Street where her penthouse occupies the roof.
==> Since it wasn’t one of Wolfe’s cases with a client involved, but a joint affair, and since it was Lily who had started Sue on her way at my request, I gave her the whole picture. Her chief reactions were a) that she didn’t blame Sue and I had no right to, I should feel flattered; b) that I had to somehow get Sue out of it without involving whoever had removed such a louse as Kenneth Faber from circulation; <==

 and c) that if I did have to involve him she hoped to heaven it wasn’t Carl Heydt because there was no one else around who could make clothes that were fit to wear, especially suits. She had sent a lawyer to Sue, Bernard Ross, and he had seen her and had phoned an hour before I came to report that she was being held without bail and he would decide in the morning whether to apply for a writ.
It was after one o’clock when I climbed out of a cab in front of the old brownstone on West 35th Street, mounted the stoop, used my key, went down the hall to the office and switched the light on, and got a surprise. Under a paperweight on my desk was a note in Wolfe’s handwriting. It said:
AG: Saul will take the car in the morning, probably for most of the day. His car is not presently available. NW
I went to the safe, manipulated the knob, opened the door, got the petty-cash book from the drawer, flipped to the current page, and saw an entry:

"Do you want to hear it crack?" I asked him, which was bad manners, since he couldn’t answer. I loosened my arm a little. "I admit I was lucky. If Jay had been sideways you would have had me." I looked at Jay, who was on a chair, rubbing his neck. "If you want to play games you ought to take lessons. Maslow would be a good teacher." I unwound my arm and got erect. "Don’t bother to see me out," I said and headed for the front.

I put it back, shut the door, twirled the knob, and considered Wolfe had summoned Saul, and he had come and had been given an errand for which he needed a car. What errand, for God’s sake? Not to drive to Putman County to get the corn that had been ordered for Friday; for that he wouldn’t need to start in the morning, he wouldn’t need a hundred bucks for possible expenses, and the entry wouldn’t say "exp AG." It shouldn’t say that anyway since I wasn’t a paying client; it should say "exp JA" for joint affair. And if we were going to split the outlay I should damn well have been consulted beforehand.

I was at my desk, looking through the evening edition of the Gazette that had just been delivered, when I heard a noise I couldn’t believe. The elevator. I looked at my watch: half past five. That was unprecedented. He never did that. Once in the plant rooms he stuck there for the two hours, no matter what. If he had a notion that couldn’t wait he buzzed me on the house phone, or Fritz if I wasn’t there. I dropped the paper and got up and stepped to the hall. The elevator jolted to a stop at the bottom, the door opened, and he emerged.
"The corn," he said. "Has it come?"
For Pete’s sake. Being finicky about grub is all right up to a point, but there’s a limit. "No," I said. "Unless Saul brought it."
He grunted. "A possibility occurred to me. When it comes - if it comes - no. I’ll see for myself. The possibility is remote, but it would be - "
"Here it is," I said. "Good timing." A man with a carton had appeared on the stoop. As I started to the front the door bell rang, and as I opened the door Wolfe was there beside me. The man, a skinny little guy in pants too big for him and a bright green shirt, spoke. "Nero Wolfe?"

Nor would I report on last night or this morning unless and until he asked for it. Back in the office after lunch, he got settled in his favorite chair with My Life in Court, and I brought a file of cards from the cabinet and got busy with the germination records. At one minute to four he put his book down and went to keep his date with the orchids. It would have been a pleasure to take the Marley .32 from the drawer and plug him in the back.
I was at my desk, looking through the evening edition of the Gazette that had just been delivered, when I heard a noise I couldn’t believe. The elevator. I looked at my watch: half past five. That was unprecedented. He never did that. Once in the plant rooms he stuck there for the two hours, no matter what. If he had a notion that couldn’t wait he buzzed me on the house phone, or Fritz if I wasn’t there. I dropped the paper and got up and stepped to the hall. The elevator jolted to a stop at the bottom, the door opened, and he emerged.
"The corn," he said. "Has it come?"
For Pete’s sake. Being finicky about grub is all right up to a point, but there’s a limit. "No," I said. "Unless Saul brought it."
He grunted. "A possibility occurred to me. When it comes - if it comes - no. I’ll see for myself. The possibility is remote, but it would be - "
==> "Here it is," I said. "Good timing." A man with a carton had appeared on the stoop. As I started to the front the door bell rang, and as I opened the door Wolfe was there beside me. The man, a skinny little guy in pants too big for him and a bright green shirt, spoke. "Nero Wolfe?" <==
"I’m Nero Wolfe." He was on the sill. "You have my corn?" "Right here." He put the carton down and let go of the cord.

May I have your name, sir?"
"My name’s Palmer. Delbert Palmer. Why?"
"I like to know the names of men who render me a service. Did you pick the corn?"

"Hell, no. McLeod picked it." "Did you pack it in the carton?"

"My name’s Palmer. Delbert Palmer. Why?"
"I like to know the names of men who render me a service. Did you pick the corn?"
"Hell, no. McLeod picked it." "Did you pack it in the carton?"
"No, he did. Look here, I know you’re a detective. You just ask questions from habit, huh?"
==> "No, Mr. Palmer. I merely want to be sure about the corn. I’m obliged to you. Good day, sir." He bent over to slip his fingers under the cord, lifted the carton, and headed for the office. Palmer told me distinctly, "It takes all kinds," turned, and started down the steps, and I shut the door. In the office, Wolfe was standing eying the carton, which he had put on the seat of the red leather chair. As I crossed over he said without looking up, "Get Mr. Cramer." <==
It’s nice to have a man around who obeys orders no matter how batty they are and saves the questions for later. That time the questions got answered before they were asked. I went to my desk, dialed Homicide South, and got Cramer, and Wolfe, who had gone to his chair, took his phone.
"Mr. Cramer? I must ask a favor. I have here in my office a carton which has just been delivered to me. It is supposed to contain corn, and perhaps it does, but it is conceivable that it contains dynamite and a contraption that will detonate it when the cord is cut and the flaps raised. My suspicion may be groundless, but I have it. I know this is not your department, but you will know how to proceed. Will you please notify the proper person without delay? ... That can wait until we know what’s in the carton... Certainly. Even if it contains only corn I’ll give you all relevant information... No, there is no ticking sound. If it does contain explosives there is almost certainly no danger until the carton is opened... Yes, I’ll make sure."
He hung up, swiveled, and glared at the carton. "Confound it," he growled, "again. We’ll get some somewhere before the season ends."

==> THE FIRST CITY EMPLOYEE to arrive, four or five minutes after Wolfe hung up, was one in uniform. Wolfe was telling me what Saul’s errand had been when the doorbell rang, and since I resented the interruption I trotted to the front, opened the door, saw a prowl car at the curb, and demanded rudely, "Well?" <==
"Where’s that carton?" he demanded back.
"Where it will stay until someone comes who knows something." I was shutting the door but his foot was there.
"You’re Archie Goodwin," he said. "I know about you. I’m coming in. Did you yell for help or didn’t you?"
He had a point. An officer of the law doesn’t have to bring a search warrant to enter a house whose owner has asked the police to come and get a carton of maybe dynamite. I gave him room to enter, shut the door, took him to the office, pointed to the carton, and said, "If you touch it and it goes off we can sue you for damages."
"You couldn’t pay me to touch it," he said. "I’m here to see that nobody does." He glanced around, went over by the big globe, and stood, a good fifteen feet away from the carton. With him there, the rest of the explanation of Saul’s errand had to wait, but I had something to look at to pass the time - a carbon copy, one sheet, which Wolfe had taken from his desk drawer and handed me, of something Saul had typed on my machine during my absence Thursday evening.

The second city employee to arrive, at ten minutes to six, was Inspector Cramer. When the bell rang and I went to let him in the look on his face was one I had seen before. He knew Wolfe had something fancy by the tail, and he would have given a month’s pay before taxes to know what. He tramped to the office, saw the carton, turned to the cop, got a salute but didn’t acknowledge it, and said, "You can go, Schwab."
"Yes, sir. Stay out front?" "No. You won’t be needed."
Fully as rude as I had been, but he was a superior officer. Schwab saluted again and went. Cramer looked at the red leather chair. He always sat there, but the

 carton was on it. I moved up one of the yellow ones, and he sat, took his hat off and dropped it on the floor, and asked Wolfe, "What is this, a gag?"

I missed the rest because the doorbell rang and I went. It was the bomb squad, two of them. They were in uniform, but one look and you knew they weren’t flatties - if nothing else, their eyes. When I opened the door I saw another one down on the sidewalk, and their special bus, with its made-to-order enclosed body, was double-parked in front. I asked, "Bomb squad?" and the shorter one said, "Right," and I convoyed them to the office. Cramer, on his feet, returned their salute, pointed to the carton, and said, "It may be just corn. I mean the kind of corn you eat. Or it may not. Nero Wolfe thinks not. He also thinks it’s safe until the flaps are opened, but you’re the experts. As soon as you know, phone me here.

The other one, the taller one, had stooped to press his ear against the carton and kept it there.

I said, "The man who brought it carried it by the cord," and got ignored. They went, the one with the carton in front, and I followed to the stoop, watched them put it in the bus, and

 returned to the office. Cramer was in the red leather chair, and Wolfe was speaking.

"My God, you can lie."
Wolfe tapped the desk with a fingertip. "Mr. Cramer. If you insist on lies you’ll get them. Until I know what’s in that carton. Then we’ll see." He picked up his book, opened to his place, and swiveled to get the light right.
Cramer was stuck. He looked at me, started to say something, and vetoed it. He couldn’t get up and go because he had told the Bomb Squad to call him there, but an inspector couldn’t just sit. He took a cigar from a pocket, looked at it, put it back, arose, came to me, and said, "I’ve got some calls to make." Meaning he wanted my chair, which was a good dodge since it got some action; I had to move. He stayed at the phone nearly half an hour, making four or five calls, none of which sounded important, then got up and went over to the big globe and started studying geography. Ten minutes was enough for that, and he switched to the bookshelves. Back at my desk, leaning back with my legs crossed, my hands clasped behind my head, I noted which books he took out and looked at. Now that I knew who had killed Ken Faber, little things like that were interesting. The one he looked at longest was The Coming Fury, by Bruce Carton. He was still at that when the phone rang. I turned to get it, but by the time I had it to my ear he was there. A man asked for Inspector Cramer and I handed it to him and permitted myself a grin as I saw Wolfe put his book down and reach for his phone. He wasn’t going to take hearsay, even from an inspector.
It was a short conversation; Cramer’s end of it wasn’t more than twenty words. He hung up and went to the red leather chair. "Okay," he growled. "If you had opened that carton they wouldn’t have found all the pieces. You didn’t think it was dynamite, you knew it was. Talk."

Wolfe, his lips tight, was breathing deep. "Not me," he said. "It would have been Archie or Fritz, or both of them. And of course my house. The possibility occurred to me, and I came down, barely in time. Three minutes later ... Pfui.

 That man is a blackguard." He shook his head, as if getting rid of a fly. "Well. Shortly after ten o’clock last evening I decided how to proceed, and I sent for Saul Panzer. When he came - "

Ten minutes was enough for that, and he switched to the bookshelves. Back at my desk, leaning back with my legs crossed, my hands clasped behind my head, I noted which books he took out and looked at. Now that I knew who had killed Ken Faber, little things like that were interesting. The one he looked at longest was The Coming Fury, by Bruce Carton. He was still at that when the phone rang. I turned to get it, but by the time I had it to my ear he was there. A man asked for Inspector Cramer and I handed it to him and permitted myself a grin as I saw Wolfe put his book down and reach for his phone. He wasn’t going to take hearsay, even from an inspector. <==
It was a short conversation; Cramer’s end of it wasn’t more than twenty words. He hung up and went to the red leather chair. "Okay," he growled. "If you had opened that carton they wouldn’t have found all the pieces. You didn’t think it was dynamite, you knew it was. Talk."
Wolfe, his lips tight, was breathing deep. "Not me," he said. "It would have been Archie or Fritz, or both of them. And of course my house. The possibility occurred to me, and I came down, barely in time. Three minutes later ... Pfui.

 That man is a blackguard." He shook his head, as if getting rid of a fly. "Well. Shortly after ten o’clock last evening I decided how to proceed, and I sent for Saul Panzer. When he came - "
"Who put that dynamite in that carton?"

"... But if you insist, very well. My reason for thinking it may contain an explosive is that it was brought by a stranger. My name printed on it was as usual, but naturally such a detail would not be overlooked. There are a number of people in the metropolitan area who have reason to wish me ill, and it would be imprudent - "
"My God, you can lie."
Wolfe tapped the desk with a fingertip. "Mr. Cramer. If you insist on lies you’ll get them. Until I know what’s in that carton. Then we’ll see." He picked up his book, opened to his place, and swiveled to get the light right.
Cramer was stuck. He looked at me, started to say something, and vetoed it. He couldn’t get up and go because he had told the Bomb Squad to call him there, but an inspector couldn’t just sit. He took a cigar from a pocket, looked at it, put it back, arose, came to me, and said, "I’ve got some calls to make." Meaning he wanted my chair, which was a good dodge since it got some action; I had to move. He stayed at the phone nearly half an hour, making four or five calls, none of which sounded important, then got up and went over to the big globe and started studying geography.

"Who put that dynamite in that carton?"
"I’m telling you. When he came I had him type something on a sheet of paper and told him to drive to Duncan McLeod’s farm this morning and give it to Mr. McLeod. Archie. You have the copy."
I took it from my pocket and went and handed it to Cramer. He kept it, but this is what it said:

2. Where did you go when you drove away from your farm Tuesday afternoon around two o’clock - perhaps a little later - and returned around seven o’clock, late for milking?
3. Where did you get the piece of pipe? Was it on your premises?
4. Do you know that your daughter saw you leaving the alley Tuesday afternoon? Did you see her?
5. Is it true that the man with the bulldozer told you Monday night that he would have to come Wednesday instead of Thursday?
There are many questions you may be asked; these are only samples. If competent investigators are moved to start inquiries of this nature, you will of course be in a difficult position, and it would be well to anticipate it.
==> Cramer looked up and aimed beady eyes at Wolfe. "You knew last night that McLeod killed Faber." <==
"Not certain knowledge. A reasoned conclusion."


"You knew he left his farm Tuesday afternoon. You knew his daughter saw him at the alley. You knew - "
"No. Those were conclusions." Wolfe turned a palm up. "Mr. Cramer. You sat there yesterday morning and read a document sworn to by Mr. Goodwin and me. When you finished it you knew everything that I knew, and I have learned nothing since then. From the knowledge we shared I had concluded that McLeod had killed Faber. You haven’t. Shall I detail it?"

"Yes."
"First, the corn. I presume McLeod told you, as he did me, that he had Faber pick the corn because he had to dynamite some stumps and rocks."
"Yes."
"That seemed to me unlikely. He knows how extremely particular I am, and also the restaurant. We pay him well, more than well; it must be a substantial portion of his income. He knew that young man couldn’t possibly do that job. It must have been something more urgent than stumps and rocks that led him to risk losing such desirable customers. Second, the pipe. It was chiefly on account of the pipe that I wanted to see Mr. Heydt, Mr. Maslow, and Mr. Jay. Any man - "
"When did you see them?"

"No. Those details were merely corroborative. The conclusive item came from Miss McLeod. You read that document. I asked her - I’ll quote it from memory. I said to her, ‘You know those men quite well. You know their temperaments. If one of them, enraged beyond endurance by Mr. Faber’s conduct, went there and killed him, which one? It wasn’t a sudden fit of passion, it was premeditated and planned. From your knowledge of them, which one?’ How did she answer me?"

 "She said, ‘They didn’t.’"
"Yes. Didn’t you think that significant? Of course I had the advantage of seeing and hearing her."
"Sure it was significant. It wasn’t the reaction you always get to the idea that some close friend has committed murder. It wasn’t shock. She just stated a fact. She knew they hadn’t."
==> Wolfe nodded. "Precisely. And I saw and heard her. And there was only one way she could know they hadn’t, with such certainty in her words and voice and manner: She knew who had. Did you form that conclusion?" <==
"Yes."
"Then why didn’t you go on? If she hadn’t killed him herself but knew who had, and it wasn’t one of those three men - isn’t it obvious?"
"You slipped that in, if she hadn’t killed him herself. Why hadn’t she?"
A corner of Wolfe’s mouth went up. "There it is, your one major flaw: a distorted conception of the impossible. You will reject as inconceivable such a phenomenon as a man being at two different spots simultaneously, though any adroit trickster could easily contrive it; but you consider it credible that that young woman - even after you had studied her conversation with Mr. Goodwin and me - that she concealed that piece of pipe on her person and took it there with the intention of crushing a man’s skull with it. Preposterous. That is inconceivable." He waved it away. "Of course that’s academic, now that that wretch has betrayed himself by sending me dynamite instead of corn, and the last step to my conclusion was inevitable. Since she knew who had killed Faber but wouldn’t name him, and it wasn’t one of those three, it was her father; and since she was certain - I heard and saw her say, ‘They didn’t’ - she had seen him there. I doubt if he knew it, because - but that’s immaterial. So much for - "
He stopped because Cramer was up, coming to my desk. He picked up the phone, dialed, and in a moment said, "Irwin? Inspector Cramer. I want Sergeant Stebbins." After another moment: "Purley? Get Carmel, the sheriff’s office. Ask him to get Duncan McLeod and hold him, and no mistake... Yes, Susan McLeod’s father. Send two men to Carmel and tell them to call in as soon as they arrive.

 rough... No, that can wait. I’ll be there soon - half an hour, maybe less."
He hung up, about-faced to Wolfe, and growled, "You knew all this Wednesday afternoon, two days ago."
Wolfe nodded. "And you have known it since yesterday morning. It’s a question of interpretation, not of knowledge. Will you please sit? As you know, I like eyes at my level. Thank you. Yes, as early as Wednesday afternoon, when Miss McLeod left, I was all but certain of the identity of the murderer, but I took the precaution of seeing those three men that evening because it was just possible that one of them would disclose something cogent. They didn’t. When you came yesterday morning with that warrant, I gave you that document for two reasons: to keep Mr. Goodwin out of jail, and to share my knowledge with you. I wasn’t obliged to share also my interpretation of it. Any moment since yesterday noon I have rather expected to hear that Mr. McLeod had been taken into custody, but no."

Since I had given you the facts, I thought it only fair to inform Mr. McLeod that he was menaced by a logical conclusion from those facts; and I did so.

He was unaware of the conclusion I had reached, and if I had told him there might have been disagreement regarding the course to take. He can be - uh - difficult."
Cramer grunted. "Yeah. He can. So you deliberately warned a murderer. Telling him to have answers ready. Nuts. You expected him to lam."

I resumed the potting. But conceivable. I dropped the trowel and went to the elevator, and within thirty seconds after I emerged in the hall the carton came."
"Luck," Cramer said. "Your goddam incredible luck. If it had made mincemeat of Goodwin you might have been willing to admit for once - Okay, it didn’t." He got up. "Stick around, Goodwin. They’ll want you at the DA’s office, probably in the morning." To Wolfe: "What if that phone call had said the carton held corn, just corn? You think you could have talked me off, don’t you?"

You’ll thank you. I admit it would be a job for you to get down on your knees, but - "
The phone rang. I swiveled and got it, and a voice I recognized asked for Inspector Cramer. I turned and told him, "Purley Stebbins," and he came and took it. The conversation was even shorter than the one about the carton, and Cramer’s part was only a dozen words and a couple of growls. He hung up, went and got his hat, and headed for the hall, but a step short of the door he stopped and turned.
"I might as well tell you," he said. "It’ll give you a better appetite for dinner, even if it’s not corn. About an hour ago Duncan McLeod sat or stood or lay on a pile of dynamite and it went off. They’ve got his head and some other pieces. They’ll want to decide whether it was an accident or he did it. Maybe you can help them interpret the facts."
He turned and went.

She gave me a look. "You know you don’t want to. Let’s go outside."
I said it was cold, and she said she knew it and headed for the foyer. We got her wrap, a fur thing which she probably didn’t own, since top-flight models are offered loans of everything from socks to sable, went back in, on through, and out to the terrace. There were evergreens in tubs, and we crossed to them for shelter from the wind.
"You told Lily I hate you," she said. "I don’t."
"Not ‘hate,’" I said. "She misquoted me or you’re misquoting her. She said I should dance with you and I said when I tried it a month ago you froze."
"I know I did." She put a hand on my arm. "Archie. It was hard, you know it was. If I hadn’t got my father to let him work on the farm ... it was my fault, I know it was ... but I couldn’t help thinking if you hadn’t sent him that ... letting him know you knew..."
==> "I didn’t send it, Mr. Wolfe did. But I would have. Okay, he was your father, so it was hard. But no matter whose father he was, I’m not wearing an arm band for the guy who packed dynamite in that carton." <==
"Of course not. I know. Of course not. I tell myself I’ll have to forget it ... but it’s not easy..." She shivered. "Anyway I wanted to say I don’t hate you. You don’t have to dance with me, and you know I’m not going to get married until I can stop working and have babies, and I know you never are, and even if you do it will be Lily, but you don’t have to stand there and let me really freeze, do you?"
I didn’t. You don’t have to be rude, even with a girl who can’t dance, and it was cold out there.

It is my custom to let my share wait until after I have opened Wolfe’s, looked it over, and put it on his desk, but sometimes curiosity butts in. As it did that Tuesday morning when I came to an elegant cream-colored envelope, outsize, addressed to me on a typewriter, with the return address in the corner engraved in dark brown: <==
JAMES NEVILLE VANCE
Two Nineteen Horn Street New York 12 New York
Never heard of him. It wasn’t flat; it bulged with something soft inside. Like everybody else, I occasionally get envelopes containing samples of something that bulges them, but not expensive envelopes with engraving that isn’t phony. So I slit it open and removed the contents. A folded sheet of paper that matched the envelope, including the engraved name and address, had a message typed in the center:
Archie Goodwin - Keep this until you hear from me. JNV
"This" was a necktie, a four-in-hand, neatly folded to go in the envelope. I stretched it out - long, narrow, maybe silk, light tan, almost the same color as the stationery, with thin brown diagonal lines. A Sutcliffe label, so certainly silk, say twenty bucks. But he should have sent it to the cleaners instead of me, because it had a spot, a big one two inches long, near one end, about the same tone of brown as the thin lines; but the lines’ brown was clean and live and the spot’s brown was dirty and dead. I sniffed at it, but I am not a beagle. Having seen a few dried bloodstains here and there, I knew the dirty color was right, but that’s

 no phenolphthalin test. Even so, I told myself as I dropped the tie in a drawer, supposing that James Neville Vance worked in a butcher shop and forgot his bib, why pick on me? As I closed the drawer I shrugged.
==> That’s the way to take it when you get a bloodstained (maybe) necktie in the mail from a stranger, just shrug, but I admit that in the next couple of hours I did something and didn’t do something else. What I did do was ring Lon Cohen at the Gazette to ask a question, and an hour later he called back to say that James Neville Vance, now in his late fifties, still owned all the real estate he had inherited from his father, still spent winters on the Riviera, and was still a bachelor; and what did he want of a private detective? I reserved that. What I didn’t do was take a walk. When nothing is stirring and Wolfe has given me no program I usually go out after the routine morning chores to work my legs and have a look at the town and my fellow men, not to mention women, but that morning I skipped it because JNV might come or phone. It had been an honest shrug, but you can’t shrug all day. <==
I might as well have had my walk because the phone call didn’t come until a quarter past eleven, after Wolfe had come down to the office from his two-hour morning session with the orchids up in the plant rooms on the roof. He had put a spray of Cymbidium Doris in the vase on his desk and got his personal seventh of a ton disposed in his oversize custom-made chair, and was scowling at the dust jacket of a book, one of the items that had been addressed to him, when the phone rang and I got it.
"Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie Goodwin speaking." "Is this Archie Goodwin?"
Three people out of ten will do that. I am always tempted to say no, it’s a trained dog, and see what comes next, but I might get barked at. So I said, "It is. In person."
"This is James Neville Vance. Did you receive something in the mail from me?"
His voice couldn’t decide whether to be a squeak or a falsetto and had the worst features of both. "Yes, presumably," I said. "Your envelope and letterhead."

"And an enclosure." "Right."


"Please destroy it. Burn it. I intended - But what I intended doesn’t matter now... I was mistaken. Burn it. I’m sorry to have bothered you."
He hung up.
==> I cradled the phone and swiveled. Wolfe had opened the book to the title page and was eying it with the same kind of look a man I know has for a pretty girl he has just met. <==
"If I may interrupt," I said. "Since there’s nothing urgent in the mail I have an errand, personal or professional, I don’t know which." I got the envelope, letterhead, and enclosure from the drawer, rose, and handed them to him. "If that spot on the tie is blood, my theory was that someone stabbed or shot James Neville Vance and got rid of the corpse all right but didn’t know what to do with the tie, so he sent it to me, but that phone call was a bagpipe saying he was James Neville Vance, and he had been mistaken, and I would please burn what he had sent me by mail. So evidently - "
"A bagpipe?"
"I merely meant he squeaked. So evidently he couldn’t burn it himself because he didn’t have a match, and now he’s impersonating James Neville Vance, who owns - or owned - various gobs of real estate, and it is my duty as a citizen and a licensed private detective to expose and denounce - "
"Pfui. Some floundering numskull."
"Okay. I’ll go out back to burn it. It’ll smell." He grunted. "It may not be blood."

It was a baritone, no trace of a squeak. I told the grill, "I have something that belongs to you and I want to return it."
"You have something that belongs to me?" "Right."
"What is it and where did you get it?"
"Correction. I think it belongs to you. It’s a four-in-hand silk tie, Sutcliffe label, the same color as this house, with diagonal lines the same color as the trim. Cream and brown."
"Who are you and where did you get it?"
==> I got impatient. "Here’s a suggestion," I said. "Install closed-circuit television so you can see the vestibule from up there, and phone me at the office of Nero Wolfe, where I work, and I’ll come back. It will take a week or so and set you back ten grand, but it’ll be worth it to see the tie without letting me in. After you’ve identified it I’ll tell you where I got it. If you don’t - " <==
"Did you say Nero Wolfe? The detective?"


"Yes."
"But what - This is ridiculous."

"Yes."
"But what - This is ridiculous."
"I agree. Completely. Give me a ring when you’re ready."

"Yes."
"But what - This is ridiculous."
"I agree. Completely. Give me a ring when you’re ready."
"But I - All right. Use the elevator. I’m in the studio, the top floor - four."
==> There was a click at the door, and on the third click I pushed it open and entered. To my surprise the small hall was not more cream and brown but a deep rich red with black panel-borders, and the door of the do-it-yourself elevator was stainless steel. When I pushed the button and the door opened, and, inside, pushed the 4 button and was lifted, there was practically no noise or vibration - very different from the one in the old brownstone which Wolfe always used and I never did. <==
Stepping out when the door opened, I got another surprise. Since he had called it the studio I was expecting to smell turpentine and see a clutter of vintage Vances, but at first glance it was a piano warehouse. There were three of them in the big room, which was the length and width of the house.
The man standing there waited to speak until my glance got to him. Undersized, with too much chin for his neat smooth face, no wrinkles, he wasn’t as impressive as his stationery, but his clothes were - cream-colored silk shirt and brown made-to-fit slacks. He cocked his head, nodded, and said, "I recognize you. I’ve seen you at the Flamingo." He came a step. "What’s this about a tie? Let me see it."
"It’s the one you sent me," I said.
He frowned. "The one I sent you?"
"There seems to be a gap," I said. "Are you James Neville Vance?" "I am. Certainly."

"It must be mine. I can settle that. Come along."
He headed for the rear and I followed, back beyond the second piano, and then down spiral stairs, wide for a spiral, with carpeted steps and a polished wooden rail. At the bottom, the rear end of a good-sized living room, he turned right through an open door and we were in a bedroom. He crossed to another door and opened it, and I stopped two steps off. It was a walk-in closet. A friend of mine once told me that a woman’s clothes closet will tell you more about her than any other room in the house, and if that goes for a man too there was my chance to get the lowdown on James Neville Vance, but I was interested only in his neckties. They were on a rack at the right, three rows of them, quite an assortment, some cream and brown but by no means all. He fingered through part of one row, repeated it, turned and emerged, and said, "It’s mine. I had nine and gave one to somebody, and there are only seven." He shook his head. "I can’t imagine ..." He let it hang. "What on earth ..." He let that hang too.
"And your stationery," I said.
"Yes. Of course."
"And the phone call telling me to burn it. With a squeak." "Yes. You asked if I had any ideas or suggestions. Have you?"
==> "I could have, but they would be expensive. I work for Nero Wolfe and it would be on his time, and the bill would be bad news. You must know who has access to your stationery and that closet, and you ought to be able to make some kind of a guess about who and why. And you won’t need the tie. It came to me in the mail, so actually and legally it’s in my possession, and I ought to keep it." I put a hand out. "If you don’t mind?" <==
"Of course." He handed it over. "But I might - You’re not going to burn it?"
"No indeed." I stuck it in my side pocket. The envelope and letterhead were back in my breast pocket. "I have a little collection of souvenirs. If and when you have occasion to produce it for - "
A bell tinkled somewhere, a soft music tinkle, possibly music of the future. He frowned and turned and started for the front, and I followed, back through the

 open door, and across the living room to another door, which he opened. Two men were there in a little foyer - one a square little guy in shirt sleeves and brown denim pants, and the other, also square but big, a harness bull.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 692    window = 687 697

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 73928    window = 73923 73933


"Ring before you - I’d better come." He crossed the sill and when I was out closed the door. Four of us in the elevator didn’t leave much room. When it stopped at 2 and they stepped out I stepped out too, into another small foyer. Vance pressed a button on a doorjamb, waited half a minute, pressed it again, kept his finger on it for five seconds, and waited some more. "All right, Bert," he said and moved aside. Bert put a key in the lock - a Rabson, I noticed - turned it, turned the knob, pushed the door open, and made room for Vance to enter. Then the cop, and then me. Two steps in, Vance stopped, faced the rear, and raised his baritone. "Bonny! It’s Jim!"
I saw it first, a blue slipper on its side on the floor with a foot in it, extending beyond the edge of a couch. I moved automatically but stopped short. Let the

 cop do his own discovering. He did; he saw it too and went; and when he had passed the end of the couch he stopped shorter than I had, growled, "Godalmighty," and stood looking down. Then I moved, and so did Vance. When Vance saw it, all of it, he went stiff, gawking, then he made a sort of choking noise, and then he crumpled. It wasn’t a faint; his knees just quit on him and he went down, and no wonder. Even live blood on a live face makes an impression, and when the face is dead and the blood has dried all over one side and the ear, plenty of it, you do need knees.
I don’t say I wasn’t impressed, but my problem wasn’t knees. It took me maybe six seconds to decide. Bert had joined us and was reacting. Vance had grabbed the back of the couch to pull himself up. The cop was squatting for a close-up of the dead face. No one knew if I was there or not, and in another six seconds I wasn’t. I went to the door, easy, let myself out, took the elevator down, and on out to the sidewalk. A police car was double-parked right in front, and the cop at the wheel, seeing me emerge from that house, gave me an eye but let it go at that as I headed west. Approaching Sixth Avenue, I felt sweat trickling down onto my cheek and got out my handkerchief. The sun was at the top on a warm August day, but I don’t sweat when I’m walking, and besides, why didn’t I know it before it collected enough to trickle? There you are. One man’s knees buckle immediately and another man starts sweating five minutes later and doesn’t know it.
==> It was a quarter to one when I climbed out of a taxi in front of the old brownstone on West 35th Street, mounted the seven steps of the stoop, and used my key. Before proceeding down the hall to the office I used my handkerchief thoroughly; Wolfe, who misses nothing, had never seen me sweat and wouldn’t now. When I entered he was at his desk with the new book, and he took his eyes from it barely enough for a sidewise glance at me as I crossed to my desk. I sat and said, "I don’t like to interrupt, but I have a report." <==
He grunted. "Is it necessary?"
"It’s desirable. There’s nearly half an hour till lunch, and if someone comes, for instance an officer of the law, it would be better if you knew about it."
He let the book down a little. "What the devil are you into now?"
"That’s the report. Ten minutes will do it, fifteen at the outside, even verbatim."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 73940    window = 73935 73945


I started in, verbatim, and by the time I was telling Vance he should install closed-circuit television he was leaning back with his eyes closed. Merely force of habit. When I mentioned the title of the privately printed book he made a noise - he says all music is a vestige of barbarism - and when I came to the end he snorted and opened his eyes.
"I don’t believe it," he said flatly. "You’ve omitted something. A death by violence, and, not involved and with no commitment, you left? Nonsense." He straightened up.
I nodded. "You’re not interested and you don’t intend to be, so you didn’t bother to look at it. I was present at the discovery of a dead body, obviously murdered. If I had hung around I would have been stuck. In another minute the cop would have ordered us to stay put, and he would have taken my name and recognized it. When Homicide came, probably Stebbins but no matter who, he would have learned why I was there, if not from me, then from Vance, and he would have taken the envelope and letterhead and necktie, and I wanted them for souvenirs. As I told Vance, they are actually and legally in my possession."
"Pfui."
"I disagree. Of course I would have liked to stay long enough to get a sample of that blood to have it compared with the spot on the tie. If it was the same I would be the first to know it and it’s nice to be first. Also of course, Vance will tell them about me, and the question is can I be hooked for obstructing justice if I refuse to hand over the tie? I don’t see how; There’s nothing to connect it with the homicide until and unless her blood is compared with the spot."
==> Wolfe granted. "Flummery. Provoking the police is permissible only when it serves a purpose." <==
"Certainly. And if James Neville Vance comes or calls to say that he expects to be charged with the murder of Mrs. Kirk, if that’s who she was, partly because of the tie he didn’t send me, and he wants to hire you, wouldn’t it be convenient to have the tie? And the envelope and letterhead?"
"I have no expectation of being engaged by Mr. Vance. Nor desire."
"Sure. Because you would have to work. I remarked yesterday that the gross take

 for the first seven months of nineteen sixty-two is nine grand behind nineteen sixty-one. I am performing one of the main functions you pay me for."

 for the first seven months of nineteen sixty-two is nine grand behind nineteen sixty-one. I am performing one of the main functions you pay me for."
"Not brilliantly," he said and picked up the book. Merely a childish gesture, since Fritz would enter in eight minutes to announce lunch. I went and opened the safe and stashed my souvenirs on a shelf in the inner compartment.
43
INSPECTOR CRAMER of Homicide South came at ten minutes past six.
==> I had been functioning all afternoon, I don’t say brilliantly. During lunch, in the dining room across the hall, while listening to Wolfe’s table talk with one ear, I decided to make myself scarce while I considered the matter. There was no sense in getting out on a limb just for the hell of it, and a homicide dick might show any minute, so as we left the table I told Wolfe that since we had no expectations or desires I was going out on some personal chores. He gave me a sharp glance, made a face, and headed for the office. As I was turning to the front the phone rang and I went in and got it. If it was the DA’s office inviting me to call, I would make up my mind on the way downtown. <==
It was Lon Cohen. He had compliments. "No question about it, Archie," he said, "you’d be worth your weight in blood rubies to any newspaper in town, especially the Gazette. At nine-thirty you phone for dope on James Neville Vance. At twelve-twenty, less than three hours later, a cop finds a body in his house and both you and he are present. Marvelous. Any leg man can find out what happened, but knowing what’s going to happen - you’re one in ten million. What’s on the program for tomorrow? I only want a day at a time."
I was a little short with him because my problem was the program for today.
I was out of the house and halfway to Eighth Avenue, no destination in mind, when I realized I was ignoring the main point - no, two main points. One, if a dick came before Wolfe went up to the plant rooms at four o’clock, Wolfe might possibly give him the souvenirs, to keep me out of trouble. Two, if the spot on the tie wasn’t blood and its being sent to me was just some kind of a gag, and it had no connection with a murder, I was stewing about nothing. So I turned and went back. Wolfe, at his desk with his book, apparently paid no attention as I opened the safe and took out the souvenirs, but of course he saw. I pocketed

 them and left.

Twenty minutes later I was seated in a room on the tenth floor of a building on 43rd Street, telling a man at a desk, "This is for me personally, Mr. Hirsh, not for Mr. Wolfe, but it’s possible that he may have a use for it before long." I put the tie on the desk and pointed to the spot. "How long will it take to tell what that is?"
He bent his head for a look without touching it. "Maybe ten minutes, maybe a week."
"How long will it take to tell if it’s blood?"

Any leg man can find out what happened, but knowing what’s going to happen - you’re one in ten million. What’s on the program for tomorrow? I only want a day at a time."
I was a little short with him because my problem was the program for today.
I was out of the house and halfway to Eighth Avenue, no destination in mind, when I realized I was ignoring the main point - no, two main points. One, if a dick came before Wolfe went up to the plant rooms at four o’clock, Wolfe might possibly give him the souvenirs, to keep me out of trouble. Two, if the spot on the tie wasn’t blood and its being sent to me was just some kind of a gag, and it had no connection with a murder, I was stewing about nothing. So I turned and went back. Wolfe, at his desk with his book, apparently paid no attention as I opened the safe and took out the souvenirs, but of course he saw. I pocketed

 them and left.
==> Twenty minutes later I was seated in a room on the tenth floor of a building on 43rd Street, telling a man at a desk, "This is for me personally, Mr. Hirsh, not for Mr. Wolfe, but it’s possible that he may have a use for it before long." I put the tie on the desk and pointed to the spot. "How long will it take to tell what that is?" <==
He bent his head for a look without touching it. "Maybe ten minutes, maybe a week."
"How long will it take to tell if it’s blood?"
He got a glass from a drawer and took another look. "It’s a fairly fresh stain. That it isn’t blood, negative for hemoglobin, ten minutes. That it is blood, thirty or forty minutes. That it is or isn’t human blood, up to ninety minutes, maybe less. To type it with certainty if it’s human, at least five hours."
"I only need yes or no on the human. Would you have to ruin the whole spot?" "Oh, no. Just a few threads."
"Okay, I’ll wait. As I say, it’s not for Mr. Wolfe, but I’ll appreciate it very much. I’ll be in the anteroom."

"You might as well wait here." He rose, with the tie. "I’ll have to do it myself. It’s vacation time and we’re shorthanded."
An hour and a half later, at twenty minutes to five, I was in a down elevator, the tie back in my pocket minus only a few threads. It was human blood, and the stain was less than a week old, probably much less. So I wasn’t in a stew for nothing, but now what? Of course I could go back to the office and try for fingerprints on the envelope and letterhead, but that would have been just passing time since I had nothing to compare them with. Or I could phone James Neville Vance, tell him what the spot was, and ask if he now had any ideas or suggestions, but that would have been pushing it, since I didn’t know whether he had told the cops why I was there.
Considering, as I emerged to the sidewalk, how little I did know, next to nothing, that it was either go home and sit on it or learn something somehow, and that the

Gazette building was only a five-minute walk, I turned east at 44th Street. Lon Cohen’s room is on the twentieth floor, two doors down the hall from the corner office of the publisher. When I walked in, having been announced, he was at one of the three phones on his desk, and I sat. When he hung up he swiveled and said, "No welcome. If you were a real pal you would have told me this morning and we could have had a photographer there."

As for today, Kirk had phoned police headquarters a little before noon, saying that he had dialed his wife’s number six times in eighteen hours and got no answer; that he had gone to the house around eleven o’clock, got no response to his ring from the vestibule, used his key to get in, pushed the button at the apartment door repeatedly and heard the bell, without result, and departed without entering; and that he wanted the police to take a look. He had been asked to be there to let a cop use his key but had declined.


Bonny Kirk had last been seen alive, to present knowledge, by a man from a package store who had delivered a bottle of vodka to her at the apartment door, and been paid by her, a little before one o’clock Monday afternoon. The unopened vodka bottle, found under the couch with blood on it, had been used to smash Bonny Kirk’s skull sometime between one P.M. and eight P.M. Monday, the latter limit having been supplied by the medical examiner.
Among those who had been summoned or escorted to the DA’s office were Martin Kirk, James Neville Vance, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Fougere, and Bert Odom, the janitor. Presumably some of them, perhaps all, were still there.
==> For all that and a lot more I’m leaving out I didn’t owe Lon anything, since on our give-and-take record to date I had a credit balance, and I didn’t mention the necktie. Of course he wanted to know who Wolfe’s client was and what about Vance, and it never hurts to have Wolfe’s name in the paper, not to mention mine, but since the whole point was that Wolfe was short on clients I decided to save it. Naturally he didn’t believe it, that Wolfe had no client, and when I got up to go he said, "No welcome and no fare you well either." <==
I took a taxi because Wolfe likes to find me in the office when he comes down from the plant rooms at six o’clock, and he pays me and I had spent the day on personal chores, but with the traffic at that hour I might as well have walked, and it was ten past six when the hackie finally made it. As I was climbing out, a car I recognized pulled up just behind, and as I stood a man I also recognized got out of it - a big solid specimen with a big red face topped by an old felt hat even on a hot August day. As he approached I greeted him, "I’ll be damned. You yourself?"
Ignoring me, he called to my hackie, "Where did you get this fare?" Apparently the hackie recognized Inspector Cramer of Homicide South, for he called back, "Forty-second and Lexington, Inspector."
"All right, move on." To me: "We’ll go in."
I shook my head. "I’ll save you the trouble. Mr. Wolfe has a new book and there’s no point in annoying him. The tie was mailed to me, not him, and he knows nothing about it and doesn’t want to."
"I’d rather get that from him. Come on."

Nothing doing. He’s sore enough as it is, and so am I. I’ve wasted a day. I’ve learned that the spot on the tie is human blood, but what - "
"How did you learn that?"
"I had it tested at a laboratory."

"Nuts. Evidence of what? Even with blood it’s not evidence if it isn’t the same type as the victim’s. As for leaving the scene, I wasn’t concerned and no one told me to stay. As for tampering, it’s still a perfectly good spot with just a few threads gone. I had to know if it was blood because if it wasn’t I was going to keep it, and if a court ordered me to fork it over I would have fought it. I wanted to find out who had sent it to me and why, and I still do. But since it’s blood I couldn’t fight an order." I got the souvenirs from my pockets. "Here. When you’re through with them I want them back."
"You do." He took them and looked them over. "There’s a typewriter in Vance’s place. Did you take a sample from it for comparison?"
"You know damn well I didn’t, since he has told you what I said and did."
"He could forget. Is this the tie you got in the mail this morning and is this the envelope it came in?"
"Yes. Now that’s an idea. I could have got another set from Vance. I wish I’d thought of it."
==> "You could have. I know you. I’m taking you down, but we’ll go in first. I want to ask Wolfe a question." <==
"I’m not going in, and one will get you ten you won’t get in. He’s not interested and doesn’t intend to be. I could come down after dinner. We’re having lobsters, simmered in white wine with tarragon, and a white wine sauce with the tomalley and coral - "
"I’m taking you." He aimed a thumb at the car. "Get in."

I GOT HOME well after midnight and before going up two flights to bed hit the refrigerator for leftover lobster and a glass of milk, to remove both hunger and the taste of the excuse for bread and stringy corned beef I had been supplied with at the DA’s office.
Since my connection with their homicide had been short and simple, the twenty seconds I had spent in the Kirk apartment, and my connection with Vance hadn’t been a lot longer, an hour of me should have been more than enough, including typing the statement for me to sign, and it wasn’t until after nine o’clock that I realized, from a question by Assistant DA Mandel, what the idea was. They actually thought that the tie thing might be some kind of dodge that I had been in on, and they were keeping me until they got a report on the stain. So I cooled down and took it easy, got on speaking terms with a dick who was put in a room with me to see that I didn’t jump out a window, got him to produce a deck for some friendly gin, and in two hours managed to lose $4.70. I called time at that point and paid him because he was getting sleepy and it would have been next to impossible to keep him ahead.
I got my money’s worth. Around midnight someone came and called him out, and when he returned ten minutes later and said I was no longer needed I gave him a friendly grin, a good loser, no hard feelings, and said, "So the blood’s the same type, huh?" And he nodded and said, "Yeah, modern science is wonderful."
==> So, I told myself as I got the lobster out, I got not only my money’s worth but my time’s worth, and by the time I was upstairs and in my pajamas I had decided that if Wolfe wasn’t interested I certainly was, and I was going to find out who had sent me that tie even if I had to take a month’s leave of absence. <==
Except in emergencies I get a full eight hours’ sleep, and that was merely a project, not an emergency, so I didn’t get down for breakfast, which I eat in the kitchen, until after ten o’clock. As I got orange juice from the refrigerator and Fritz started the burner under the cake griddle he asked where I had dined, and I said he knew darned well I hadn’t dined at all, since I had phoned that I was at the DA’s office, and he nodded and said, "These clients in trouble."
"Look, Fritz," I told him, "you’re a chef, not a diplomat, so why do you keep that up? You know we’ve had no client for a month and you want to know if we’ve hooked one, so why don’t you just ask? Repeat after me, ‘Have we got a client?’

 Try it."
"Archie." He turned a palm up. "You would have to say yes or no. The way I do it, you can biaiser if you wish."

 Try it."
"Archie." He turned a palm up. "You would have to say yes or no. The way I do it, you can biaiser if you wish."
I had to ask him how to spell it so I could look it up when I went to the office. Sitting, I picked up the Times, and my brow went up when I saw that it had made the front page. Probably on account of Martin Kirk; the Times loves architects as much as it hates disk jockeys and private detectives. It had nothing useful to add to what I had got from Lon, but it mentioned that Mrs. Kirk had been born in Manhattan, Kansas. Any other paper which had dug up that detail would have had a feature piece about born in Manhattan and died in Manhattan.
==> After three griddle cakes with homemade sausage and one with thyme honey, and two cups of coffee, I made it to the office in time to have the desks dusted, fresh water in the vase, biaiser looked up, and the mail opened, when Wolfe came down from the plant rooms. I waited until the orchids were in the vase and he had sat and glanced through the mail to tell him that it now looked as if someone had sent me a hot piece of evidence in a homicide, and I intended to find out why, of course on my own time, and anyway he wouldn’t be needing me since apparently there was nobody that needed him. <==
His lips tightened. "Evidence? Merely a conjecture."
"No, sir. I took it to Ludlow and it’s human blood. So I gave it to Cramer. Of
course you’ve read the Times?" "Yes."
"The blood is the same type as Mrs. Kirk’s. If it was or is a floundering numskull, obviously I’d better see - "
The doorbell rang.

"The blood is the same type as Mrs. Kirk’s. If it was or is a floundering numskull, obviously I’d better see - "
The doorbell rang.
I got up and went, telling myself it was even money it was James Neville Vance, but it wasn’t. A glance at the one-way glass panel in the front door settled that. It was a panhandler who had run out of luck and started ringing doorbells - a tall, lanky one pretending he had to lean against the jamb to keep himself upright. Opening the door, I said politely, "It’s a hard life. Good morning."
==> He got me in focus with bleary eyes and said, "I would like to see Nero Wolfe. <==

 My name is Martin Kirk."
If you think I should have recognized him from the pictures Lon had shown me, I don’t agree. You should have seen him. I told him Mr. Wolfe saw people only by appointment, but I’d ask. "You’re the Martin Kirk who lives at Two-nineteen Horn Street?"
He said he was, and I invited him in, ushered him into the front room and to a seat, which he evidently needed, went to the office by way of the connecting door, closed the door, and crossed to Wolfe’s desk. "I’m on my own time now," I told him. "It’s Martin Kirk. He asked to see you, but of course you’re not interested. May I use the front room?"
He took a deep breath, in through his nose and out through his mouth, then glared at me for five seconds and growled, "Bring him in."

Unheard of. Absolutely contrary to nature - his nature. The Nero Wolfe I thought I knew would at least have wanted me to pump him first. With a genius you never know. As I returned to the front room and told Kirk to come, I decided that the idea must be to show me that I would be a sap to waste my time. He would make short work of Martin Kirk. So as Kirk flopped into the red leather chair near the end of Wolfe’s desk he snapped at him, "Well, sir? I have read the morning paper. Why do you come to me?"
Kirk pressed the heels of his palms against his eyes. He groaned. He lowered his hands and the bleary eyes blinked a dozen times. "You’ll have to make allowances," he said. "I just left the district attorney’s office. I was there all night and no sleep."

Wolfe made a face. That complicated it. The mere thought of a man going without food was disagreeable, and to have one there in his house was intolerable. He had to either get him out in a hurry or feed him. "Why should I

 make allowances?" he demanded.

"Did you kill your wife?"
"No. But they think I did, and they think they can prove it. I haven’t got a lawyer, and I don’t know any lawyer I want to go to.

==> I told him yes and he went back to Wolfe. "They asked if I knew you or Goodwin, if I had ever met you, and they seemed to think I had - no, they did think I had. It seemed to have some connection with something that was mailed to Goodwin, and something about a necktie, and something about a phone call he got yesterday. I’m sorry to be so vague, but I said you’d have to make allowances, I’m not myself. I haven’t been myself since - I found - " His jaw had started to work and he stopped to control it. "My wife," he said. "They kept at me that she wasn’t much of a wife, and all right, she wasn’t, but if a woman - I mean if a man - " <==
He stopped again to handle his jaw. In a moment he went on, "So I came to you partly because I thought you might know about a necktie and a phone call and something that was mailed to Goodwin. Do you?"
"Possibly." Wolfe was regarding him. "Mr. Kirk. You said you can pay me, but I don’t sell information; I sell only services."
"That’s what I want, your services."
"You want to hire me to investigate this affair?" "Yes. That’s why I’m here."
"And you can pay me without undue strain?" "Yes. I have - Yes. Do you want a check now?"

Kirk actually tried to smile, and it made me want to feed him myself. "I know about you," he said. "You’re hard. And you charge high fees. I can pay you, don’t worry about that. They think I killed my wife. They let me go, but they - "
"Did you kill your wife?"
"No. But they think I did, and they think they can prove it. I haven’t got a lawyer, and I don’t know any lawyer I want to go to. I came to you because I know about you - partly that, and partly because they asked me a lot of questions about you - about you and Archie Goodwin."

==> I had to shut my eyes a second to keep from gawking. That wasn’t only unheard of, it was unbelievable. Taking on a job, which meant that he would have to work, without the usual dodging and stalling - that could be on account of the lag in receipts; but taking a murder suspect for a client offhand, no questions asked but the routine did you kill her and can you pay me, without the faintest notion whether he was guilty or not and how much the cops had on him - that simply wasn’t done, not by anybody, let alone Nero Wolfe. I had to clamp my teeth on my lip to sit and take it. As Kirk got out a checkfold and a pen Wolfe pushed a button on his desk, and in a moment Fritz came. <==
"A tray, please," Wolfe told him. "The madrilène is ready?" "Yes, sir."
"And the pudding?"
"Yes, sir."
"A bowl of each, cheese with water cress, and hot tea."
When Fritz turned and went I would have liked to go along, to tell him that there could be something worse than having no client.

AN HOUR LATER, when the doorbell rang again, Kirk was still there and still the client, and I would still have had to toss a coin to decide where I stood on the question, did he or didn’t he?
==> Wolfe had of course refused to either talk or listen until the tray had come and gone. Kirk had said he couldn’t eat, but when Wolfe insisted he tried, and if a man can swallow anything he can swallow Fritz’s madrilène with beet juice, and after one spoonful of his lemon sherry pudding with brown sugar sauce there’s no argument. The cheese and water cress were still on the tray when I took it to the kitchen, but the bowls were empty. <==
When I returned Wolfe had started in. "... so I’ll reverse the process," he was saying. "I’ll tell you and then ask you. Are you sufficiently yourself to

 comprehend?"
"I’m better. I didn’t think I could eat. I’m glad you made me." He didn’t look any better.
Wolfe nodded. "The brain can be hoodwinked but not the stomach. First, then, your statement that you didn’t kill your wife is of course of no weight. I have assumed that you didn’t for reasons of my own, which I reserve. Do you know or suspect who did kill her?"

"Then attend. An item in yesterday’s mail to this house was an envelope addressed to Mr. Goodwin, typewritten. A paper inside had a typewritten note saying, ‘Archie Goodwin, keep this until you hear from me, JNV.’ The envelope and paper were the engraved stationery of James Neville Vance. Also in the envelope was a four-in-hand necktie, cream-colored with brown diagonal stripes, and it had a spot on it, a large brown stain."
Kirk was squinting, concentrating. "So that’s how it was. They never told me exactly..."
"They wouldn’t. Neither would I if I weren’t engaged in your interest. At a quarter past eleven yesterday morning Mr. Goodwin got a phone call, and a voice that squeaked, presumably for disguise, said it was James Neville Vance and asked him to burn what he had received in the mail. Mr. Goodwin, provoked, went to Two-nineteen Horn Street and was admitted by Vance, who identified the tie as one of his but denied that he had sent it. As Mr. Goodwin was about to go a policeman arrived who wanted access to your apartment, and he was with Mr. Vance and the policeman when your wife’s body was discovered, but he left immediately. Later he took - "

"About two months ago."
"Where is it now?"
"I suppose - I don’t know."
"When you moved to a hotel room two weeks ago you took personal effects. Including that tie?"
"I don’t know. I didn’t notice. I took all my clothes, but I wasn’t noticing things like ties. I’ll see if it’s there."
==> "It isn’t." Wolfe took a deep breath, leaned back, and closed his eyes. Kirk looked at me, blinking, and was going to say something, but I shook my head. He had said enough already to make me think it might have been better all around if I had burned the damned souvenirs and crossed it off. He put his palms to his temples and massaged. <==
Wolfe opened his eyes and straightened up. He regarded Kirk, not cordially. "It’s a mess," he stated. "I have questions of course, but you’ll answer them more to the point if I first expound this necktie tangle. Are your wits up to it? Should you sleep first?"
"No. If I don’t - I’m all right."
"Pfui. You can’t even focus your eyes properly. I’ll merely describe it and ignore the intricacies. Assuming that the blood on the tie is in fact your wife’s blood, there are three obvious theories. The police theory must be that when you killed your wife the blood got on the tie, either inadvertently or by your deliberate act,

 and to implicate Vance you used his stationery to mail it to Mr. Goodwin. It was probably premeditated, since you had the stationery at hand. I don’t ask if that was possible; the police must know it was. You had been in his apartment, hadn’t you?"

"They were already public property - our little public." He swallowed. "I knew when I married her that she was promis - no, she wasn’t promiscuous, she was too sensitive for that. She was incredibly beautiful. You know that?"
"No."
"She was. I thought then that she was simply curious about men, and impetuous - and a little reckless. I didn’t know until after we had been married a few months that she had no moral sense about sexual relations - not just no moral sense, no sense. She was sensitive, very sensitive, but that’s different. But I was stuck. I don’t mean I was stuck just because I was married to her, that’s simple enough nowadays, I mean I was really stuck. Do you know what it’s like to have all your feelings and desires, all the desires that really matter, to have them all centered on a woman, one woman?"
"No."
"I do." He shook his head, jerked it from side to side several times. "What got me started?"
==> He could have meant either what got him started on that woman or what got him started talking about her. Wolfe, assuming the latter, said, "I asked you about Mr. Vance. Was he one of the objects of her curiosity?" <==
"Good Lord, no."
"You can’t be sure of that."
"Oh yes I can. She never bothered to pretend. I tell you, she had no sense. I did some work for Vance on a couple of buildings, and I had that apartment before I

as married. For her he was a nice old guy, rather a bore, who let her use one of his pianos when she felt like it. I am sure."

He stopped abruptly. Wolfe eyed him. "His name?" "No. He didn’t want her dead."

I want the answers you have given the police. I don’t ask where you were Monday afternoon because if you were excluded by an alibi you wouldn’t be here. Why did you move to a hotel room two weeks ago? What you have told the police." <==
"I told them the truth. I had to decide what to do. Seeing my wife and hearing her, having her touch me - it had become impossible."
"Did you decide what to do?"
"Yes. I decided to try to persuade her to have a baby. I thought that might make her ... might change her. I realized I couldn’t be sure the baby was mine, but there was no way out of that. That’s what I told the police, but it wasn’t true. The baby idea was only one of many that I thought of, and I knew it was no good, I knew I couldn’t take it, not knowing if I was its father. I didn’t actually decide anything."
"But you dialed her phone number six times between four o’clock Monday afternoon and ten o’clock Tuesday morning. What for?"
"What I told the police? To say I wanted to see her, to persuade her to have a baby."

You could pity me or you could sneer at me, but I wouldn’t give a damn, it wouldn’t mean a thing. Say I was obsessed, and what does that mean? I still had my faculties, I could do my work pretty well, and I could even think straight about her, as far as thinking went. One of the ideas I had, I realized that the one thing I could do that would settle it was to kill her. I knew I couldn’t do it, but I realized that that was the one sure thing, and I wished I could do it." <==
He opened the fists and closed them again. "I hadn’t seen her or heard her voice for two weeks, and I dialed the number, and when there was still no answer the sixth time I went there. When there was no answer to my ring from the vestibule and I went in and took the elevator I intended to use my key upstairs too, but I didn’t. I simply couldn’t. She might be there and - and not alone. I left and went

 to a bar and bought a drink but didn’t drink it. I wanted to know if her things were there, and I thought of phoning Jimmy Vance, but finally decided to phone police headquarters instead. Even if they found her there and someone with her, that might - "
The doorbell rang, and I went, again giving myself even money that it was Vance, and losing again. It was a girl, or woman, and she had a kind of eyes that I had met only twice before, once a woman and once a man. I have a habit, when it’s a stranger on the stoop, of taking a five-second look through the one-way glass and tagging him or her, to see how close I can come. From inside, the view through the glass is practically clear, but from the outside it might as well be wood. But she could see through. Of course she couldn’t, but she was face-to- face with me, and her eyes, slanted up, had exactly the look they would have if she were seeing me. They were nice enough hazel eyes, but I hadn’t liked it the other two times it had happened, and I didn’t like it then. Not trying to tag her, I opened the door.
"I beg your pardon," she said. "I believe Mr. Kirk is here? Martin Kirk?"

It wasn’t possible. They wouldn’t put a female dick on his tail, and even if they did she wouldn’t be it, with that attractive little face and soft little voice. But there she was. "I beg your pardon," I said, "but what makes you think so?"

"That’s an odd name. Nero Wolfe? What does he - Is he a lawyer?"
Either she meant it or she was extremely good. If the former, it would be a pleasure to tell Wolfe and see him grunt. "No," I said. Let her work for it.

"I beg your pardon," she said. "I believe Mr. Kirk is here? Martin Kirk?"
It wasn’t possible. They wouldn’t put a female dick on his tail, and even if they did she wouldn’t be it, with that attractive little face and soft little voice. But there she was. "I beg your pardon," I said, "but what makes you think so?"
"He must be. I saw him come in and I haven’t seen him come out." "Then he’s here. And?"
"Would you mind telling me whose house - who lives here?" "Nero Wolfe. It’s his house and he lives here."
"That’s an odd name. Nero Wolfe? What does he - Is he a lawyer?"
==> Either she meant it or she was extremely good. If the former, it would be a pleasure to tell Wolfe and see him grunt. "No," I said. Let her work for it. <==
"Is Mr. Kirk all right?"
"We haven’t been introduced," I said. "My name is Archie Goodwin and I live here. Your turn."


Her mouth opened and closed again. She considered it, her eyes meeting mine exactly as they had when she couldn’t see me. "I’m Rita Fougere," she said. "Mrs. Paul Fougere. Will you tell Mr. Kirk I’m here and would like to see him?"

==> It was my turn to consider. The rule didn’t apply - the rule that I am to take no one in to Wolfe without consulting him; she wanted to see Kirk, not Wolfe. And I was riled. The tie had been mailed to me, not him, but he hadn’t even glanced at me before taking Kirk on and feeding him. I was by no means satisfied that Kirk was straight, and I wanted to see how he took it when Paul Fougere’s wife suddenly appeared. <==
"You might as well tell him yourself," I said. "Also you might as well know that Nero Wolfe is a private detective, and so am I. Come in."
I made room for her and she entered, and after shutting the door I preceded her down the hall and into the office. As I approached Wolfe’s desk I said, "Someone to see Mr. Kirk," and I was right there when he twisted around and saw her, said "Rita!" and left the chair. She offered both hands, and he took them. "Martin, Martin," she said, low, with those eyes at him.
"But how ..." He let her hands go. "How did you know I was here?" "I followed you."
"Followed me?"
She nodded. "From down there. I was there too, and when I left and had got into a taxi you came out. I called to you but you didn’t hear me, and when you got another taxi I told my driver to follow. I saw you come in here, and I waited outside, and when you didn’t come out, a whole hour - "

"No, just this morning. I was afraid - your face, the way you looked. I was terribly afraid. I know I can’t - or maybe I can. If you’ll come - Have you eaten anything?"

She started a hand to touch him but let it drop. "I’ll wait for you," she said. "I’ll be outside."
"If you please." It was Wolfe. His eyes were at the client. "You have a chore, Mr. Kirk. I need to know if that article is among your belongings in your room, and you will please go and find out and phone me. Meanwhile I’ll talk with Mrs. Fougere. If you will, madam? I’m working for Mr. Kirk."
"Why ..." She looked at Kirk. Those eyes. "If he’s working for you..."

"Nonsense," Wolfe snapped. "She has been questioned by the police. And she’s your friend?"

He said he would and headed for the hall, and I went to see him out. When I returned Mrs. Fougere was in the red leather chair, which would have held two of her, and Wolfe, leaning back, was regarding her without enthusiasm. He would rather tackle almost any man than any woman on earth.

She was sitting straight, her hands curled over the ends of the chair arms, her eyes meeting his. "You’re working for him," she said.

"That will do. What did you say when the police asked if you were in the habit of lunching with Mr. Kirk?"
"It wasn’t a habit. He had left his wife and he - he needed friends." "You’re strongly attached to him?"
"Yes."
"Is he attached to you?"
"No."
==> Wolfe grunted. "If this were a hostile examination your answers would be admirable, but for me they’re a little curt. Do you know how your husband spent Monday afternoon?" <==
"I know how he says he did. He went to Long Island City to look at some equipment and got back too late to go to the office. He went to a bar and had drinks and came home a little before seven, and we went out to a restaurant for dinner." She made a little gesture. "Mr. Wolfe, I don’t want to be curt. If I thought I knew anything that would help Martin, anything at all, I’d tell you."
"Then we’ll see what you know. What if I establish that your husband killed Mrs. Kirk?"

She took a moment. "Do you mean if you proved it? If you got him arrested for it?"
Wolfe nodded. "That would probably be necessary to clear Mr. Kirk."

"Yes."
"They knew you were?"
"Yes."

"They knew you were?"
"Yes."
"You were complacent about it?"
"No." It came out a whisper, and she repeated it. "No." Her mouth began working, and she clamped her jaw to stop it. "Of course," she said, "you think I might have killed her. If I had, it would have been on account of Martin, not my husband. She was ruining Martin’s life, making it impossible for him. But she couldn’t ruin my husband’s life because he’s too - well, too shallow."
She stopped, breathed, and went on, "I wouldn’t have dreamed that I would ever be saying things like this, to anyone, but I said some of them even to the police. Now I would say anything if it would help Martin. I wasn’t complacent about Paul and Bonny; it just didn’t matter, because nothing mattered but Martin. I was an ignorant little fool when I married Paul, I thought I might as well because I had never been in love and I thought I never would be. When they began asking me questions yesterday I decided I wouldn’t try to hide how I feel about Martin, and anyway, I don’t think I could, now. I did before."
==> Wolfe looked at the clock. Twenty to one. Thirty-five minutes till lunch. "You say she couldn’t have ruined your husband’s life because he’s too shallow. Do you utterly reject the possibility that he killed her?" <==
She took a breath. "I don’t - That’s too strong. If he was there with her and she

 said something or did something... I don’t know."
"Do you know if he had in his possession some of the personal stationery of James Neville Vance? A letterhead, an envelope?"
Her eyes widened. "What? Jimmy Vance?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74212    window = 74207 74217


Mr. Kirk?"
"No, never. He drinks scotch."
"Does Mr. Vance?"
"Yes. He got my husband started on it. The police asked me all this." "Naturally. Do you drink vodka?"
"No. I drink sherry." She shook her head. "I don’t understand - maybe you’ll tell me. All the questions the police asked me - they seem to be sure it was one of us, Martin or Paul or Jimmy Vance or me. Now you too. But it could have been some other man that Bonny ... or someone, a burglar or something - couldn’t it?"
==> "Not impossible," Wolfe conceded, "but more than doubtful. Because of the circumstance that prompted my question about Mr. Vance’s stationery, and now this question: What kind of a housekeeper are you? Do you concern yourself with the condition of your husband’s clothing?" <==
She nearly smiled. "You ask the strangest questions. Yes, I do. Even though we’re not - Yes, I sew on buttons."
"Then you know what he has, or had. Have you ever seen among his things a cream-colored necktie with diagonal brown stripes, narrow stripes?"
She frowned. "That’s Jimmy Vance again, those are his colors. He has a tie like that, more than one probably."
"He had nine. Again a simple question. Have you ever seen one of them in your husband’s possession? Not necessarily in his hands or on his person; say in one of his drawers?"
"No. Mr. Wolfe, this circumstance - what is it? You say Martin knows about it, but I’m answering your questions, and I - "

"Of course you made sure."

Yes. Positive."
"Hold the wire." I turned. "Kirk. The article isn’t there." He nodded. "As expected."

"Martin?"
"Yes. Rita?"
"Yes. Where are you?"
"In my room at the hotel. You’re still there?"
"Yes. What are you going to do? Are you going to your office?"

I cut in. "Hold it. I’ve told Mr. Wolfe and he’ll have instructions. Hold the wire." I turned. "He says he’s going to see Vance. Shall I tell him to lay off or will you?"
"Neither. He’s had no sleep and not much to eat. Tell him to come this evening, say nine o’clock, if he’s awake, and report on his talk with Mr. Vance."
"You tell him," I said and hung up. Being a salaried employee, I should of course keep my place in the presence of company, and that’s exactly what I was doing, keeping my place. I had had enough and then some, and Wolfe’s glare, which of course came automatically, was wasted because my head was turned and he had my profile, including the set of my jaw. When Rita was through with the phone he took it, spoke briefly with his client, cradled it, and looked at the clock. Six minutes to lunch.

Do you want me any more?" she asked him. "I’d like to go." "Later perhaps," he said. "If you’ll phone a little after six?"

==> I cut in. "Hold it. I’ve told Mr. Wolfe and he’ll have instructions. Hold the wire." I turned. "He says he’s going to see Vance. Shall I tell him to lay off or will you?" <==
"Neither. He’s had no sleep and not much to eat. Tell him to come this evening, say nine o’clock, if he’s awake, and report on his talk with Mr. Vance."
"You tell him," I said and hung up. Being a salaried employee, I should of course keep my place in the presence of company, and that’s exactly what I was doing, keeping my place. I had had enough and then some, and Wolfe’s glare, which of course came automatically, was wasted because my head was turned and he had my profile, including the set of my jaw. When Rita was through with the phone he took it, spoke briefly with his client, cradled it, and looked at the clock. Six minutes to lunch.

Do you want me any more?" she asked him. "I’d like to go." "Later perhaps," he said. "If you’ll phone a little after six?"
I got up and spoke. "If you don’t mind, Mrs. Fougere." I crossed to the door to the front room and opened it. "If you’ll wait in here just a few minutes?"

She looked at Wolfe, saw that he had no comment, and came. When she had crossed the sill I closed the door, which is as soundproof as the wall, went to Wolfe’s desk, and said, "If it blows up in your face you’re not going to blame it on me. I merely called your attention a couple of times to the fact that a fee would be welcome. I didn’t say it was desperate, that you should grab a measly grand from a character who is probably going to be tagged for the big one. And now when he says he is going to see Vance, to handle the tie question on his own - and the tie was sent to me, not you - you not only don’t veto it, you don’t even tell me to go and sit in. Also she’s going there too, that’s obvious, and you merely tell her to phone you later. I admit you’re a genius, but when you took his check you couldn’t possibly have had the faintest idea whether he was guilty or not, and even now you don’t know the score. They may have him absolutely wrapped up. The tie was mailed to me and I gave it to Cramer, and I’m asking, not respectfully."
He nodded. "Well said. A good speech." "Thank you. And?"

He nodded. "Well said. A good speech." "Thank you. And?"
"I didn’t tell you to go because it’s lunchtime. Also I doubt if you would get anything useful. Naturally I’ll have to see Mr. Vance - and Mr. Fougere. As for desperation, when I took Mr. Kirk’s check I knew it was extremely improbable that he had killed his wife, and I - "
"How?"
He shook his head. "You call me to account? You know everything that I know; ponder it yourself. If instead of lunch you choose to be present at a futile conversation, do so by all means. I will not be hectored into an explanation you shouldn’t need."
Fritz entered to announce lunch, saw what the atmosphere was, and stood. I went and opened the door to the front room, passed through, and told Rita, "All right, Mrs. Fougere. I’m going along."

WHEN YOU’RE GOOD and sore at someone it’s simple. You cuss him out, to his face if he’s available and privately if he isn’t, and you take steps if and as you can. When you’re sore at yourself it’s even simpler; the subject is right there and can’t skip. But when you’re sore at yourself and someone else at the same time you’re in a fix. If you try to concentrate on one the other one horns in and gets you off balance, and that was the state I was in as I stood aside in the vestibule of Two-nineteen Horn Street while Rita Fougere used her key on the door. In the taxi on the way down I had told her about the necktie problem. She might as well get it from me as later from Kirk, and she might as well understand why Kirk wanted to see Vance.
I supposed she would want to go first to her own apartment on the ground floor; surely any woman would whose face needed attention as much as hers - but no. Straight to the elevator and up, and out at the third floor, and she pressed the button at Vance’s door. It opened, and Vance was there. His face wasn’t as neat and smooth as it had been the day before, and he had on a different outfit - a conservative gray suit, a white shirt, and a plain gray tie. Of course the DA’s office had had him down too. He said "Rita!" and put out a hand, then saw me, but I can’t say what kind of a welcome I would have got because Kirk interrupted, stepping over and telling Rita she shouldn’t have come. She said something, but he wasn’t listening because he had noticed me.
==> "I’m glad you’re here," he said. "It’s not very clear in my mind, what Nero Wolfe told me about the tie. I was just going to tell Vance about him. Rita, please! You can’t - this is my trouble." <==
"Listen, Martin," she said, "you shouldn’t be here. I know now why they think it was one of us, so it’s our trouble. You should leave it to him - Nero Wolfe. You shouldn’t be talking about it with anybody, not even me. Isn’t that right, Mr. Goodwin?"
"Mr. Wolfe knew he was coming," I said. I have mentioned that I was sore. "Mr. Wolfe has been called a wizard by various people, and with a wizard you never know. Of course he had me come." I had to force my tongue to let that through, but a private scrap should be kept private.
Vance was frowning at me. "Nero Wolfe had you come? Here?"

A bell tinkled. I was between Vance and the door, and I moved to let him by. He opened the door and a man stepped in, darted a glance around, and squeaked, "What, a party? A hell of a time for a party, Jimmy."

I say he squeaked because he did, but it was obviously his natural squeak, not the kind on the phone that had told me to burn the tie, though it didn’t fit his six feet and broad shoulders and handsome, manly face. "It’s no party, Paul," Vance told him, but Paul ignored him and was at Rita. "My pet, you’re a perfect fright. You look godawful." He wheeled to Kirk. "And look at you, Martin my boy. Only why not? Why are you still loose?" He looked at me. "Are you a cop?"

"Can it," Paul cut in. "You’ve got a nerve to ask anybody anything. Why are you loose? Okay, you killed her, she’s dead. What kind of a dodge are you trying

 with one of Jimmy’s neckties with a spot on it?"
"No," Kirk said. "I didn’t kill her."
"Oh, can it. I was thinking maybe you do have some guts after all. She decorated you with one of the finest pairs of horns on record, and you never moved a finger. You just took it lying down - or I should say standing up. I thought it would be hard to find a poorer excuse for a man, but yesterday when I heard what had happened - "
==> Of course I had heard and read of a man slapping another man, but that was the first time I had ever actually seen it - a smack with an open palm on the side of the head. Kirk said nothing, he merely slapped him, and Paul Fougere said nothing either, he merely started a fist for Kirk’s jaw. I didn’t move. Since Fougere was four inches broader and twenty pounds heavier, I fully expected to see Kirk go down, and in any situation I am supposed to take any necessary steps to protect the interests of a client, but if Wolfe wanted that client protected he could come and do it himself. <==
But I got a surprise and so did Fougere. He landed once, a glancing blow on the shoulder as Kirk twisted and jerked his head back, but that was all. Not that Kirk had any technique. I would guess that the point was that at last he was doing something he had really wanted to do for a long time, and while spirit isn’t all, it’s a lot. He clipped Fougere at least twenty times, just anywhere - face, neck, chest, ribs - never with enough steam to floor him or even stagger him. But one of the wild pokes got the nose fair and square, and the blood started. It was up to me because Vance was busy keeping Rita off, and when the blood had Fougere’s mouth and chin pretty well covered I got Kirk from behind and yanked him back and then stepped in between.
"You’re going to drip," I told Fougere. "I suppose you know where the bathroom is."
He was panting. He put his hand to his mouth, took it away, saw the blood, and turned and headed for the rear. I pivoted. Kirk, also panting, was on a chair, head down, inspecting his knuckles. They probably had no skin left. Vance was staring at him, apparently as surprised as Fougere had been. Rita was positively glowing. With color in her face she was more than attractive. "Should I go?" she asked me. "Does he need help?"
That’s true love. Martin the Great had hit him, so he must be in a bad way. It

That’s true love. Martin the Great had hit him, so he must be in a bad way. It

 would have been a shame to tell her it had been just pecks. I said no, he’d probably make it, and went to help Kirk examine his knuckles. They weren’t so bad.
"Why didn’t you stop them?" Vance demanded.
"I thought I did," I said. "With a mauler like Kirk you have to time it."
==> "I wouldn’t have thought..." He let it go. "Did you say he went to Nero Wolfe?" <==
"No, he did. But I can confirm it, I was present. He has hired Nero Wolfe. That’s why I’m here. I am collecting information that will establish the innocence of Mr. Wolfe’s client. Have you got any?"
"I’m afraid I haven’t." He was frowning. "But of course he is innocent. What Paul Fougere said, that’s ridiculous. I hope he didn’t tell the police that. But with their experience, I don’t suppose - "
The bell tinkled. Vance went to the door and opened it, and in came the law. Anyone with half an eye would know it was the law even if they had never seen or heard of Sergeant Purley Stebbins. Two steps in he stopped for a look and saw me.
"Yeah," he said, "I thought so. You and Wolfe are going to be good and sick of this one. I hope you try to hang on." His eyes went right. Fougere had appeared at the rear of the room. "Everybody, huh? I’m sorry to interrupt, Mr. Vance."
He moved. "You’re wanted downtown for more questions, Mr. Kirk. I’ll take you."

"We’ve got some new ones. I might as well ask one of them now. Did you buy a typewriter at the Midtown Office Equipment Company on July nineteenth and trade in your old one?"
"Yes. I don’t know - July nineteenth - about then, yes."
"Okay. We want you to identify the one you traded in. Come along."

"Okay. We want you to identify the one you traded in. Come along."

 "Are you arresting me?"
"If you prefer it that way I can. Material witness. Or if you balk I’ll phone for a warrant and keep you company till it comes, maybe an hour. With Goodwin here I’ve got to toe the line. He’s hell on wheels, Goodwin is."
Kirk made it to his feet. "All right," he mumbled. He had been without sleep for thirty hours and maybe more. Rita Fougere aimed those eyes at me.
==> I bowed out. Being hell on wheels is fine and dandy if you have anywhere to steer for, but I hadn’t. I went and opened the door and on out, took the elevator down, exchanged no greeting with the driver of the police car out front, though we had met, walked till I found a taxi, and told the hackie 618 West 35th Street; and when he said that was Nero Wolfe’s house I actually said such is fame. That’s the shape I was in. <==
Wolfe was at table in the dining room, putting a gob of his favorite cheese on a wafer. When I entered he looked up and said politely, "Fritz is keeping the kidneys warm."
I stopped three steps in. "Many thanks," I said even more politely. "You were right as usual; the conversation was futile. They had a tail on Kirk, here and to the hotel and on to Horn Street. When Purley Stebbins arrived at Vance’s apartment he knew Kirk was there and he wasn’t surprised to see me. He had come for your client and took him. They have found the typewriter that addressed that envelope to me and the message. It belonged to Kirk, but on July nineteenth he traded it in on another one. Since you don’t talk business at meals, I’ll eat in the kitchen."
I wheeled, hell on wheels, and went to the kitchen.

NEARLY FOUR HOURS LATER, at six o’clock, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Fougere were in the office, waiting for Wolfe to come down from the plant rooms - she in the red leather chair and he in one of the yellow ones in front of Wolfe’s desk. To my surprise he had two marks, a red slightly puffed nose and a little bruise under his left eye. I hadn’t thought Kirk had shown that much power, but of course with bare knuckles it doesn’t take much.

I stopped three steps in. "Many thanks," I said even more politely. "You were right as usual; the conversation was futile. They had a tail on Kirk, here and to the hotel and on to Horn Street. When Purley Stebbins arrived at Vance’s apartment he knew Kirk was there and he wasn’t surprised to see me. He had come for your client and took him. They have found the typewriter that addressed that envelope to me and the message. It belonged to Kirk, but on July nineteenth he traded it in on another one. Since you don’t talk business at meals, I’ll eat in the kitchen."
I wheeled, hell on wheels, and went to the kitchen.

NEARLY FOUR HOURS LATER, at six o’clock, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Fougere were in the office, waiting for Wolfe to come down from the plant rooms - she in the red leather chair and he in one of the yellow ones in front of Wolfe’s desk. To my surprise he had two marks, a red slightly puffed nose and a little bruise under his left eye. I hadn’t thought Kirk had shown that much power, but of course with bare knuckles it doesn’t take much.

I bowed out. Being hell on wheels is fine and dandy if you have anywhere to steer for, but I hadn’t. I went and opened the door and on out, took the elevator down, exchanged no greeting with the driver of the police car out front, though we had met, walked till I found a taxi, and told the hackie 618 West 35th Street; and when he said that was Nero Wolfe’s house I actually said such is fame. That’s the shape I was in.

Nothing had happened to change my attitude or opinion. When I went to the office after finishing with the kept-warm kidneys and accessories Wolfe permitted me to report on the conversation and slugging match at Vance’s apartment, leaning back and closing his eyes to show he was listening, but he didn’t even grunt when I told the Stebbins part, though ordinarily it gets under his skin, way under, when a client is hauled in. When I was through I said it was a good thing he knew Kirk was innocent since otherwise the typewriter development might make him wonder.
His eyes opened. "I didn’t say I knew it. I said it was extremely improbable that he had killed his wife, and it still is. Any of the others could have managed access to his typewriter for a few minutes, in his absence."
"Sure. And when his wife told him she had let someone use it, it made him so mad he got rid of it the next day. She could confirm it, but she’s dead. Tough. Or his getting rid of it just then could have been coincidence, but that would be even tougher. Judges and juries hate coincidence, and I’ve heard you make remarks about it."

"Only when it’s in my way, not when it serves me." He straightened up and reached for his book. "Can Mrs. Fougere have her husband here at six o’clock?"
"I haven’t asked her. I doubt it. They’re not chummy, and he’s the wrong end of the horse."
"Perhaps ..." He considered it. He shook his head. "No. I must see him. Tell her to tell him, or you tell him, that he has slandered my client before witnesses, and he will either sign a retraction and apology or defend a suit for defamation of character. I’ll expect him at six o’clock." He picked up the book and opened it.

Cut. I hadn’t expected him to open up, since he is as pigheaded as I am steadfast, but he could have made some little comment. As I looked up the Fougere number and dialed it, I was actually considering something I had never done and thought I never would: retract, apologize, and ask him please to tell me, as a favor to an old associate and loyal assistant, what the hell was in his mind, if anything. But of course I didn’t. When I hung up after getting no answer from the Fougere number, I had an idea: I would ask him if he wanted me to phone Parker. With a client collared as a material witness and probably headed for the coop on a murder charge, it should be not only routine but automatic for him to

 get Parker. But I looked at his face as he sat, comfortable, his eyes on the book, and vetoed it. He would merely say no and go on reading. It would have improved my feelings to pick up something and throw it at him, but not the situation, so I arose, went to the hall and up two flights to my room, stood at the window, and reviewed the past thirty hours, trying to spot the catch I had missed, granting there had been one. The trouble was I was sore. You can work when you’re sore, or eat or sleep or fight, but you can’t think straight.
==> My next sight of Wolfe was at two minutes past six when the elevator brought him down from the plant rooms and he entered the office. The slander approach had got results. The fifth time I tried the Fougere number, a little after four, Paul had answered, and I poured it on. On the phone his squeak sounded more like the one that had told me to burn the tie, but of course it would. A voice on a phone, unless it’s one you know well, is tricky. He said he’d come. An hour later Rita phoned. She was too frantic to be practical. She wanted to know if we had heard from Kirk, and were we doing anything and if so what, and shouldn’t Kirk have a lawyer. Being sore, I told her Wolfe was responsible to his client, not to her, that Kirk would of course need a lawyer, if and when he was charged with something, and that we were expecting her husband at six o’clock. When she said she knew that and she was coming along, I said she might as well have saved the dime. I am rude to people only when I am being rude to myself, or they have asked for it. I admit she hadn’t asked for it. <==
For Wolfe, being rude is no problem at all. When he entered he detoured around the red leather chair to his desk, gave Rita a nod, sat, narrowed his eyes at the husband, and snapped, "You’re Paul Fougere?"
It’s hard to snap back with a squeak, but Fougere did the best he could with what he had. "You’re Nero Wolfe?"
"I am. Did you kill that woman?"
I had known when I let them in that Fougere had decided on his line. It’s easy to see when a man’s all set. So the unexpected question flustered him. "You know damn well I didn’t," he said. "You know who did, or you ought to."
"Possibly I don’t. Do you?"

 anyway that’s not up to me, it’s up to the cops. But I’m not going to sign anything. I’ve told Vance I shouldn’t have said it, and I’ve told my wife. Ask her." He turned to me. "You were the only other one that heard me. I’m telling you now, I can’t prove it and I shouldn’t have said it." Back to Wolfe: "That covers it. Now try hooking me for defamation of character."
"Pfui." Wolfe flipped a hand to dismiss it. "I never intended to. That was only to get you here. I wanted to tell you something and ask you something. First, you’re a blatherskite. You may perhaps know that Mr. Kirk didn’t kill his wife, but you can’t possibly know that he did. Manifestly you’re either a jackass or a murderer, and conceivably both." He turned his head. "Archie. A twenty-dollar bill, please."
I went to the safe and got a twenty from the petty cash drawer and came back and offered it, but he shook his head. "Give it to Mrs. Fougere." To Paul: "I assume your wife is an acceptable stakeholder. Give her a dollar. Twenty to one Mr. Kirk did not kill his wife."
"You’ve got a bet." Fougere got out his wallet, extracted a bill, and handed it to me. "You keep it, Goodwin. My wife might spend it. I suppose his conviction decides it? Do I have to wait until after the appeals and all the horsing around?"

"Then you know why attention is centered on you four, both the police’s attention and mine. You all had opportunity; any of you could have been admitted to that apartment Monday afternoon by Mrs. Kirk, and Mr. Kirk had a key. The means, the vodka bottle, was at hand. What about motive? Let’s consider that. That’s what I want to discuss with you. You are well acquainted with those three people and their relationships, both with one another and with Mrs. Kirk. Your adroit handling of my charge of slander showed that you have a facile and ingenious mind. I invite you to exercise it. Start with yourself. If you killed Mrs. Kirk, what was your motive?"
Fougere pronounced a word that isn’t supposed to be used with a lady present, and since some lady may read this I’ll skip it. He added, "I didn’t."

Fougere pronounced a word that isn’t supposed to be used with a lady present, and since some lady may read this I’ll skip it. He added, "I didn’t."
"I know. I’ll rephrase it. If you had killed Mrs. Kirk, what would have been your motive? You’re staying to hear my questions because you’re curious. I’m curious too. What would have been your motive? Is it inconceivable that you could have had one? You need not be reserved because your wife is here; she has informed me of your intimacy with Mrs. Kirk. When I suggested to her the possibility that you had killed her, she said no, you were too shallow. Are you?"
==> Fougere looked at Rita. "That’s a new one, my pet. Shallow. You should have told me." To Wolfe: "Certainly I could have had a motive for killing her. I could name four men that could - counting Kirk, five." <==
"What would yours have been?"
"That would depend on when. Two months ago it would have been for my - well, for my health."
"And Monday? I’m not just prattling. Monday?"
"It’s prattle to me. Monday, that would have been different. It would still have been for my health, but in a different way. Very different. Do you want me to spell it out?"
"I think not. So much for you. If your wife killed her, what was her motive?"

"I think not. So much for you. If your wife killed her, what was her motive?"
"Now that’s a thought." He grinned. "That appeals to me. We hadn’t touched each other for nearly a year and she wanted me back. I’m shallow, but I’ve got

 charm. I’m not using it right now, but I’ve got it, don’t think I haven’t."
I was looking at Rita because I had had enough of looking at him, and from the expression on her face I would have given twenty to one that she was thinking what I was: that he was one in a million. He actually had no idea of how she felt about Kirk. Not that he would necessarily have brought it in, but his tone, even more than his words, made it obvious. I took another look at him. A man that dumb could batter a woman’s skull with a vodka bottle and mosey to the nearest bar and order a vodka and tonic.
==> Wolfe had the thought too, for he asked, "Have you no other motive to suggest for your wife?" <==
"No. Isn’t that enough? A jealous wife?"
"There are precedents. I assume Mr. Kirk presents no difficulty. Since you think you know he killed her, you must know why."
"So do you."
"Correct. Since like the others it’s an if. He could no longer abide her infidelities, he couldn’t break loose because he was infatuated, and he couldn’t change her, so he took the only way out, since he wanted to live. You agree?"
"Sure. That has precedents too."

"But he was still hoping."
"Oh sure, for her that was easy. If you had known Bonny - Hell, she could have
played you and kept you hoping. Bonny could play any man alive."
"Have you told the police this?"
"You mean about Vance? No. Why would I? I don’t know why I’m telling you."
==> "I invited it. I worked for it." Wolfe leaned back and took a deep breath, then another one. "I am obliged to you, sir, and I don’t like to be in debt. I’ll save you a dollar. We’ll call the bet off." <==
"We will not," Fougere squeaked. "You want to welsh?"
"No. I want to show my appreciation. Very well; it can be returned to you." Wolfe swiveled. "Madam, it’s fortunate that you came with your husband. There will be three of us to refresh his memory on what he has told me if at some future time he is inclined to forget. I suggest that you should write it down and..."
I was listening with only one ear. Now that I knew which target he was aiming at, I should certainly be able to spot what had made him pick it, and I shut my eyes to concentrate. If you had already spotted it, as you probably had, and are thinking I’m thick, you will please consider that all four points went back to before the body was discovered. I got one point in half a minute, but that wasn’t enough, and by the time I opened my eyes Fougere had gone and Rita was on her feet, prattling. Wolfe looked at me. I am expected - by him - both to understand women and to know how to handle them, which is ridiculous. I’ll skip how I handled her and got her out because I was rude again, making twice in less than two hours.
When I returned to the office after shutting the door behind her I had things to say, but Wolfe was leaning back with his eyes closed, and his lips were working, so I went to my desk and sat. When we’re alone I’ll interrupt him no matter what he’s doing, with only one exception, the lip exercise. When he’s pushing his lips

He opened his eyes, sat up, and growled, "We’re going to need Mrs. Fougere." I stood up. "I might possibly catch her. Is it urgent?"

"Certainly not. We have a job before we’re ready for Mr. Cramer, and not an easy one. Phenomena needed for proof may not exist, and even if they do they may be undiscoverable. Our only recourse - "
The doorbell rang. I got up and went to the hall, took a look, stepped back into the office, and said, "Nuts. Cramer."
"No," he snapped.
"Do you want to count ten?" "No."

==> I admit it’s a pleasure to slip the bolt in, open the door the two inches the chain permits, and through the crack tell a police inspector that Mr. Wolfe is engaged and can’t be disturbed. The simple pleasures of a private detective. But that time I didn’t have it. I was still a step short of the door when a bellow came from the office, my name, and I turned and went back. <==
"Bring him," Wolfe commanded.
The doorbell rang. "Maybe this time you should count ten," I suggested. "No. Bring him."
I went. From my long acquaintance with Cramer’s face I can tell with one glance through the glass if he’s on the warpath, so I knew he wasn’t before I opened the door. He even greeted me as if it didn’t hurt. Of course he didn’t let me take his hat, that would have been going too far, but he removed it on his way down the hall. When he’s boiling he leaves it on. From the way he greeted Wolfe it seemed likely that he would have offered a hand to shake if he hadn’t known that Wolfe never did.
"Another hot day," he said and sat in the red leather chair, not settling back, and hanging on to his hat. "I just stopped in on my way home. You’re never on your way home, because you’re always home."
I stared at him. Unbelievable. He was chatting!

"Merely your conjecture. I give you the fullest assurance, in good faith without reservation, that there will be no illegal entry or any other illegal act."

==> Wolfe nodded. "I’m prepared to. Not to give you facts, for you already have them; I’ll merely expound. You shouldn’t need it, but you have been centered on Mr. Kirk. Do you know all the details of the necktie episode? Mr. Goodwin getting it in the mail, the phone call he received, and his visit to Mr. Vance?" <==
"Yes."
"Then attend. Four points. First the phone call. It came at a quarter past eleven. You assume that Mr. Kirk made it, pretending he was Vance. That’s untenable, or at least implausible. How would he dare? For all he knew, Mr. Goodwin had phoned Vance or gone to see him immediately after opening the envelope. For him to phone and say he was Vance would have been asinine."
Cramer grunted. "He was off his hinges. The shape he was in, he wouldn’t see that."
"I concede the possibility. The second point. When Mr. Goodwin went to see Vance he showed him the envelope and letterhead and let him take the tie to examine it. Vance was completely mystified. You know what was said and done. He inspected the ties in his closet and said that the one that had been mailed to Mr. Goodwin was his. But when Mr. Goodwin asked for it he handed it over without hesitation. Preposterous."
Cramer shook his head. "I don’t think so. The body hadn’t been discovered. He thought it was just some screwy gag."

Nonsense."
"But he did. If he killed her, why isn’t it still nonsense?"
==> "Because it was part of his devious and crackbrained plan." Wolfe looked at the clock. "It’s too close to dinnertime to go into that now. It was ill-conceived and ill-executed, and it was infantile, but it wasn’t nonsense. The third point, and the most significant: two missing neckties. He had nine and had given one to Mr. Kirk, and there were only seven left. Of course you have accounted for that in your theory. How?" <==

That’s obvious. Kirk took it from Vance’s closet. Part of his plan to implicate Vance."
Wolfe nodded. "As Vance intended you to. But have you examined that assumption thoroughly?"
"Yes. I don’t like it. That’s one reason I think the DA is moving too fast. Kirk would have been a sap to do that. Someone else could have taken it to implicate Kirk. For instance, Fougere."
"Why not Vance himself?"

"Yes. I don’t like it. That’s one reason I think the DA is moving too fast. Kirk would have been a sap to do that. Someone else could have taken it to implicate Kirk. For instance, Fougere."
"Why not Vance himself?"
"Because a man doesn’t smash a woman’s skull unless he has a damn good reason and Vance had no reason at all."
Wolfe grunted. "I challenge that, but first the fourth point. Those neckties were an integral item of James Neville Vance’s projection of his selfhood. Made exclusively for him, they were more than merely distinctive and personal; they were morsels of his ego. Conceivably he might have given one of them to someone close and dear to him, but not to Martin Kirk - not unless it was an essential step in an undertaking of vital importance. So it was."
"Damn it," Cramer growled, "his reason!"

"Damn it," Cramer growled, "his reason!"
A corner of Wolfe’s mouth went up. "Your new approach is an improvement, Mr. Cramer. You know I wouldn’t fix on a man as a murderer without a motive, so I must have one for Mr. Vance, and you want it. Not now. You would get up and go. That would be enough for you to take to the district attorney, and while it would postpone a murder charge against my client it would by no means clear him permanently, because I strongly doubt if you can get enough evidence against Vance to hold him, let alone convict him. My knowledge of Vance’s motive is by hearsay, so don’t bother to warn me about withholding evidence; I have none that you don’t have. If I get some I’ll be glad to share it. I need to know with certainty where Mr. Vance will be this evening from ten o’clock on, and when Mr. Goodwin told me that you were at the door it occurred to me that the surest way would be for you to have him with you. Do you want it in writing, signed by both of us, that there will be no illegal act - under penalty of losing our licenses?"
Cramer uttered a word about the same flavor as the one Fougere had used, but of

course there was no lady present. He followed it up. "I suppose I’d send it to the Commissioner so he could frame it?" He flattened his palms on the chair arms. "Look, Wolfe. I know you. I know you’ve got something. I admit your four points taken together add up. I’ll take your word that you won’t send Goodwin to break and enter. I know I can’t pry any more out of you even if it wasn’t time for you to eat, and anyway I eat too. But you say I’m to keep Vance until I hear from you or Goodwin, and that might mean all night, and he’s not just some bum. Nothing doing. Make it tomorrow morning, say ten o’clock, and limit it to six hours if I don’t hear from you or Goodwin, and I’ll buy it."

IF YOU EVER NEED an operative and only the best will do, get Saul Panzer if you can. If Saul isn’t available, get Fred Durkin or Orrie Cather. That was the trio who entered James Neville Vance’s apartment with me at a quarter past ten Thursday morning.
What made the entry legal was that when I rang the bells, both downstairs and upstairs, the doors were opened from the inside. Who opened them was Rita Fougere. Upstairs she held it open until we were in and then closed it. I preferred not to touch the door - not that it mattered, but I like things neat.

The door shut, Rita turned to me. She still had those eyes, but the lids were puffy, and her face had had no attention at all. "Where’s Martin?" she asked. Her

 soft little voice was more like a croak. "Have you heard from him?"
==> I shook my head. "As Mr. Wolfe told you last evening, he’s being held as a material witness. Getting a lawyer to arrange for bail would cost money - his money. This will be cheaper and better if it works. Mr. Wolfe told you that." <==
"I know, but... what if it doesn’t?"
"That’s his department." I turned. "This is Mr. Panzer. Mr. Durkin. Mr. Cather. They know who you are. As you know, you’re to stay put, and if you’d like to help you might make some coffee. If the phone rings answer it. If the doorbell rings don’t answer it. Right?"
"Yes."
"Okay. Gentlemen, sic ‘em."
The way you prowl a place depends on what you’re after. If you’re looking for one large item, say a stolen elephant, of course it’s simple. The toughest is when you’re just looking. We did want one specific item, a necktie, but also we wanted anything whatever that might help, no matter what, and Saul and Fred and Orrie had been thoroughly briefed. So we were just looking after Saul found the necktie, and that means things like inspecting the seams of a mattress and unfolding handkerchiefs and flipping through the pages of books. It takes a lot longer when you are leaving everything exactly as it was.

So we were just looking after Saul found the necktie, and that means things like inspecting the seams of a mattress and unfolding handkerchiefs and flipping through the pages of books. It takes a lot longer when you are leaving everything exactly as it was.
We had been at it over an hour when Saul found the tie. I had shown them the seven on the rack in the closet so they would know what it looked like. Saul and Orrie were up in the studio, and when I heard them coming down the spiral stair I knew they had something and met them at the foot, and Saul handed it to me. It was folded, and pinned to it was one of Vance’s engraved letterheads, on which Saul had written: "Found by me at 11:25 A.M. on August 9, 1962, inside a piano score of Scriabin’s Vers la Flamme which was in a cabinet in the studio of James Neville Vance at 219 Horn Street, Manhattan, New York City." He had signed it with his little twirl on the tail of the z.
"You’re my hero," I told him. "It would be an honor to tie your shoestrings and I want your autograph. But you know how Orrie is on gags and so do I. We’ll take a look."

entered the bedroom, with them following, and went to the closet. The seven were still on the rack; I counted them twice. "Okay," I told Saul, "it’s it. I’ll vote for you for President." I took the seven from the rack and handed them to him. "Here, we’ll take them along."
==> After that it was just looking, both in the apartment and in the studio, and that gets tedious. By two o’clock it was damn tedious because we were hungry and we had decided not to take time out to eat, but Cramer had agreed to keep Vance for six hours, and while we had Exhibit A and that was all Wolfe really expected, an Exhibit X would be deeply appreciated. So we kept at it. <==
A little before three o’clock I was standing in the middle of the living room frowning around. Rita was lying on a couch with her eyes closed. Fred was up in the studio with Saul and Orrie. I was trying to remember some little something that had been in my mind an hour ago, and finally I did. When Fred had taken a pile of gloves from a drawer he had looked in each glove but hadn’t felt in it, and he hadn’t taken them to the light. I went to the bedroom, got the gloves from the drawer, took them to the window, and really looked; and in the fifth glove, a pigskin hand-sewed number, there was Exhibit X. When I saw it inside the glove I thought it was just a gob of some kind of junk, but when I pulled it out and saw what it was I felt something I hadn’t felt very often, a hot spot at the base of my spine. I don’t often talk to myself either, but I said aloud, "Believe it or not, that’s exactly what it is. It has to be." I put it back in the glove, put the glove in my pocket, returned the other gloves to the drawer, went to the phone on the bedstand, and dialed a number.
Wolfe’s voice came: "Yes?" I’ve been trying for years to get him to answer the phone properly.
"Me," I said. "We’ll be there in less than half an hour. Saul found the tie. It was in a piano score in a cabinet in the studio. I just found Exhibit X. I can tell you what he did. After he killed her he cut off a lock of her hair with blood on it, plenty of blood, and took it for a keepsake. After the blood was dry he put it inside one of his gloves in a drawer, which is where I found it. That has to be it. You may not believe it till you see it, but you will then."
"Indeed." A pause. "Satisfactory. Very satisfactory. Bring the glove."
"Certainly. A suggestion - or call it a request. Tell Cramer to have him there at a quarter after four, or half past. We’re starving, including Mrs. Fougere, and we

"You know my schedule. I’ll tell Mr. Cramer six o’clock. Fritz will - "
"No." I was emphatic. "For once you’ll have to skip it. The six hours is up at four o’clock, and if you put it off until six Cramer may let him go home, with or without an escort, and he might find that both the tie and the keepsake are gone. Would that be satisfactory?"
Silence. "No." More silence. "Confound it." Still more. "Very well. Fritz will have something ready."

==> INSPECTOR CRAMER SETTLED BACK in the red leather chair, narrowed his eyes at Wolfe, and rasped, "I’ve told Mr. Vance that this won’t be on any official record and he can answer your questions or not as he pleases." <==
He wouldn’t have settled back if he had been the only city employee present, since he knew that almost certainly some fur was going to fly. Sergeant Purley Stebbins was there at his right on a chair against the wall. Purley never sits with his back to anyone, even his superior officer, if he can help it. James Neville Vance was on a chair facing Wolfe’s desk, between Cramer and me. Rita Fougere was on the couch at the left of my desk, and Saul and Fred and Orrie were grouped over by the big globe.
"There won’t be many questions," Wolfe told Cramer. "Nothing remains to be satisfied but my curiosity on a point or two." His head turned. "Mr. Vance, only you can satisfy it." To me: "Archie?"
I regretted having to take my eyes away from Vance. Not that I thought he needed watching; it was just that I wanted to. You can learn things, or you think you can, from the face of a man who knows something is headed for him but doesn’t know exactly what and is trying to be ready to meet it. Up to that point Vance’s face hadn’t increased my knowledge of human nature. His lips were drawn in tight, and that made his oversized chin even more out of proportion.

 When Wolfe cued me I had to leave it. I got the seven ties from a drawer, put them in a row on Wolfe’s desk, and stood by.

INSPECTOR CRAMER SETTLED BACK in the red leather chair, narrowed his eyes at Wolfe, and rasped, "I’ve told Mr. Vance that this won’t be on any official record and he can answer your questions or not as he pleases."
He wouldn’t have settled back if he had been the only city employee present, since he knew that almost certainly some fur was going to fly. Sergeant Purley Stebbins was there at his right on a chair against the wall. Purley never sits with his back to anyone, even his superior officer, if he can help it. James Neville Vance was on a chair facing Wolfe’s desk, between Cramer and me. Rita Fougere was on the couch at the left of my desk, and Saul and Fred and Orrie were grouped over by the big globe.
"There won’t be many questions," Wolfe told Cramer. "Nothing remains to be satisfied but my curiosity on a point or two." His head turned. "Mr. Vance, only you can satisfy it." To me: "Archie?"
I regretted having to take my eyes away from Vance. Not that I thought he needed watching; it was just that I wanted to. You can learn things, or you think you can, from the face of a man who knows something is headed for him but doesn’t know exactly what and is trying to be ready to meet it. Up to that point Vance’s face hadn’t increased my knowledge of human nature. His lips were drawn in tight, and that made his oversized chin even more out of proportion.

==>  When Wolfe cued me I had to leave it. I got the seven ties from a drawer, put them in a row on Wolfe’s desk, and stood by. <==
"Those," Wolfe told Vance, "are the seven ties that remained on the rack in your closet. I produce them - "
A growl from Cramer stopped him. It would have stopped anybody. It became words. "So you did. Stebbins, take Mr. Vance out to the car. I want to talk to Wolfe."
"No," Wolfe snapped. "I said there would be no illegal entry and there wasn’t. Mr. Goodwin, accompanied by Mr. Panzer, Mr. Durkin, and Mr. Cather, rang the bell at Mr. Vance’s apartment and were admitted by Mrs. Fougere. She was in the apartment with Mr. Vance’s knowledge and consent, having gone there earlier to talk with him. When an officer came to take him to you she remained, with no objection from him. Is that correct, Mrs. Fougere?"
"Yes." It came out a whisper, and she repeated it. "Yes." That time it was a croak.
"Is that correct, Mr. Vance?"

No comment. No response.
"Let me see that," Cramer growled. Of course he would; that’s why I was standing by. I took it from Wolfe and handed it over. He read the statement, twisted around for a look at Saul, and twisted the other way to hand the exhibit to Stebbins.

It’s just as well I haven’t many questions," Wolfe told Vance, "since apparently the few I do have won’t be answered. I’ll try answering them myself, and if you care to correct me, do so. I invite interruptions."
He cocked his head. "You realize, sir, that the facts are manifest. The problem is not what you did, or when or how, but why. As for when, you typed that envelope and message to Mr. Goodwin, using your own stationery and having found or made an opportunity to use Mr. Kirk’s typewriter, at least three weeks ago, since that machine wasn’t available after July nineteenth. Mr. Kirk’s disposing of it just then was of course coincidental. So your undertaking was not only premeditated, it was carefully planned. Also you retrieved the tie you had given Mr. Kirk before he moved from his apartment. Using the typewriter and retrieving the tie of course presented no difficulty, since you owned the house and had master keys. Any comment?"

You know; I don’t; but I can guess. You thought it possible that the situation might so develop that you could somehow use it, so why not keep it?"

Wolfe turned a hand over. "Now the primary why: why did you kill her? I learned yesterday that you probably had an adequate motive, but as I told Mr. Cramer, that was only hearsay. I had to have a demonstrable fact, an act or an object, and you supplied it. Not yesterday or today; you supplied it Tuesday afternoon when, after killing Mrs. Kirk, you stooped over her battered skull, or knelt or squatted, and cut off a lock of her hair, choosing one that had her blood on it. With a knife, or scissors? Did you stoop, or squat, or kneel?"
Vance’s lips moved, but no sound came. Unquestionably he was trying to say "I didn’t" but couldn’t make it.
Wolfe grunted. "I said a demonstrable fact. To demonstrate is to establish as true, and I’ll establish it.

 from the drawer I started too, but I wasn’t expecting him to dart like lightning, and he did; and he got the glove, snatched it out of Wolfe’s hand. Of course he didn’t keep it long. I came from his left side and Purley from his right, and since he had the glove in his right hand it was Purley who got his wrist and twisted it, and the glove dropped to the floor.

Not yesterday or today; you supplied it Tuesday afternoon when, after killing Mrs. Kirk, you stooped over her battered skull, or knelt or squatted, and cut off a lock of her hair, choosing one that had her blood on it. With a knife, or scissors? Did you stoop, or squat, or kneel?"
Vance’s lips moved, but no sound came. Unquestionably he was trying to say "I didn’t" but couldn’t make it.
==> Wolfe grunted. "I said a demonstrable fact. To demonstrate is to establish as true, and I’ll establish it. Mr. Goodwin found the lock of hair, caked with blood, some two hours ago, in a drawer in your bedroom. He called it a keepsake, but a keepsake is something given and kept for the sake of the giver, a token of friendship. Trophy would be a better term." He opened a desk drawer. <==
I can move fast and so can Purley Stebbins, but we both misjudged James Neville Vance, at least I did. When he started up at sight of the glove Wolfe took

 from the drawer I started too, but I wasn’t expecting him to dart like lightning, and he did; and he got the glove, snatched it out of Wolfe’s hand. Of course he didn’t keep it long. I came from his left side and Purley from his right, and since he had the glove in his right hand it was Purley who got his wrist and twisted it, and the glove dropped to the floor.
Cramer picked it up. Purley had Vance by the right arm, and I had him by the left.
Wolfe stood up. "It’s in the glove," he told Cramer. "Mr. Goodwin, will furnish any details you require, and Mrs. Fougere." He headed for the door. The clock said 5:22. His schedule had hit a snag, but by gum it wasn’t wrecked.

"I didn’t phone him."
I must say that Vance was showing more gumption than I had expected. By letting Wolfe talk he was finding out exactly how deep the hole was, and he was saying nothing.

A LITTLE BEFORE FIVE o’clock one afternoon last week the doorbell rang, and through the one-way glass I saw Martin Kirk on the stoop, his overcoat collar turned up and his hat on tight. When I opened the door snow came whirling in. Obviously he was calling on me, not Wolfe, since he knew the schedule, and I was glad to see an ex-client who had paid his bill promptly, so I took his hat and coat and put them on the rack, and ushered him to the office and a chair. When we had exchanged a few remarks about the weather, and his health and mine, and Wolfe’s, and he had declined an offer of a drink, he said he saw that Vance’s lawyer was trying a new approach on an appeal, and I said yeah, when you’ve got money you can do a lot of dodging. With that disposed of, he said he often wondered where he would be now if he hadn’t come straight to Wolfe from the DA’s office that day in August.
"Look," I said, "you’ve said that before. I have all the time there is and I enjoy your company, but you didn’t come all the way here through the worst storm this winter just to chew the fat. Something on your mind?"

A RIGHT TO DIE

==> He had no appointment and, looking at him across the doorsill, it didn't seem likely that he would be bringing the first big fee of 1964. But when he said his name was Whipple and he wanted to consult Mr. Wolfe I let him in and took him to the office, because after a long dull day I would welcome Wolfe's glare at me for breaking a rule, and also because he was a Negro. So far as I knew, in their hot campaign for civil rights the Negroes hadn't mentioned the right to consult a private detective, but why not? So I didn't even ask him what the trouble was. In the office, when I put him in the red leather chair near the end of Wolfe's desk, he looked around and then leaned back and closed his eyes. I had told him that Wolfe would be down in ten minutes, at six o'clock, and he had nodded and said, "I know. Orchids." <==
Sitting at my desk, I swiveled when the sound came of the elevator and was facing the door when Wolfe entered. When he was in far enough to see the man in the chair he stopped and turned to me, and the glare was one of his best. I met it square.
"Mr. Whipple," I said. "To consult you."
He held the glare. He was deciding whether to turn and march out, to the kitchen, or to bellow. But suddenly the glare became a frown, and he said, not a bellow, "Whipple?"
"Yes, sir."
He wheeled for a look at the man, circled around his desk to his outsize chair, sat, and aimed the frown at the man. "Well, sir?"

He wheeled for a look at the man, circled around his desk to his outsize chair, sat, and aimed the frown at the man. "Well, sir?"


The man smiled a little and said, "I'm going to make a Speech." He cleared his throat and cocked his head. "The agreements of human society embrace not only protection against murder, but thousands of other things, and it is certainly true that in America the whites have excluded the blacks from some of the benefits of those agreements. It is said that the exclusion has sometimes even extended to murder - that in parts of this country a white man may kill a black one, if not with impunity, at least with a good chance of escaping the penalty which the agreement imposes. That's deplorable, and I don't blame black men for resenting it. But how do you propose to change it?"
He turned a hand over. "I'll skip a little. But if you shield him because he is your color there is a great deal to say. You are rendering your race a serious disservice. You are helping to perpetuate and aggravate the very exclusions which you justly resent. The ideal human agreement is one in which distinctions of race and color and religion are totally disregarded; anyone helping to preserve those distinctions is postponing that ideal; and you are certainly helping to preserve them. If in a question of murder you permit your action to be influenced...."
==> He went on, but I wasn't listening. My eyes were at him, but I wasn't seeing him. I was seeing a small room in the Upshur Pavilion at Kanawha Spa, West Virginia, as it had been late one night many years ago. Wolfe was on a chair not big enough for his seventh of a ton, facing an audience of fourteen colored men, cooks and waiters, seated on the floor. He knew, and so did I, that one of them had a vital piece of information regarding a murder, and for two hours he had been trying to find out which one, with no success. Around two a.m. he tried another angle and made a long speech, and that did it. It loosened up a twenty- one-year-old college boy, Howard University, named Paul Whipple, and he blurted it out. And the man in the red leather chair was delivering, word for word, parts of the speech Wolfe had made that long-ago night. <==
I left Upshur Pavilion and came back to what I was looking at. Should I have recognized him? No. Then he had been young and slim with no extra meat on his face muscles; now he was middle-aged, going bald, with saggy cheeks, wearing cheaters with black rims. But the name, Whipple, should have rung a bell, and it hadn't. It had for Wolfe. I did not like that. I will concede that he is a genius and I am not, but on memory I'll concede nothing.
He stopped - in the middle of a sentence, because that was where he had

 interrupted Wolfe that night. He glanced at me with a little smile, settled back in the chair, and shifted the smile to Wolfe.

"Well, we named our son Dunbar. He's a good enough boy. He has his share of shortcomings, but on the whole he's a pretty good boy. He works for the ROCC. Do you know what the ROCC is?"

Whipple nodded. "That's putting it bluntly, but I know you're always blunt. Yes, I need you." He smiled, more of a smile than before. "I need help on a very confidential matter, and I decided to come to you. I doubt if I can pay what you would normally charge, but I can pay."
"That can wait. I have said I have an obligation. Your problem?"
"It's very... personal." His lips worked. He looked at me and back at Wolfe. "In a way, it's related to what you said that night; that's why I quoted it. I have a son, Dunbar, twenty-three years old. Do you remember that you quoted Paul Laurence Dunbar that night?"
"Certainly."
"Well, we named our son Dunbar. He's a good enough boy. He has his share of shortcomings, but on the whole he's a pretty good boy. He works for the ROCC. Do you know what the ROCC is?"
==> Wolfe nodded. "The Rights of Citizens Committee. I have sent them small <==

 contributions."
"Why?"
A corner of Wolfe's mouth went up. "Come, Mr. Whipple. Another speech to quote?"
"I could use one, or my people could. My son could. He's pretty good at a speech. But he's what I - he's the problem, or rather, he's in the problem. He has got involved with a white girl and he's going to marry her, and I can't talk him out of it. So I need help."

Wolfe made a face. "Not mine," he said emphatically.
Whipple shook his head. "Not to talk to him. To find out what's wrong with her."
"Except for the innate and universal flaws of her sex, there may be nothing wrong with her."
"But obviously there is." His brows were up. "She is - not speaking as an anthropologist - of good family. She is young, attractive, and financially independent. For her to marry a Negro is absurd. Obviously - "

"My dear sir. Instead of another speech I could quote for an hour. Benjamin Franklin: 'A man in a passion rides a wild horse.' Or, by courtesy, a woman. An ancient Latin proverb: 'Ex visu amor.' Loving comes by looking. Pfui. Nothing in nature is absurd, though much is deplorable."
"That's irrelevant."

"Yes." Whipple smiled. "Do you remember that when you asked me how old I was and I said twenty-one, Moulton told me to say 'Sir'? Passion or love is not the point. A white woman taking to a black man, even going to bed with him, there's nothing absurd about that. But not marriage. I say if this Susan Brooke wants to marry my son there's something wrong with her. She has a screw loose. All the difficulties, the snags, the embarrassments, the complications...I don't need to list them for you."
"No."


"She couldn't possibly be a good wife to him, and she ought to know it. There's something wrong with her. It may be something specific in her past, or it may be her basic character. If I can find out what it is I can put it up to my son; he's not a fool. But the finding out - I don't know how, I'm not equipped for it. But you are." He turned his palms up. "So here I am."
==> Wolfe said distinctly, "Pride of race." <==
"What! Who?"
"You, of course. You may not be aware - "
Whipple was moving, up. On his feet, his eyes, half closed, slanted down at Wolfe. "I am not a racist. I see I have made a mistake. I didn't think - "
"Nonsense. Sit down. Your problem - "
"Forget it. Forget me. I should have forgotten you. To accuse me of - "

The remark was not offensive, but I withdraw it because it was pointless. You have been moved to action; what moved you is immaterial. What moves me is the fact that I'm indebted to you and you have dunned me, and I'll pay. But first I have a comment. Will you please sit down?"
"I suppose I'm touchy," Whipple said, and sat.
Wolfe regarded him. "The comment is about marriage. It's possible that Miss Brooke is more realistic than you are. She may be intelligent enough to know that no matter whom she marries there will be the devil to pay. The difficulties, snags, embarrassments, and complications - I use your words, though I would prefer sharper ones - are in any case inevitable. If she marries a man of her own color and class, the grounds for them will be paltry, ignoble, degrading, and tiresome. If she marries a Negro the grounds will be weighty, worthy, consequential, and diverting. I have never met a woman with so much sense, but there may be one. What if it is Miss Brooke?"

"Will you arrange for him to meet Miss Brooke? Perhaps a meal, lunch or dinner, with you, her, and your son? With some plausible pretext?"
He was looking doubtful. "I'm afraid that isn't possible. She knows what I - my attitude. Does Mr. Goodwin have to meet her? And my son?"
"Not necessarily your son. Her, yes. I can't proceed until he has seen her, spoken with her, and if possible danced with her, and reported. This may even settle it. His feeling for attractive young women, his understanding of them, and his talent for gaining their confidence may be all we'll need." He turned. "Archie. Have you a suggestion?"
I nodded. "Sure." He had asked for it. "I meet her, feel her out, understand her, get her confidence, bring her here and install her in the south room, and you seduce her and then marry her. As for the difficulties, snags, embar - "
Whipple cut in. "Mr. Goodwin. You can joke about it, but I can't."
==> I met his eyes. "I wouldn't expect you to, Mr. Whipple. I was merely reacting to Mr. Wolfe's joke about me and attractive young women. But of course I'll have to meet her. He never leaves the house on business. How urgent is it? Have they set a date for the wedding?" <==
"No."
"How sure are you they're not already married?"
"I'm quite sure. My son wouldn't do that. He wouldn't dissemble with me - or with his mother."

s his mother with you on this?"

"No."
"How sure are you they're not already married?"
"I'm quite sure. My son wouldn't do that. He wouldn't dissemble with me - or with his mother."

s his mother with you on this?"
==> "Yes. Completely." He turned to Wolfe. "You said your remark about pride of race was pointless, but you had made the remark. With my wife I suppose it could be called that. Is it pride of race if she wants her son's wife to be a girl, a woman, with whom she can be friends? Real friends? Speaking as an American Negro, as a man, and as an anthropologist, can she expect to get true familial intimacy from a white woman?" <==
"No," Wolfe said. "Nor from a colored woman either if it's her son's wife." He waved it away. "However, you're fixed." He tilted his head to look at the wall clock: forty minutes till dinner. "Since Mr. Goodwin's suggestion isn't feasible, let's see if we can find one. Tell me all you know about Miss Brooke."
I got out my notebook.
It took only half an hour, so there were still ten minutes when I returned to the office after escorting Whipple to the front, helping him on with his coat, handing him his hat, and letting him out. Wolfe sat with his current book, closed, in his hands, gazing at it with his lips tight. He had been cheated out of a full hour of reading.
I stood and looked down at him. "If you expect an apology," I said, "you'll have to expect. When you make personal remarks about me with company present, I react."
His head came up. "Of course. You always do. I'm in the middle of a chapter."

"Since we're being frank, no. Not his face or voice. With me too it was the name." I went on. It's better to keep going after a lie. "Anyway, it's a new slant on civil rights. She has a right to marry the man she loves, and look who's trying to stop her. He had a nerve to begin by quoting that speech."

Yeah. We're really going to tackle it?" "You are."
"You leave it to me?"
"No. We'll discuss it later."
"There isn't much to discuss. No matter what we dig up about her, he'll probably -"

That was Monday, February 24. Forty-two hours later, at one o'clock Wednesday, I had lunch with Susan Brooke at Lily Rowan's penthouse on 63rd Street between Madison and Park.
In the random assortment of facts Whipple had supplied there had been nothing to bite on. She had graduated from Radcliffe four or five years ago, and not long after had come to New York. She was living with her married brother, an electronics engineer, in his Park Avenue apartment, and so was her mother. They were from Wisconsin - Racine, Whipple thought, but wasn't sure. He didn't actually know that she was financially independent; he had assumed it, because for more than two years she had been working for the ROCC as a volunteer, no pay, and she had made cash contributions amounting to $2350. Not office work; she made contacts and arranged fund-raising parties and meetings.
That was about all Whipple knew, except for a couple of dozen useless little details and a few even more useless guesses.
The Lily Rowan idea was of course mine, since she was my friend, not Wolfe's. My first suggestion, Monday evening after dinner, was that I would phone the ROCC office, speak with the executive director, Thomas Henchy, and tell him that Wolfe was considering making a substantial contribution, that he would like to discuss it, and that in my opinion the best person to see him would be Miss

 Susan Brooke because I had heard that she made a good impression with men. That was vetoed by Wolfe on the ground (a) that he would feel committed to a substantial contribution, at least a grand, and (b) that with an attractive young woman I would get farther sooner if he wasn't present. Of course the real ground was that she was a woman. There are many things he likes about the old brownstone on West 35th Street, which he owns: the furniture and rugs and books and soundproofing; the plant rooms on the roof; Fritz Brenner, the chef; the big kitchen; Theodore Horstmann, the orchid nurse; and me, the man and the muscle. But what he likes best is that there is no woman in it, and it would suit him fine if one never crossed the doorsill.
So I suggested Lily Rowan, to whom a grand is peanuts, and that was satisfactory. When I rang her, that evening, she said she didn't like to discuss dirty work on the phone so I had better come in person, and I went, and got back to 35th Street and to bed at a quarter past two. Since I take a full eight hours short of murder, I didn't get to the office Tuesday morning until after Wolfe had come down from his two hours in the plant rooms - nine to eleven. Around noon Lily phoned. Miss Brooke would be there tomorrow for lunch at one o'clock, and I might come earlier for more briefing.
The two miles crosstown and up to 63rd Street is one of my favorite walks, but that Wednesday it took plenty of man and muscle. When it's twenty above and at every corner a snowy blast that has been practicing ever since it left Hudson Bay lowers your chin and clamps your mouth shut and bends you nearly double, you have to grit your teeth to go on by all the handy doors to shops and bars and hotel lobbies. When I finally made it, shook the snow off of my coat and hat under the canopy and in the lobby, took the elevator and left it at the top and pushed the button, and Lily opened the door, I said, "The nearest bed."
She raised a brow, a trick I taught her. "Try next door," she said. She let me by and shut the door. "You didn't walk!"

We linked arms and entered the living room, with its 19-by-34 Kashan rug, a garden pattern in seven colors, its Renoir and Manet and Cezanne, its off-white piano, and its glass doors to the terrace, where the wind was giving the snow a big play. When we sat she poked her feet out, the shins parallel, and muttered, "Antelope legs."

When I rang her, that evening, she said she didn't like to discuss dirty work on the phone so I had better come in person, and I went, and got back to 35th Street and to bed at a quarter past two. Since I take a full eight hours short of murder, I didn't get to the office Tuesday morning until after Wolfe had come down from his two hours in the plant rooms - nine to eleven. Around noon Lily phoned. Miss Brooke would be there tomorrow for lunch at one o'clock, and I might come earlier for more briefing. <==
The two miles crosstown and up to 63rd Street is one of my favorite walks, but that Wednesday it took plenty of man and muscle. When it's twenty above and at every corner a snowy blast that has been practicing ever since it left Hudson Bay lowers your chin and clamps your mouth shut and bends you nearly double, you have to grit your teeth to go on by all the handy doors to shops and bars and hotel lobbies. When I finally made it, shook the snow off of my coat and hat under the canopy and in the lobby, took the elevator and left it at the top and pushed the button, and Lily opened the door, I said, "The nearest bed."
She raised a brow, a trick I taught her. "Try next door," she said. She let me by and shut the door. "You didn't walk!"
"Sure. You could call it walking." I put my hat and coat in the closet. "If they walked up Everest, I walked here."
We linked arms and entered the living room, with its 19-by-34 Kashan rug, a garden pattern in seven colors, its Renoir and Manet and Cezanne, its off-white piano, and its glass doors to the terrace, where the wind was giving the snow a big play. When we sat she poked her feet out, the shins parallel, and muttered, "Antelope legs."

Lily said it would depend, that she voted for Democrats only, in respect to the memory of her father. I arose to pour coffee, but Miss Brooke looked at her watch and said she had an appointment. Lily gestured toward the terrace and said it was a day to ignore appointments, but Miss Brooke said she couldn't, it was a meeting about a school boycott. She gave Lily a healthy thank-you handshake, but not me, which was proper, since I hadn't said definitely that I wasn't a Birchite. As Lily convoyed her to the foyer I filled my cup and took it to the glass doors to admire the weather.
Lily came to join me. "Quite a gal," she said. "Fighting her way through that to talk school boycott. If she's fascinating, it's lucky for me I'm not."
"It's one of your best points," I said, "that you're not fascinating." I put the cup on a plant stand.
"And that I'm rather selfish. Look me in the eye, Escamillo. Take that back about making you secure and happy and comfortable."
"Not me. I merely said a man." "Name one."
==> "Nero Wolfe." <==

Ha. What will you bet I couldn't?"
"Not a dime. I know him, but I know you too. No bet."
"You would have to move out." She had a look in her eye, I would say the look of a tiger stalking a herd of deer if I had ever seen a tiger stalk deer. "We would fire Fritz, and of course Theodore. He would read aloud to me. We would ditch the orchids and take out the partitions in the plant rooms and have dancing parties, and you wouldn't be invited. For lunch we would have peanutbutter-and- jelly sandwiches, and - "
I clapped a palm over her mouth with my other hand at the back of her head. With no effort to break away, she tried to bite. I said, "When you're ready to discuss the subject, shut your right eye."

"Uhuh. I always laugh at your cracks to make you secure and happy and comfortable, but may I skip that one? You're trying to get something on her that will keep that colored man from marrying her. Right?"
"That's the idea."
"Then two things. First, I don't think you'll get anything unless you invent it, and I know you wouldn't. I don't think there's anything to get - anything bad enough to count. Second, if there is, I hope you don't get it through anything you heard here. I couldn't blame you, but I would blame me. If she and that Negro want to get married they may be darned fools, of course I think they are, but it's their lookout. So do me a favor. If you stop it, and something you heard here got you started on what stops it, don't tell me. I don't want to know. That's me. You know?"
"Sure." I looked at my wrist: a quarter to three. "If I had any personal feelings about it they would be about the same as yours, but I haven't. Rights all over the place. She has a right to marry him. He has a right to marry her. The father and mother have a right to butt in, they've been doing it for ten thousand years. Nero

==>  Wolfe has a right to meet an obligation to a man. I have a right to earn my pay by doing what I'm told, providing it doesn't clash with my right to stay out of jail. So I'll run along and drop in at the office of the Parthenon Press, which is only a few blocks from here." <==
"There won't be anyone there. Look at that snow. I can beat you at gin. Don't they send people home?"
I looked. "They might at that. May I use the phone?" She was right. I got an answer, but not from the switchboard girl. Some man told me that everybody had gone. When I hung up Lily called through an open door, "I'm in here. Come on. I have a right to win enough to pay for the lunch."
She did, about.

That was a new experience. Over the years I have checked on a lot of people - a thousand, two thousand - but always after something specific, anything from an alibi to a motive for murder.

==> With Susan Brooke I was simply checking. Because I am interested in me, I would give two bits to know which I would have preferred, to dig up something that would brand her good, or to find nothing at all worth mentioning. At the time I was just doing a job, and enjoying it carefree because there was nothing at stake for Wolfe or me. <==
I spent three days, parts of them, and three evenings at it. It didn't take long to cross off the Parthenon Press lead. She hadn't done her reading at the office, and only three people, two editors and a stenographer, had known her. One of the editors hadn't liked her, but I gathered, from a remark by the stenographer, that he had made a pass at her and missed.
The UN lead took longer; it took half a day to find out where she had worked. It would take another half a day for me to write, and you half an hour to read, all the items I collected.
According to one source, she had got tight at a farewell luncheon for some

 Greek. According to another source, she hadn't. She had been so friendly with a Polish girl that she actually took her to the country for a summer weekend. Three times, or maybe four or five, she had been taken to lunch in the delegates' dining room by a Frenchman with a reputation. I followed that one up a little, but it fizzled out. She had once been seen leaving the building with a Moroccan girl, a Hungarian, and a Swede. And so forth and so on. It was very educational. The UN is wonderful for broadening a man's outlook. For instance, Turkish girls have short legs and Indian girls have flat feet.

==> At ten o'clock Saturday evening I mounted the stoop of the old brownstone, used my key to get in, put my coat and hat on the rack, and went down the hall to the office. Wolfe was behind his desk in the only chair in the world that really suits him, with a book, William Shakespeare, by A. L. Rowse. I stood while he finished a paragraph. He looked up. <==
I spoke. "You know, I don't think I have ever known you to take so long with a book."
He put it down. "I'm reviewing his dating of Cymbeline. I think he's wrong."
"Then let's send it back." I spun my chair around and sat. "I took a Moroccan girl to dinner at Rusterman's. On me. She doesn't dance, so I took her home. Today was merely more of the same, not worth reporting. Tomorrow is Sunday. I don't mind this caper, I'm enjoying it, but it's a washout. I suggest that you tell Whipple that if there's something wrong with Miss Brooke it's buried deep."
He grunted. "You like her."
"Not especially. I told you Wednesday evening that my guess was that she is comparatively clean. It still is."

"Radcliffe."
"Oh. So actually her only background in Racine was her childhood. Her father had Racine background, and how. He was the smartest real-estate operator in southern Wisconsin. He owned this building. The family still does. I'm afraid I can't help you much, Mr. Goodwin. If what you want is dirt, I know I can't."


I had intended to ask him if anything newsworthy had happened to Susan Brooke, or about her, in the summer or fall of 1959, but I didn't. She was the Globe's landlady, and they might be behind on the rent. So I told him I wasn't after dirt specifically, just the picture, whatever it was. He started asking questions about the ROOC and what people in New York thought about Rockefeller and Goldwater, and I answered them to be polite.
==> It was dark when I emerged to the sidewalk, and the wind would freeze anything that was bare. I went back to the hotel and up to my room, where I was expecting company at six-thirty. In Chicago I had called on a man who had traded professional errands with Wolfe now and then. According to him, there was only one in Racine that was any good, by name Otto Drucker, and he had phoned him and made an appointment for me. In my nice warm room I took off my shoes and stretched out on the bed, but soon got up again. After only two blocks of that zero wind I would have been asleep in three minutes. <==
He was punctual, only five minutes late. As I shook hands with him at the door I didn't let my surprise show. I would never have picked him for an operative; he would have looked right at home at the desk of an assistant vice-president of a bank, with his neat well-arranged face and his friendly careful eyes. When I turned from putting his coat and hat on the bed, he asked in a friendly careful voice, "And how is Mr. Nero Wolfe?"
He was almost certainly a distinguished citizen. It had never occurred to me that a private detective could get away with it. Not Nero Wolfe. He's a citizen, and he's distinguished, but a distinguished citizen, no.
It was a very pleasant evening. He liked the idea of eating in the room. When I said I would phone room service for a menu, he said it wasn't necessary because the only things they knew how to cook were roast beef, hashed brown potatoes, and apple pie. If I reported the whole evening for you, you wouldn't enjoy it as much as I did, because mostly we talked shop. Take tailing. He knew all the tricks I had ever heard of, and, because he had been working in Racine for twenty years and everybody knew him, he had had to invent some twists that even Saul Panzer would be glad to use.
But of course the point was Susan Brooke. I didn't mention her until after we had got acquainted and had finished with the meal, which was okay, and the dishes had been taken away. All I told him was that a client was considering taking her

look. So used the phone, got Leamis, and received permission to inspect the back file.
The wind had eased up some, but the cold hadn't, and it pinched my nose. In the Globe building the press had started; there was vibration on the ground floor, and even more on the second, where I was taken to a dim and dusty room and turned over to an old geezer with no teeth, or anyway not enough. He warned me to do no clipping or tearing and led me to a bank of shelves marked 1959.
The light was bad, but I have good eyes. I started at August 7, a week before the date Drucker had named, to see if there was any mention of a Harvard man's arrival or presence in town, but there wasn't. On the fifteenth, there it was, front page. His name was Richard Ault and his home town was Evansville, Indiana. It was front page again on Sunday the sixteenth, but on Monday it was inside and on Tuesday there was nothing. I went on and finished the week but drew blanks, then went back to the first three days and read them again.
There was no hint anywhere of any covering up. The three eyewitnesses had been interviewed, and there were no discrepancies or contradictions. The porch was in plain view from the sidewalk; the two women had seen him with the gun in his hand before he had raised it, and one of them had yelled at him. The man had run across the street and had got to the porch as Mrs. Brooke and Susan emerged from the house. Susan had refused to be interviewed that evening, but had told her story to a reporter Saturday morning and had answered his questions freely.
Even if I had been hell-bent on getting something on her I would have had to cross that off and look elsewhere. I put the papers back where they belonged, told the guardian I had done no clipping or tearing, returned to the hotel, treated myself to a glass of milk in the coffee shop, and went up to bed.
==> I don't know whether I would have looked any further in Racine or not if there had been no interruption. Probably not, since I had learned what was in her mind when she said "then something happened," and that was what had sent me. The interruption woke me up Tuesday morning. I had left a call for eight o'clock, and when the phone rang I didn't believe it and looked at my watch. Ten after seven. I thought, Damn hotels anyway, reached for the phone, and was told I was being called from New York. I said here I am, and was figuring that in New York it was ten after eight, when Wolfe's voice came. <==

Archie?"
"Right. Good morning." "It isn't. Where are you?" "In bed."
"I do not apologize for disturbing you. Get up and come home. Miss Brooke is dead. Her body was found last evening with the skull battered. She was murdered. Come home."
I swallowed with nothing to swallow. I started, "Where was - " and stopped. I swallowed again. "I'll leave - "

It wasn't noon, and it wasn't one o'clock, when I used my key on the door of the old brownstone on West 35th Street. It was five minutes to two. The plane had floated around above a fog bank for half an hour before landing at Idlewild - I mean Kennedy International Airport. I put my bag down and was taking my coat off when Fritz appeared at the end of the hall, from the kitchen, and came.
"Grace a Dieu," he said. "He called the airport. You know how he is about machines. I've kept it hot. Shad roe, fines herbes, no parsley."
"I can use it. But I - "

A roar came. "Archie!"
==> I went to the open door to the dining room, which is across the hall from the office. At the table, Wolfe was putting cheese on a wafer. <==
"Nice day," I said. "You don't want to smell the herbs again so I'll eat in the kitchen with the Times. The one on the plane was the early edition."
We get two copies of the Times, one for Wolfe, who has a tray breakfast in his room, and one for me. I proceeded to the kitchen, and there was my Times, propped on the rack, on the little table where I always eat breakfast. Even when I'm away for a week on some errand Fritz probably puts it there every morning. He would. I sat and got it and looked for the headline, but in a moment was interrupted by Fritz with the platter and a hot plate. I helped myself and took a bite of the roe and a piece of crusty roll dabbed in the sauce, which is one of Fritz's best when he leaves the parsley out.
The details were about as scanty as in the early edition. Susan Brooke's corpse had been found shortly before nine o'clock Monday evening in a room on the third floor of a building on 128th Street, a walk-up of course, by a man named Dunbar Whipple, who was on the staff of the Rights of Citizens Committee. Her skull had been crushed by repeated blows. I already knew that much. Also I already knew what the late city edition added: that Susan Brooke had been a volunteer worker for the ROCC, and she had lived with her widowed mother in a Park Avenue apartment; and that Dunbar Whipple was twenty-three years old and was the son of Paul Whipple, an assistant professor of anthropology at Columbia University. One thing I had not actually known but could have guessed if I had put my mind on it: the police and the district attorney's office had started an investigation.
When the roe and sauce and rolls were where they belonged, and some salad, I refilled my coffee cup and took it to the office. Wolfe was at his desk, tapping his nose with a pencil, scowling at a crossword puzzle. I went to my desk, sat, and sipped coffee. After a while he switched the scowl to me, realized I hadn't earned it, and erased it.
"Confound it," he said, "it's preposterous and insulting that I might lose your services and talents merely through the whim of a mechanism. How high up were you at noon?"

"Any callers? Whipple?"
"No."
"Do you want a report on Racine?" "No. To what purpose?"
"I merely ask. I need a shave. Since there's nothing urgent, apparently, I'll go up and use a mechanism. If I did report I wouldn't have to speak ill of the dead." I left the chair. "At least I won't - "
The doorbell rang. I went to the hall for a look through the one-way glass, saw two men on the stoop, and stepped back in. "Two Whipples, father and son. I have never seen the son, but of course it is. Have they an appointment?"
==> He glared. I stood, but evidently he thought the glare needed no help, so I went down the hail to the front and opened the door. Paul Whipple said, "We have to see Mr. Wolfe. This is my son Dunbar." <==
"He's expecting you," I said, which was probably true, and sidestepped to give them room.
A day or two earlier I would have been glad to meet the Negro specimen that Susan Brooke intended to marry, just to size him up. All right, I was meeting him, and he looked like Sugar Ray Robinson after a hard ten rounds, except that he was a little darker. A day or two earlier he would probably have been handsome and jaunty; now he was a wreck. So was his father. When I started a hand for his hat he let go before I reached it, and it dropped to the floor.
In the office I nodded the father to the red leather chair and moved up one of the

 yellow ones for the son. Dunbar sat, but Whipple stood and looked at Wolfe, bleary-eyed. Wolfe spoke.

"Sit down, Mr. Whipple. You're crushed. Have you eaten?"
That wasn't flip. Wolfe is convinced that when real trouble comes the first thing to do is eat.
Dunbar blurted at Wolfe, "What did you do? What did you do?"
Whipple shook his head at him. "Take it easy, son." He twisted around to look at the chair, saw it there, and sat. He looked at Wolfe. "You know what happened."
Wolfe nodded. "I have read the paper. Mr. Whipple. Many people in distress have sat in that chair. Sometimes I cannot supply advice or services, but I can always supply food. I doubt if you have eaten. Have you?"

Dunbar backed away, came in contact with the rim of the chair seat, bent his knees, and sat. His head went down and his hands came up to cover his face.
Whipple said, "Take it easy, son."

I don't believe that anything I have said or done had any thing to do with the death of Susan Brooke, but if Mr. Wolfe tells me to - I was and am working for him - I'll be glad to report it in full. I think it would be a waste of time. As for my covering up, nuts." <==
Whipple's jaw was working. "I hope you're right, Mr. Goodwin. God knows I do. If I was responsible -" He couldn't finish it.
Dunbar's head came up, his face to me. "I'll apologize." "You don't have to. Skip it."
"But maybe you'll tell me who you saw and what was said. Later. I know I'm not in command of my faculties, I haven't got any faculties. I've had no sleep and I don't want to sleep. I answered questions all night and all morning. They think I killed her. By God, they think I killed her!"
I nodded. "But you didn't?"
He stared. His eyes were in no condition for staring. "My God, do you think I did?"

==> "I know him," the father said. He was looking at Wolfe. "He wanted to come here because he thought... what he said. I didn't know what to think, but I was afraid. I was mortally afraid that I was responsible. Now perhaps I wasn't; I can hope I wasn't. And I wanted to come for another reason. They are going to arrest <==

 him. They think he killed her. They are going to charge him with murder. We need your help."
Wolfe tightened his lips.
Whipple went on. "I came and asked your help when I shouldn't have. That was wrong, and I bitterly regret it. I thought at the time I was justified, but I wasn't. I hated to tell my son about it, but I had to. He had to know. Now I must ask your help. Now it would be right for me to remind you of that speech. 'But if you shield him because he is your color there is a great deal to say. You are rendering your race a serious disservice. You are helping to perpetuate - '"
"That's enough," Wolfe snapped. "It isn't pertinent. It has no bearing on the present situation."

"I don't think. I don't know you. I don't know anything."
"I know him," the father said. He was looking at Wolfe. "He wanted to come here because he thought... what he said. I didn't know what to think, but I was afraid. I was mortally afraid that I was responsible. Now perhaps I wasn't; I can hope I wasn't. And I wanted to come for another reason. They are going to arrest

 him. They think he killed her. They are going to charge him with murder. We need your help."
==> Wolfe tightened his lips. <==
Whipple went on. "I came and asked your help when I shouldn't have. That was wrong, and I bitterly regret it. I thought at the time I was justified, but I wasn't. I hated to tell my son about it, but I had to. He had to know. Now I must ask your help. Now it would be right for me to remind you of that speech. 'But if you shield him because he is your color there is a great deal to say. You are rendering your race a serious disservice. You are helping to perpetuate - '"
"That's enough," Wolfe snapped. "It isn't pertinent. It has no bearing on the present situation."
"Not directly. But you persuaded me to help you by prescribing adherence to the agreements of human society. I was an ignorant boy, immature, and you tricked me - I don't complain, it was a legitimate trick. I don't say this is analogous, but you had a problem and asked me to help, and I have one and I'm asking you to help. My son is going to be charged with murder."
Wolfe's eyes were narrowed at him. "They have questioned him for hours and aren't holding him."
"They will. When they're ready."

"I'll try you anyway. You said they think you killed her. Is that merely your fancy or has it a basis?"
"They think it has a basis, but it hasn't."
"That begs the question. I'll try again. Why do they think it has a basis?"

"Because I was there. Because she and I - we were friends. Because she was white and I'm black. Because of the billy, the club that killed her."
==> Wolfe grunted. "You'll have to elucidate. First the club. Was it yours?" <==
"I had it. It's a club that had been used by a policeman in a town in Alabama to beat up two colored boys. I got it - it doesn't matter how I got it, I had it. I had had it on my desk at the office for several months."
"Was it on your desk yesterday?" "No. Susan - " He stopped. "Yes?"
Dunbar looked at his father and back at Wolfe. "I don't know why I stopped. I've told all this to the police, I knew I had to, because it was known. Miss Brooke had rented and furnished a little apartment on One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Street, and the club was there. She had taken it there."
"When?"
"About a month ago."

"Have the police found your fingerprints on it?"
"I don't know, but I don't think so. I think it had been wiped."
"Why do you think it had been wiped?"

"Have the police found your fingerprints on it?"
"I don't know, but I don't think so. I think it had been wiped."
"Why do you think it had been wiped?"
"Because they didn't say definitely that it had my fingerprints on it."
Fair enough. Apparently he had got control. Answering questions will often do that.
==> "A reasonable assumption," Wolfe conceded. "So much for the means. As for the opportunity, you were there, but there is the question of your prior movements yesterday, say from noon on. Of course the police went into that thoroughly. Tell me briefly. I am examining the official assumption that you killed her." <==


Dunbar was sitting straighter. "At noon I was at my desk in the office. At a quarter to one I met two men at a restaurant for lunch. I was back at the office a little before three. At four o'clock I went to a conference in the office of Mr. Henchy, the executive director. It ended a little after six, and when I went to my room there was a message on my desk. Miss Brooke and I had arranged to meet at the apartment at eight o'clock, and the message was that she had phoned that she couldn't get there until nine or a little later. That was convenient for me because I had a dinner engagement with one of the men who had been at the conference. It was twenty-five minutes past eight when we parted at the subway entrance on Forty-second Street, and it was five minutes past nine when I got to One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Street and entered."
"And discovered the body."
"Yes."

"And discovered the body."
"Yes."
==> Wolfe glanced up at the clock. "Will it jar you to tell me what you did?" <==
"No. She was there on the floor. There was blood, and I got some on my hands and my sleeve. For a while, I don't know how long, I didn't do anything. The club was there on a chair. I didn't touch it. There was no use getting a doctor. I sat on the bed and tried to think, to decide what to do. I suppose you think that wasn't natural, with her there dead on the floor, for me to be worrying about me. Maybe it wasn't, but that's what I did. You wouldn't ever understand because you're white."
"Pfui. You're a man, and so am I."
"That's what you say. Words. I knew I had to face it or do something with - with it. I would have, too, but I just barely had sense enough to know I wouldn't get away with it. It couldn't be done. I went and looked in the phone book for the number of police headquarters and dialed it. That was at twenty minutes to ten. I had been there over half an hour."
"The delay was ill-advised but explicable. You have come to grief, certainly, but a murder charge? What will they do for motive?"
Dunbar stared. "You don't mean that. A Negro and a white girl?" "Nonsense. New York isn't Utopia, but neither is it Dixie."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1646    window = 1641 1651

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74882    window = 74877 74887




"That's right. In Dixie I wouldn't be sitting in a fine big room telling a famous detective about it. Here in New York they're more careful about it; they take their time. But about motive, with a Negro they take motive for granted. He's a shine, he's a mistake, he was born with motives white men don't have. It may be nonsense, but it's the way it is."
"With the scum, yes. With dolts and idiots."
"With everybody. Lots of them don't know it. Most of them up here wouldn't say that word, nigger, but they've got that word in them. Everybody. It's in them buried somewhere, but it's not dead. Some of them don't know they've got it and they wouldn't believe it, but it's there. That's what I knew I'd have to face when I sat there on the bed last night and tried to decide what to do."
==> "And you made the right decision. Disposing of the body, however ingeniously, would have been fatal." Wolfe shook his head. "As for your comments about that word, nigger, its special significance for you distorts your understanding. Consider the words that are buried in you but not dead. Consider even the ones that are not buried, that you use: for instance, 'fat ape.' May I assume that a man who resembles an ape, or one who is fat, or both, could not expect just treatment or consideration from you? Certainly not. The mind or soul or psyche - take the term you prefer - of any man below the level of consciousness is a preposterous mismash of cesspool and garden. Heaven only knows what I have in mine as synonyms for 'woman'; I'm glad I don't know." <==
He turned to the father. "Mr. Whipple. The best service I could render you, and your son, would be to feed you. Say an omelet with mushrooms and watercress. Twenty minutes. Do you like watercress?"
Whipple blinked his bleary eyes. "Then you're not going to help us."
"There's nothing I can do. I can't fend the blow; it has landed. Your assumption that your son will be charged with murder is probably illusory. You're distraught."
Whipple's mouth twitched. "Mushrooms and watercress. No, thank you." His hand went inside his jacket and came out with a checkfold. He opened it. "How much do I owe you?"

Nothing. I owed you."
"Mr. Goodwin's trip. To Racine."
==> "You didn't authorize it. I sent him." Wolfe pushed his chair back and stood up. "You will excuse me. I have an appointment. I'm sorry I undertook that job; it was frivolous. And I deplore your misfortune." He headed for the door. <==
He was fudging. It was 3:47, and his afternoon session in the plant rooms was from four to six.
5
Fifty hours went by.
Like you and everyone else, I have various sources of information about what goes on: newspapers, magazines, radio, television, taxicab drivers, random talk here and there, friends, and enemies. I also have two special ones: Lon Cohen, confidential assistant to the publisher of the Gazette, and a woman who is on intimate terms, not familial, with a certain highly distinguished citizen, for whom I once did a big favor. But the news of the arrest of Dunbar Whipple came from none of those sources; it came from Inspector Cramer of Homicide South, whom I couldn't exactly call an enemy and wouldn't presume to call a friend.
During the two days I had not only read the newspapers but had also phoned Lon Cohen a couple of times to ask if there was anything hot about the Susan Brooke murder that wasn't being printed. There wasn't, unless you would call it hot that her brother Kenneth had socked an assistant district attorney on the beak, or that there was nothing to the rumor that it was being hushed up that she had been pregnant. She hadn't been. Of course a lot was being printed: that her handbag, on a table in the apartment, had had more than a hundred dollars in it; that an expensive gold pin had been on her dress and a ring with a big emerald had been on her finger (I had seen the ring); that she had bought a bottle of wine at a package store, and several items at a delicatessen, shortly before eight o'clock; that her mother was prostrated and inaccessible; that everyone at the ROCC had been or was being questioned; and so on. The News came out ahead on shots of Susan Brooke, with one in a bikini on a Puerto Rico beach, but the Gazette had the best one of Dunbar Whipple. Handsome and jaunty.

I wasn't surprised when, at 6:03 Thursday afternoon, Inspector Cramer showed. I

 had been expecting him or Sergeant Purley Stebbins, or at least a phone call, since Wednesday noon, when Lily Rowan had phoned to tell me she had had an official caller. Of course they had done a routine check on Susan Brooke's recent activities, of course someone at the ROCC had told them about her lunch with Miss Lily Rowan and Lily's contribution to the cause, of course they had called on Miss Rowan, and of course Lily had told the caller about me, since someone else would - for instance, the hallman - if she didn't. So I had been expecting company, and when the doorbell rang and I saw Cramer's burly figure and round red face and battered old felt hat on the stoop, I went and opened up and said, peeved, "You took your time. We've been expecting you for days."
==> He spoke to me as he entered. Sometimes he doesn't; he just tramps down the hall. The fact that he spoke, and even thanked me for taking his hat and coat, showed that he had come not to claim but to ask. When he entered the office, naturally he didn't offer a hand, since he knows that Wolfe is not a shaker, but before he lowered his fanny onto the red leather chair he uttered a polite greeting and actually made a try at being sociable by asking, "And how are the orchids?" <==
Wolfe's brows went up. "Passable, thank you. A pot of Miltonia roezli has fourteen scapes."
"Is that so." Cramer sat and pulled his feet in. "Busy? Am I interrupting something?"
"No, sir."
"No case and no client?"
"Yes. None."

Did I?"
"Sure. We know all about that, including Goodwin's trip to Racine. Since you're out of it, I might as well be frank. He's at the district attorney's office and when he leaves he'll be taken to a cell. He'll be formally charged in the morning. I'll - "
"Murder?"
"Yes. I'll frankly admit that if you had told me you had taken him on I would have expected answers to a lot of questions, and Goodwin would have been wanted downtown. Now he may not have to go." He turned to me. "In your check on Susan Brooke, what did you find out about her relations with Dunbar Whipple?"
==> I looked at Wolfe. He shook his head and looked at Cramer. "If you please. Is the decision definite to hold Dunbar Whipple without bail on a murder charge?" <==
"Yes. That's why I'm here."
"Has he a lawyer?"
"Yes. He's at the district attorney's office now.

Cramer turned both palms up. "Harold R. Oster. A Negro. Counsel for the Rights of Citizens Committee."
Wolfe's eyes came to me. "Archie, get Mr. Parker."
I got the phone. I didn't have to consult the book for either of the numbers, office or home, of Nathaniel Parker, the member of the bar. Knowing he was often at his office after hours I tried that one first and got him. Wolfe took his phone, and I stayed on.
"Mr. Parker? I need some information confidentially. You will not be quoted. Do you know a lawyer named Harold R. Oster?"

"You usually do. Well... confidentially, I would say no. He has ability, no doubt of that, but in my opinion he might take a wrong line in a case where - a Negro killing a white woman. I mean charged with killing her. If I were Dunbar Whipple, I would want a different kind of man. Of course I may be completely wrong, but - "
==> "Enough, Mr. Parker, wrong or not. Thank you. You won't be quoted." Wolfe hung up and turned. "Archie. Did Dunbar Whipple kill Susan Brooke?" <==
I know him so well. Anyone might suppose he was showing off to Cramer, showing him how eccentric and unique he was, but no. He merely wanted to know what I would say. If we had been alone I would have told him that one would get him ten that Dunbar was innocent, but with Cramer there I preferred to skip the odds.
"No," I said.
He nodded. "Get Mr. Whipple."
Before turning to the phone I shot a glance at Cramer. Chin down, eyes narrowed, and lips tight, he was glued to Wolfe. He knows him fairly well too, and he suspected what was coming. It would have cramped Wolfe's style a little if Whipple hadn't been at home, but he was.
He answered the phone. I started to tell him that Mr. Wolfe wanted to speak to him, but Wolfe was at his phone and cut in.

"You usually do. Well... confidentially, I would say no. He has ability, no doubt of that, but in my opinion he might take a wrong line in a case where - a Negro killing a white woman. I mean charged with killing her. If I were Dunbar Whipple, I would want a different kind of man. Of course I may be completely wrong, but - "
"Enough, Mr. Parker, wrong or not. Thank you. You won't be quoted." Wolfe hung up and turned. "Archie. Did Dunbar Whipple kill Susan Brooke?"
I know him so well. Anyone might suppose he was showing off to Cramer, showing him how eccentric and unique he was, but no. He merely wanted to know what I would say. If we had been alone I would have told him that one would get him ten that Dunbar was innocent, but with Cramer there I preferred to skip the odds.
"No," I said.
He nodded. "Get Mr. Whipple."
==> Before turning to the phone I shot a glance at Cramer. Chin down, eyes narrowed, and lips tight, he was glued to Wolfe. He knows him fairly well too, and he suspected what was coming. It would have cramped Wolfe's style a little if Whipple hadn't been at home, but he was. <==
He answered the phone. I started to tell him that Mr. Wolfe wanted to speak to him, but Wolfe was at his phone and cut in.

"This is Nero Wolfe, Mr. Whipple. Can you hear me?" "Yes."
"I owe you an apology. You were right, and I was wrong. I have just learned that your son is being held on a charge of murder. I am convinced that the charge is unfounded. If you want my services on your son's behalf, I offer them without fee. My previous undertaking to discharge my obligation to you was fatuous; I should have said no. Now I say yes."
Silence. Then: "His lawyer phoned an hour ago that he would probably be home by eight o'clock."

"You'll pay nothing. My self-esteem needs repairs. But there's a question: the approval of your son and his lawyer."
"They'll approve. I know they will. But how did you learn - are you sure..."
"Yes. A policeman is sitting here in the chair you sat in. When you have the approval of your son and his lawyer, let me know and I'll proceed. I must talk with you and the lawyer."
"Of course. I knew this - I knew it would happen, but now that - now that - " "Yes. Some time has been lost. Let me know." He hung up and swiveled. Cramer asked, cold and slow, "What kind of a goddam play is this?"
==> Wolfe pinched his nose. "I believe I have never told you of an experience I had years ago at a place in West Virginia. I wanted to leave and come home, and I wanted a certain favor from a certain man. A young colored man made it possible for me to realize both desires. His name was Paul Whipple. I hadn't seen him since until ten days ago - no, eleven. Now I'll even the score." <==

The hell you will. You can't possibly know that Dunbar Whipple didn't kill that girl. The only way you could know that would be if you thought you knew who did kill her."
"I haven't the slightest idea who killed her."
"I don't believe you. It's obvious that when Goodwin was checking on her he dug up something that you intend to use to pull one of your goddam fancy stunts. You're not going to. I told you that if you had taken him on Goodwin would have been wanted downtown, and now I'm telling you that I'm taking you too. To the district attorney." He rose. "If you want it done right, you're under arrest as material witness. Come on."
Wolfe, in no hurry, put his hands on the desk rim to push his chair back, arose, and got the edge of his vest between thumbs and forefingers to pull it down. "We shall of course stand mute and get bail tomorrow. May we have two minutes to call Mr. Parker? Get him, Archie."

I slanted my eyes up at Cramer, waiting politely for permission, since I was under arrest. He stood and breathed for ten seconds. He spoke. "You told Whipple that the charge against his son is unfounded. Let's hear you reply to what I said, that if you say Dunbar Whipple didn't kill her you think you know who did."
"I did reply. I have no idea who killed her." "Then why didn't he?"
"I am not obliged to account for a conclusion I have formed. But I tell you on my word of honor - a phrase I respect, as you know - that the conclusion has no evidential basis. I know nothing of the circumstances that led to the death of Susan Brooke that you don't know; indeed, I know much less than you do. I offer a suggestion. I am now committed to act in the interest of Mr. Whipple, I would like to proceed without delay, and I would rather not spend tonight and part of tomorrow in custody, mute or not. I'm going to ask Mr. Goodwin to type a full report, with all conversations verbatim, of his investigation of Susan Brooke, and I offer to send you a copy of it, with his affidavit. That should satisfy you."
"What about you?"

Dismiss me. All my knowledge of the matter will be contained in Mr. Goodwin's report. Still my word of honor."
"When will I get the report?"
"I can't say. How long will it take, Archie?"
"It depends," I told him. "If you want it all, every word, say forty hours. Three days and evenings. I talked with many people about many things. If you want only what could possibly be relevant, ten or twelve hours should do it. The affidavit could cover it."
"Tomorrow afternoon," Cramer said. "By five o'clock." "Maybe, but no guarantee."
==> He regarded Wolfe, opened his mouth and closed it again, about-faced, and was going. Wolfe raised his voice to tell his back, "We are under arrest!" <==
"Balls," Cramer said without stopping. As I got up and went to the hall to see that he was outside when the door shut, I was thinking that you couldn't blame him for being rude. He was facing the fact that they were slapping the big one on a man that Nero Wolfe had decided to take on. I didn't offer to help him with his hat and coat; it wouldn't have been appreciated. When he was out and the door shut I stepped back in the office. Wolfe was back in his chair, looking sour.
I went to my desk and sat. "At least twelve hours," I said. "I might as well be in jail."
I swiveled, got out paper and carbons, and swung the typewriter around. "What are you doing?" he demanded.
"Starting that damn report."
"Why don't you badger me first?"

 barked at you, "What did you do, what did you do," I thought to myself, so he didn't kill her. If he had killed her of course he would be putting on an act, but that act was just too good. Only a genius could be that good, and I've never seen any genius besides you. Then when he told me I knew who killed her. Then when he apologized to you. Do I have to go on?"
"No. It was manifest. He couldn't possibly have been dissembling. You're aware that the report is required not only for Mr. Cramer. I must have it."
"Sure. Proceeding as usual. Giving me a long, mean, extremely difficult job." I turned and got at the paper and carbons.

It took eleven hours plus, four hours Thursday evening and most of Friday. Thirty-two pages and the affidavit. That may seem slow, but for most of it I had no notes. At a quarter past four Friday afternoon I put it in an envelope with a label addressed to Inspector Cramer, took it to a notary public on Eighth Avenue to have the affidavit made official, and then, in a taxi, to Homicide South on 20th Street. I also took a taxi back. It was a nice sunny winter day for a walk, but the Gazette was on the stands and there was an item in it which I wanted to enjoy at leisure.
==> There had been interruptions. Whipple had phoned late Thursday evening to say that Oster, the lawyer, had been glad to hear that he would have Nero Wolfe's help and had approved on behalf of his client. At eight-thirty Friday morning, already at my desk, I was buzzed by Wolfe on the house phone from his room and instructed to call Lon Cohen and tell him that if he cared to send a reporter to 35th Street we would have an item that might be printable; and furthermore I was told to send the reporter up to the plant rooms if he came between nine and eleven. He came a little after ten, and Fritz took him up in the elevator. That wasn't unprecedented but it was out of the ordinary. It was too bad I couldn't tell Dunbar Whipple that, in the interest of a Negro, Wolfe was making an exception he had rarely made in the interest of any white man. I wondered then, and I still do, whether words had anything to do with it, knowing how he is about words. <==

s he had told me, discussing words one evening at the dinner table, negro means black in Spanish and nero means black in Italian. And he had been born in Montenegro, Black Mountain. Maybe something buried in him but not dead, in his cesspool and/or garden.
Of the other phone calls I need to report only one, shortly after lunch, from Oster, when it was arranged that he and Whipple would come at six o'clock for a conference.
In the cab returning from 20th Street I read the item three times. It was on page 3, with the headline: NERO WOLFE SITS IN. Not bad. About anyone else it would probably have been STEPS IN.
God knows he sits. It went:

==> Nero Wolfe, the well-known private detective, is working on the Susan Brooke murder case. <==
He announced today that he has been engaged by Harold R. Oster, attorney for Dunbar Whipple, who has been charged with the murder (see page 1), to investigate certain aspects of the affair.
According to the record, not one of Wolfe's clients has ever been convicted of murder.
Asked this morning by a Gazette reporter if he didn't feel that in this case he was endangering his record, he replied with a flat no. He said that he has good reason to believe that Dunbar Whipple is innocent, and he is confident that, working with Oster, he will be able to procure evidence that will clear him.
He declined to disclose his reasons for believing that Whipple is innocent or the nature of the evidence he expects to get. But for some people the mere fact that he is willing to have it known publicly that he is engaged in the defense of Whipple will be significant. Others will say that there is always a first time.
No picture of the well-known detective, though there were a dozen shots of him in the Gazette morgue. I'd have to write a letter to the editor.

I went to the kitchen and asked Fritz if he had it, and he said no, Wolfe had phoned down from the plant rooms to bring it up. More out of the ordinary.

ut he always waits until he comes down to the office. As I got the milk from the refrigerator and poured a glass I was thinking that if you stick around long enough you'll see everything.
Whipple and Oster arrived early. One of the many Wolfe-made rules in that house is that when a client and his lawyer are both present the client gets the red leather chair, but that time it wasn't followed. Oster shot a glance around and went straight to it. He was tall and broad, with skin the color of dark honey, the kind Wolfe prefers - I mean honey - and he moved like a man who is in charge and intends to stay in charge. I was curious to see what would happen if Wolfe tried to shift him to the yellow chair.
He didn't bother. The sound came of the elevator jolting to a stop, and he entered. The Gazette was in his hand. He nodded left and right and headed between them for his desk, but Oster was up with a hand out. Wolfe halted, shook his head, said distinctly, "My wrist," and went to his chair.
Oster sat down and asked, "Hurt your wrist?"

Knowing that we would inevitably clash, I thought it well to show you at once that I am arbitrary and contumelious. If there must be a clash, let's have it and see what happens. My initial assumption is that Dunbar WhippIe did not kill Susan Brooke, but that she was killed by someone who works for or with the Rights of Citizens Committee. That is - "

Wolfe ignored him. "I wish to make sure," he told Whipple, "that your son knows I am working for him and approves. Have you told him - "
==> "That's impertinent!" Oster cut in. "You know damn well, Wolfe, that a counselor acts for his client. If you don't, you're a lot more ignorant than a man like you ought to be. I'm surprised. I'm astonished, and I may have to reconsider my acceptance of your offer." <==
Wolfe regarded him. "Are you through, Mr. Oster?" "I said I may have to reconsider."

mean are you through speaking?" "I'm through with that."
"Good. I goaded you deliberately. I'm aware of the status of a counselor. What concerns me is my status. In order to do a satisfactory job for Mr. Whipple, I must begin with an assumption which you will almost certainly reject. Knowing that we would inevitably clash, I thought it well to show you at once that I am arbitrary and contumelious. If there must be a clash, let's have it and see what happens. My initial assumption is that Dunbar WhippIe did not kill Susan Brooke, but that she was killed by someone who works for or with the Rights of Citizens Committee. That is - "
"You're damn right I reject it." Oster turned to WhippIe. "He's impossible. Listen to him. Impossible!"

"You're a bungler," Wolfe said, not clashing, just stating a fact. Oster goggled at him, speechless.

"Even if you repudiate my assumption," Wolfe said, "as the man reponsible for Dunbar Whipple's defense you should want to know why I make it. It's tentative, merely a place to start; I must start somewhere. The most pointed known fact about the murderer is that he knew about that apartment, and that Miss Brooke was there or probably was. Since her money and jewelry were not taken, he was not a random marauder; moreover, he didn't try to pose as one by taking them. I don't suppose there were many people who knew of the apartment; apparently, from accounts and hints in the newspapers, there were very few. In an effort to find them, the most likely place should be tried first. I have a question. Dunbar Whipple is your client. If you could clear him only by exposing the real culprit, and if the culprit were someone connected with the organization of which you are the counsel, and if you had it in your power to expose him, would you do so?"
Of course he had to say yes. He added, "But that's three ifs."
"Not the first one, though I said 'if.' Come, Mr. Oster, let's be realistic. Yesterday at this hour a police inspector was sitting in that chair, and we talked at length. I believe that your client is in grave jeopardy unless we produce a substitute. Don't you?"
"Was it Cramer?"

"That damned Cossack."
==> "Not by definition." Wolfe flipped it aside. "I won't press you for an answer; your reputation for acumen is answer enough." Vinegar, then butter. "Dunbar Whipple entered that apartment shortly after nine o'clock and remained there continuously until the police arrived some forty minutes later; he says so. The only feasible method of proving that Susan Brooke died before he arrived is to produce the person who killed her. Let's find him. The ROCC is not the place to look, certainly. Your report, Archie?" <==
I got it from a drawer. He asked, "You have an extra copy?"
I nodded. "I made three."
"Give it to Mr. Oster. That, sir, is a complete report, omitting nothing that could possibly be pertinent, of the investigation of Susan Brooke undertaken by me at the request of Mr. Paul Whipple. I haven't studied it yet, but I shall. I suggest that you do the same. Any hint it contains, however slight, will of course be considered. But as soon as possible I must see - "
He stopped short. He slapped the desk blotter. "Confound it. I'm a ninny. I haven't asked you: have you in mind a ready and cogent defense?"
Oster was flipping the pages of the report. He looked up. "Not ... I wouldn't say ... not ready, no."

"Have you, Mr. Whipple?"
"No," Whipple said. "Absolutely none. But I have a question. Not just curiosity, my son wants to know, and I told him I'd ask you. A lawyer will defend a man even if he thinks he's guilty, but you won't. You must think, you must be fairly sure, that my son is innocent. He wants to know why."

 "Does it matter?"
"It does to him."
==> "Pfui. Tell him because he's a Negro and Susan Brooke was a white girl. That should satisfy him. To satisfy you: partly the absence of a known motive for him, but mostly what he said and did in this room Tuesday afternoon. Either it was an inspired performance or he is innocent, and I don't think he is inspired. I think he's a callow stripling. Please tell him so." Wolfe went back to Oster. "I tried baiting a hook this morning. Have you seen today's Gazette?" <==
"No."
Wolfe picked it up from his desk and stretched his arm. "Here. It's open to the page. Third column, my name in the headline."
Oster took it and read it, taking his time, and reached to hand it to Whipple. "Damn it, you're worse than arbitrary," he told Wolfe. "You know damn well you should have cleared it with me. Bait? Where's the hook?"
Wolfe nodded. "I'm merely showing you that the assumption you reject is not exclusive. As for the bait and hook, I thought it worth trying. It's barely possible that someone, satisfied and apparently secure because the police have settled on Dunbar Whipple, will be disquieted by the news that I am taking a hand and will do something. Remote, certainly."
"It certainly is. How conceited can you get? Understand this, Wolfe: you're under my direction. I'm glad to have this report; that's fine. But anything you do must first have my approval. Understand?"

Oster smiled, a broad smile. "Listen, Wolfe. You began by trying to get a rise out of me, and you got it. Once is enough. Go soak your head."

"But he..." Whipple let it hang. "I think you should consider it, Harold. Isn't it reasonable, his wanting to see them and ask them questions? It isn't - "
"I have seen them and asked them questions! I know them! Come on! If we need a detective, there are others!"

"You do that, Paul, and you'll get another lawyer, you and Dunbar. I'm warning you. I'm telling you."
"You're being hasty, Harold." "I'm telling you!"
==> "You certainly are." Whipple's head was tilted back. I had his profile, and for the first time I saw in him the cocky college boy at Kanawha Spa years and years back. "I know you're a good lawyer, Harold, but I don't know if you're good enough to get Dunbar out of this trouble. I'm being frank, and I doubt it. If anybody can, Nero Wolfe can. If it has to be you or Nero Wolfe, I'll see Dunbar in the morning and tell him what I think, and he'll agree. I'm sure he will." His eyes went to Wolfe. "Mr. Wolfe, it's not only the impression you made on me long ago when I was a raw kid. I've followed your career. As far as I'm concerned, you're in charge." Back to Oster: "Don't go, Harold. Sit down." <==
Oster was chewing his lip. "It's ridiculous," he said. "I'm an attorney-at-law, a respected member of the bar. He's a - a gurnshoe."
"Mr. Oster," Wolfe said.

What?"
"I suggest that Mr. Whipple's extravagance should be ignored. Let's put it that the legal defense of Dunbar Whipple is in your hands, and the search for evidence to support that defense is in my hands. I knew we would clash, and we have. There are no casualties. Oblige me by sitting down. Naturally I expected, and expect, you to be present at the conference tomorrow evening. If you wish to object to anything I say or do, you have a tongue. You have indeed. I don't wonder that you tried to drum me out; I'm difficult, though not really impossible. If you wish to debate it with Mr. Whipple, you can do so later." He looked at the clock. "No doubt you have information for me, and suggestions, and in less than half an hour it will be dinnertime. If you and Mr. Whipple will dine with us, we'll have the evening for it. Wild duck with Vatel sauce - wine vinegar, egg yolk, tomato paste, butter, cream, salt and pepper, shallots, tarragon, chervil, and peppercorns. Is any of those distasteful to you?"

If you and Mr. Whipple will dine with us, we'll have the evening for it. Wild duck with Vatel sauce - wine vinegar, egg yolk, tomato paste, butter, cream, salt and pepper, shallots, tarragon, chervil, and peppercorns. Is any of those distasteful to you?"
Oster said no.
"To you, Mr. Whipple?" Whipple said no.
"Tell Fritz, Archie."
==> I got up and went to the kitchen. It was a good thing neither of them had said yes, for Fritz was well along with the sauce, as Wolfe had known he would be. He didn't welcome my news. <==
Not that he didn't like guests at meals, but he thought there wouldn't be enough duck. I told him it would do Wolfe good to go easy for a change, returned to the office, and found that Oster was back in the red leather chair, evidently on speaking terms, and Wolfe had a pen and pad of paper, taking notes. I interrupted to ask about drinks, got orders for a martini and a vodka on the rocks, and went to the kitchen to fill them.
Only two kinds of guests ever dine at that table: (a) men for whom Wolfe has personal feelings - there are eight altogether, and only two of them live in or near New York - and (b) people who are involved in his current problem. With both kinds he makes a point of steering the table talk to subjects that he thinks the guests will be interested in; for him, as he once remarked, a guest is a jewel on

cushion of hospitality - a little fancy maybe, but a fine sentiment. As Fritz was serving the mussels I was wondering what it would be for those two. It was William Shakespeare. After the skimpy portions of mussels, in white wine with creamed butter and flour, had been commented on, Wolfe asked them if they had read the book by Rowse. They hadn't. But they were interested in Shakespeare? Oh, yes. Not many lawyers or professors would dare to say no. Of course they were familiar with Othello? They were. I cocked an eye at Wolfe. Surely it wasn't very tactful, with those dinner guests to deliberately drag Othello in.
He swallowed his last bite of mussel. "There's an interesting point," he said. "A question. If the facts were established as they are presented in the play, could Iago, today in the State of New York, be legally charged with murder as an accessory, and be successfully prosecuted?"

"I suggest that Mr. Whipple's extravagance should be ignored. Let's put it that the legal defense of Dunbar Whipple is in your hands, and the search for evidence to support that defense is in my hands. I knew we would clash, and we have. There are no casualties. Oblige me by sitting down. Naturally I expected, and expect, you to be present at the conference tomorrow evening.

I had to hand it to him. Unquestionably Othello concerned a subject in which they were interested, and putting the spot on Iago and a question of law made it discussable. They discussed it up one side and down the other. By the time the duck and trimmings had been disposed of, and Fritz had brought the fig souflle, it looked to me as if Iago was on the ropes.

Fritz answers the doorbell during meals, so when it rang as I started on my souflle I stayed put. It would be Cramer. Having read the report, he had come with questions, and they were welcome, because that was better than being invited to the DA's office. But it wasn't Cramer. The sound of voices came from the hall, Fritz's and another, and then another, not recognized. They stopped. There was no use trying to hear a door closing; not only does Fritz close doors quietly, but also Oster was talking. Fritz appeared, crossed the sill, and told Wolfe, "Two men and a woman, sir." Formerly he would have said two gentlemen and a lady, but Wolfe had stopped that. He went on, "Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Brooke and Mr. Peter Vaughn. In the front room. I told them I thought you were engaged for the evening."

I stood in the alcove at the rear end of the hall, looking through the hole in the wall.
==> On the alcove side it's just a hole, a rectangle with a sliding panel. On the office side it's covered by a picture of a waterfall which you can see through from the alcove. I was seeing through, for a preview of the two men and a woman whom Fritz had conducted to the office after Whipple and Oster had left. Wolfe, standing beside me, had already looked. Kenneth Brooke, in the red leather chair, had his head turned to face the other two, talking with them. He was chunky and solid, not slim like his sister. His wife, in the chair Paul Whipple had occupied before dinner, was a full-sized, positive blonde. I mean positive not as opposed to negative, but as opposed to vague. The other man, Peter Vaughn, of whom I had never heard, in a chair Fritz had moved up, was long and lanky, with a narrow bony face. Wolfe and I had been there, looking and listening, for six or seven minutes, but the listening hadn't helped any. They were discussing a picture on the wall back of Wolfe's desk, not the waterfall. Vaughn thought it was an unsigned Van Gogh, which it wasn't. It had been painted by a man named McIntyre whom Wolfe had once got out of a scrape. <==
Wolfe wiggled a finger, and I slid the noiseless panel shut. He looked a question at me, had I ever seen any of them? I shook my head, and he led the way to the office. Entering, he detoured around Brooke to his desk, and I passed behind the other two to mine. Before he sat he spoke. "I'm sorry you had to wait. Usually I see callers only by appointment, but I make exceptions. You are Susan Brooke's

 brother?"
Brooke nodded. "I am. My wife. Mr. Vaughn. Peter Vaughn. We came upon the spur of the moment. We appreciate - "
"That piece in the Gazette," Mrs. Brooke said. She talked positive too. "We think you're right. We know you're right!"

"Indeed. That's gratifying." Wolfe moved a hand to indicate me. "Mr. Goodwin, my confidential assistant. We are both gratified. We thought you were probably going to say we are wrong. How do you know we're right?"

They all spoke at once, or started to. Mrs. Brooke won. "You tell us," She said, "how you know. Then we'll tell you." She was making eyes at him. "They say ladies first, but we can make exceptions too. This time gentlemen first."
Wolfe's lips were tight. I thought he was going to cut loose, but he held it. He was almost polite. "But madam" he said, "consider my position. I am engaged on behalf of a man who may be put on trial for murder. He may be compelled to present his defense to a judge and jury. To disclose particulars of that defense now to you, to anyone, would be to betray him." He looked at the man beside her. "Who and what are you, Mr. Vaughn? Are you on the staff of the district attorney?"
"No," Vaughn said, "nothing like that. I'm just a - a friend. I sell automobiles - Herons."
He got a case from a pocket, extracted a card, and got up to hand it to Wolfe.
I gave myself a black mark. I had not only heard of him, I had seen him, casually. His father was Sam Vaughn, owner and operator of Heron Manhattan, Inc., which I visited at least once a year, to trade in Wolfe's sedan for a new one.

Brooke nodded. "I am. My wife. Mr. Vaughn. Peter Vaughn. We came upon the spur of the moment. We appreciate - "
"That piece in the Gazette," Mrs. Brooke said. She talked positive too. "We think you're right. We know you're right!"
"Indeed. That's gratifying." Wolfe moved a hand to indicate me. "Mr. Goodwin, my confidential assistant. We are both gratified. We thought you were probably going to say we are wrong. How do you know we're right?"
They all spoke at once, or started to. Mrs. Brooke won. "You tell us," She said, "how you know. Then we'll tell you." She was making eyes at him. "They say ladies first, but we can make exceptions too. This time gentlemen first."
==> Wolfe's lips were tight. I thought he was going to cut loose, but he held it. He was almost polite. "But madam" he said, "consider my position. I am engaged on behalf of a man who may be put on trial for murder. He may be compelled to present his defense to a judge and jury. To disclose particulars of that defense now to you, to anyone, would be to betray him." He looked at the man beside her. "Who and what are you, Mr. Vaughn? Are you on the staff of the district attorney?" <==
"No," Vaughn said, "nothing like that. I'm just a - a friend. I sell automobiles - Herons."
He got a case from a pocket, extracted a card, and got up to hand it to Wolfe.
I gave myself a black mark. I had not only heard of him, I had seen him, casually. His father was Sam Vaughn, owner and operator of Heron Manhattan, Inc., which I visited at least once a year, to trade in Wolfe's sedan for a new one.
Wolfe's head turned. "And you, Mr. Brooke?"
"Does that matter? I'm Susan's brother. I'm an engineer by profession. Electronics. I assure you, we don't want you to betray anyone - quite the contrary."

"What she was like," Mrs. Brooke said.
"Her character, her personality," Brooke said.
"Her quality," Vaughn said. "She couldn't possibly have been... with a black man... that apartment. I was going to marry her."
"Indeed. She was engaged?"
"Well... it was understood. It had been for nearly two years. I was waiting until she had had enough of her - kink."

"Indeed. She was engaged?"
"Well... it was understood. It had been for nearly two years. I was waiting until she had had enough of her - kink."
"Kink?"
"Well - caprice. Do-gooding."
"It wasn't just do-gooding," Mrs. Brooke declared. "I flatter myself that I do a little good myself sometimes. But Susan had to go all-out. Giving them money wasn't enough, and even working with them wasn't enough. She had to have that place right in the middle of the Harlem slums and even eat and sleep there sometimes."
==> Wolfe asked, "Were you ever there - that apartment?" <==
"Yes, I went with Mother Brooke - her mother. She insisted on seeing it. It was terrible - the neighborhood, the dirt and the smell, and the awful people. They don't want to be called niggers, but that's what they are. But the idea that Susan could be ... with one of them... could have one of them with her in that apartment, that's absolutely absurd. She was a lady. She had a kink all right, but she was a lady. So you're perfectly right, that Dunbar Whipple didn't kill her. She was killed by some black hoodlum. Heaven knows there's enough of them."
Wolfe nodded. "Your logic seems sound. I understand the police have considered that possibility and reject it because valuables were there in plain sight, not taken, and Miss Brooke had not been sexually assaulted."

That doesn't prove anything. Something scared him, some noise or something. Or he hadn't intended to kill her and that scared him."
"Quite possible. As a conjecture, certainly admissible. But it will take more than a conjecture to clear Mr. Whipple; he was in the apartment; he had been there more than half an hour when the police arrived. The hoodlum theory is futile unless he is found and established. I'm not sure I understand your position. If, as you said, the idea that Miss Brooke 'could have one of them with her in that apartment' is absurd, how do you account for Mr. Whipple being there?"

"I'm not sure I do."
"Your wife said that you know I'm right."
"She should have said that we hope you're right." Brooke was forward in the chair, leaning forward. "When she showed me that piece in the paper, I said, 'Thank God.' My sister is dead, nothing can be done about that, but what's being printed and said about her - it's killing her mother. My mother. It's so ugly - that apartment and a Negro. If he didn't kill her and you can prove it, that will be different. Maybe he did go there just to talk about her work, and found her dead. That will be different. It might save my mother's life. I guess you know what I'm saying. I'm admitting that it's not impossible that my sister intended to marry a colored man - "

Kenneth! Are you crazy?"
==> "I'm talking, Dolly." He stayed at Wolfe. "I wouldn't like it - who would? - but I <==
admit it's possible. But they weren't married. Were they?" "No."
"Then if he killed her it was - ugly. Sordid and ugly. But if you can prove he didn't kill her, that will be different. I'm repeating myself, but you know what I'm trying to say. It's the murder that counts. If someone else killed her, people will forget about Dunbar Whipple. Even my mother will forget about him - not really forget, I suppose, but it will be different. So we want - I want to know why you say Whipple is innocent."
His wife had been trying to get a word in. She blurted it at him. "You're crazy, Kenneth! Susan would not have married a black man!"
"Oh, skip it, Dolly," he told her. "You know what you said just a month - " "I was just talking!"
"Well, you said it." To Wolfe: "So I want to know. I not only want to know, I want to help. I know you get big fees, and I don't suppose Whipple or his father is very flush. If you'll tell me how it stands, I want to help."

I won't disclose the ground for my conclusion that Mr. Whipple is innocent, but it includes no inkling of the identity of the murderer. You might help with that; you were all close to her. If it was neither Mr. Whipple nor a hoodlum, who was it? Who is better off because she is dead? In mind or body or purse. That's always the question. Don't just shake your heads; consider it. Whose life is easier because hers is ended?"
"Nobody's," Brooke said.
"Pfui. Someone killed her, and someone who knew of that apartment. If you want to help me find him, search your memories. I have no memories; I start empty, and I'll start now. Mr. Brooke, where were you that evening between eight and nine o'clock?"
Brooke just stared at him.

"Good God," Brooke said, still staring.
"You're shocked. So would you be if you killed her. Where were you?"
"I was at my laboratory."

"From seven till nearly midnight. I was there when my wife phoned me about Susan."

"Yes. And before and after."

 "How old is your son?" "Eight."
"Anyone else? A servant?"
"No. The maid was out." She moved abruptly and was on her feet. Her bag dropped to the floor, and Vaughn bent over to get it. "This is insulting," she said. "I'm surprised that you tolerate it, Kenneth. If he won't tell us anything, I'm sorry I suggested coming. Take me home."
She moved.
==> Brooke's eyes went to Wolfe, to me, and to Vaughn. Apparently they were inviting a suggestion but got none. His wife had stepped to the door. Rising, he told Wolfe, "I'm in the phone book, both my laboratory and my home. When I said I want to help I meant it. Come on, Peter." <==
Vaughn thought he was going to say something but vetoed it, and because of his hesitation I reached the hall ahead of them. Mrs. Brooke was at the rack, getting her coat, and I went and offered a hand. She ignored it, gave me a withering look, stood until the men approached, and said, "Hold my coat, Kenneth." I opened the door wide, quick, to let the cold air hit her before she got it on. As they went out and I shut the door I decided to see the eight-year-old son in the near future and ask him what time he had gone to bed on Monday, March 2. No woman can throw a pie at me and keep my good will.
I went to the office and told Wolfe, "Okay, Dolly Brooke killed her because she was going to marry a quote nigger unquote, and how do we prove it?"
He frowned. "I have told you not to use that word in my hearing." "I was merely quoting. It isn't - "
"Shut up. I mean the word 'unquote' and you know it."
I took a good stretch and an unpatted yawn. "Too much sitting and no walk. Six hours at the typewriter. Mrs. Brooke deliberately insulted me on the way out. It was at her suggestion that they came. She wanted to find out how much you knew. A month ago she told her husband that she knew or suspected that Susan

 was going to many a quote nigger end of quotation. She knew where the apartment was; she had been there. She had to kill Susan; it wouldn't have solved the problem to kill Dunbar because Susan would merely have picked another one - the way she saw it. The alibi is piddling. For something as important as a murder you couldn't be blamed for leaving a boy in bed asleep, or even for putting just a touch of pentobarbital sodium in his milk. Or Mother Brooke came and baby - sat, knowing or unknowing. Filicide is no more unheard of than sororicide. What have I left out?"

A lousy weekend.
I finally got to Oster early Monday afternoon, at the office of the ROCC, a whole floor of a building on 39th Street near Lexington Avenue. It wasn't lavish, but neither was it seedy. I was a little surprised to see that the switchboard girl, who doubled in reception, was my color, even a little lighter - a middle-aged female, hair showing some gray, with a chin and a half and a long thin nose, which didn't fit. I learned later that of the total office staff of thirty-four, five were white, and of the five whites, four were volunteers, what Dolly Brooke would call do-gooders.


Oster's room was small, one window, but after a few words he took me down the hall to the corner room of the executive director, Thomas Henchy, and it was quite a chamber, with a few dozen photographs on the walls where the cabinets and shelves left room. I had seen Henchy on television a couple of times, and so have you probably - broad shoulders, cheeks a little pudgy but not flabby, short neck. Color, strong coffee with one teaspoon of cream. He got up to shake hands, and I took a little care with the grip. Men with short necks are apt to be knuckle-crushers.
==> When I left, more than an hour later, the program for the evening was set, with no hard feelings. I had explained that when Wolfe had said "the entire staff" he hadn't meant it literally. He wanted to see only those, who, because of their contacts or relations with Susan or Dunbar, or both, might possibly be able to supply useful information; and the selection would be up to them, Oster and Henchy, in discussion with me. That was satisfactory, and we proceeded to discuss. I had a list in my pocket when I left, and when I got back to the office I typed it for Wolfe: <==
*
THOMAS HENCHY, around 50, executive director. He was courteous but not cordial. He knows it's doing ROOC a lot of harm and he hates it. Possibly thinks Whipple killed her.
HAROLD R. OSTER, Counsel. He had evidently told Henchy that a conference at our office was his idea, and I didn't spoil it.
ADAM EWING, around 40, colored, in charge of public relations, worked closely with Whipple. I met him. Smart and very earnest. Thinks he knows everything, and possibly does. Chips on both shoulders. Light caramel.
CASS FAISON, 45, colored, in charge of fund-raising. Susan Brooke worked under him. I met him. They don't come any blacker. Turns his grin on and off. I wouldn't be surprised if he liked Susan and doesn't like Dunbar. No innuendo intended.

 approve of Susan's cottoning to Dunbar. I didn't go into points like that since I wasn't supposed to, but I got the impression.
MISS BETH TIGER, colored, 21, stenographer. Only Henchy has a secretary, they're shorthanded, but she took all of Dunbar's dictation. Another impression, from a comment by Henchy: she would have been willing to take more than dictation from Dunbar. Didn't meet her.
MISS MAUD JORDAN, white, 50 or more, switchboard and receptionist. She is included chiefly because she took the phone call from Susan that afternoon and put the message on Dunbar's desk that Susan couldn't get to the apartment until nine o'clock. She's a volunteer, hipped on civil rights, another do-gooder, evidently with a private pile since she takes no pay and Henchy mentioned that she gave $500 to the fund for Medgar Evers's children. I saw her entering and leaving. An old maid, spinster to you, who had to be hipped on something and happened to stumble on civil rights or maybe wrongs. My impression, based on my infallible understanding of women under 90.
All of them knew about the apartment. Henchy, Ewing, Faison, and Kallman knew where it was. Oster says he didn't. Jordan knew the phone number. Tiger, I don't know.

==> When Wolfe came down from the plant rooms at six o'clock he picked it up, read it twice, scowled at it for two minutes, put it in a drawer, and picked up his current book. Not Rowse on Shakespeare; The Minister and the Choir Singer, by a lawyer named Kunstler. I had read it and recommended it. At dinner we discussed it and agreed that the New York Police Department and district attorney's office had never made such an awful mess of a case and never would. <==
The evening didn't start off any too well. When four or more are coming for an after-dinner session I equip a portable bar in the kitchen and wheel it into the office, and it was there, by the bookshelves to the left of the safe, when the first one arrived; but twenty minutes later, when they had all come and been seated, and Wolfe entered, I had made no sales. That was remarkable. Out of eight people, at nine o'clock in the evening, you would expect at least two or three to be thirsty enough or bushed enough to want a drink, but they all said no. It couldn't have been because of my manners, offering to serve people of an inferior race. First, two of them were white, and second, when I consider myself

 superior to anyone, as I frequently do, I need a better reason than his skin.
The seating was segregated, not by color but by sex. Wolfe had told me to put Whipple, the client, in the red leather chair, and since he had arrived before Oster there had been no clash.
In the front row of yellow chairs Oster was at the far end from me, then Henchy, Ewing, public relations, and Faison, fund-raising. In the back row were Rae Kallman, Maud Jordan, and Beth Tiger. It was my first sight of the Misses Kallman and Tiger. Kallman, who had more lipstick than necessary on her full lips, would probably be plump in a few years, but now she was just nice and curvy. Tiger was one of those specimens who cannot be properly introduced by details. I'll mention that her skin was about the color of an old solid-gold bowl Wolfe has in his room which he won't allow Fritz to clean, that - if she had been Cleopatra instead of what's-her-name I wouldn't have missed that movie, and that I had a problem with my eyes all evening, since with a group there I am supposed to watch expressions and movements. It was especially difficult because Miss Tiger, nearest me in the back row, was at an angle to my right. My mistake.

MISS BETH TIGER, colored, 21, stenographer. Only Henchy has a secretary, they're shorthanded, but she took all of Dunbar's dictation. Another impression, from a comment by Henchy: she would have been willing to take more than dictation from Dunbar. Didn't meet her.
MISS MAUD JORDAN, white, 50 or more, switchboard and receptionist. She is included chiefly because she took the phone call from Susan that afternoon and put the message on Dunbar's desk that Susan couldn't get to the apartment until nine o'clock. She's a volunteer, hipped on civil rights, another do-gooder, evidently with a private pile since she takes no pay and Henchy mentioned that she gave $500 to the fund for Medgar Evers's children. I saw her entering and leaving. An old maid, spinster to you, who had to be hipped on something and happened to stumble on civil rights or maybe wrongs. My impression, based on my infallible understanding of women under 90.
All of them knew about the apartment. Henchy, Ewing, Faison, and Kallman knew where it was. Oster says he didn't. Jordan knew the phone number. Tiger, I don't know.

The executive director objected. "It takes time."
"Come, sir, is time really so precious? Mine isn't. If yours is, all the more tempting to steal a little."
Henchy's eyes smiled, but he wouldn't let his mouth chip in. "It's a point," he conceded. "Bourbon on the rocks."
With the boss sold, the others came along. Rae Kallman offered to help, and that reduced the loss of time. The only holdout was Maud Jordan, and when the others had been served she made it unanimous by asking for a glass of water. I took gin and tonic because Miss Tiger did. I believe in fellowship.
==> Wolfe put his glass down, half empty, and sent his eyes left, then right. "I suppose all of you know that I am proceeding on the premise that Dunbar Whipple was not implicated in the murder of Susan Brooke. That needs no discussion unless one or more of you challenge it. Do you?" <==
Some shook their heads and some said no.
"Let's make it clear. Will all of you who agree with me on that point please raise your hands?"
As Miss Tiger raised hers, her head turned right. Checking. Two of them, Cass Faison and Rae Kallman, were a little slow. Henchy moved only his forearm, to a forty-five degree angle. "But we're not the jury and you're not the judge," Adam Ewing said.
"The intention, Mr. Ewing, is that it shall never get to a judge and jury." Wolfe's eyes went left and right. "Of course all of you have been questioned separately by the police, except Mr. Oster. For our joint purpose, to clear Mr. Whipple, this joint discussion was preferable, but to avoid confusion let's start with each of you singly. But attend, please; if any of you hear a statement made by another that you challenge or question, say so at once. Intervene. Don't let it pass. Is that understood?"
No one said it wasn't.

"Very well. Mr. Goodwin reports that all of you knew of that apartment, and I am assuming that all of you knew where it was, again excepting Mr. Oster. Any comment?"


"I did." Beth Tiger.

"She wanted to speak to Mr. Whipple, and I said he was in a conference, and she told me to tell him that she couldn't get there until nine o'clock or a little later."
"Can you give me her exact words?"
She frowned, making her long thin nose look longer. "I have tried to. To the police. When I said, 'Rights of Citizens Committee,' she said, 'This is Susan, Maud. Please give me Mr. Whipple.' I said, 'He's in conference in Mr. Henchy's room, the people from Philadelphia and Chicago,' and she said, 'Then will you tell him I won't be able to get there until nine or a little later?' I said, 'I leave at five-thirty. Will it be all right if I leave a message on his desk?' and she said, 'Yes, of course.' She hung up."
==> Wolfe glanced at me, saw that I was getting it in the notebook, and returned to her. "On the next point it's regrettable that you have already been questioned by the police, but it can't be helped. Probably it is now fixed in your mind, but I must ask anyway. How sure are you that it was Miss Brooke speaking?" <==
She nodded. "It was her. They wanted to know if I would swear to it on the witness stand, and I told them I couldn't swear it was her because I didn't see her, but if it was someone imitating her voice I would have to hear her do it again before I would believe it."
"Her using your first name was customary?"
"Yes."
"At the time, as she spoke, you noticed no oddity whatever?" "No. Of course not."
"You say 'of course,' Miss Jordan, because your mind is now fixed. You have committed yourself. That's a pity, since I have no ground at present for a demur." Wolfe looked right and left. "This is patently crucial. If only I had spoken with Miss Jordan before she committed herself to the police. If I assume that Mr. Whipple is innocent, as I do, I must also assume that Miss Brooke did not make that telephone call. Either that or - "

"No," Oster said, "not necessarily. She might have made it and got there earlier

 than she expected to. The question is, did she get there before Whipple, and how long before, and on that there is evidence. She was in that neighborhood, at a package store and a delicatessen, before eight o'clock. So she was there before Whipple came, probably about an hour, and that's the point."
Wolfe was shaking his head. "That is not the point. Take the murderer. Since he was not Dunbar Whipple, call him X. He knew about the apartment and that Miss Brooke would be there early in the evening, so in all likelihood he knew that Mr. Whipple would be there too. Would he have entered - presumably admitted by Miss Brooke - and clubbed her to death if Whipple might come at any moment? I don't believe it. He was done for if Whipple arrived, not only while he was in the apartment, but while he was descending two flights of stairs and leaving the building. I reject it. I think X knew that telephone call had been made and that Whipple would not come until later. Either he knew that Miss Brooke had made the call, or he had himself made it, imitating Miss Brooke's voice - in which case it is she, not he - or he had a confederate who made the call. So, Miss Jordan, we need you for another point. Who besides you knew of that call?"
"Nobody." The crease in her chin and a half was deeper because her jaw was set. "I told you, I took it at the switchboard."

"Did you mention it to anyone?"
"No."
"It came at five-fifteen. Did you write the message on the slip immediately?"
"Yes. I would be leaving in a few minutes."

"Was anyone in Mr. Whipple's room when you went there with it?"

No."
"You put it on his desk in plain sight?"
"Of course. So he would see it. Under a paperweight."
==> Wolfe's eyes went to the executive director. "Mr. Henchy. Dunbar Whipple told me that the conference ended a little after six o'clock. Is that correct?" <==
Henchy nodded. "Five or ten minutes after six."
"Was anyone here present, besides you, at the conference?"
"Yes. Mr. Ewing, Mr. Faison, and Mr. Oster."
"Did any of you four leave the room after half past five, before the conference ended?"
Adam Ewing exploded. "This is poppycock! You grilling us!"

"Yes. Mr. Ewing, Mr. Faison, and Mr. Oster."
"Did any of you four leave the room after half past five, before the conference ended?"
Adam Ewing exploded. "This is poppycock! You grilling us!"
==> Wolfe regarded him. "I believe, sir, you are in charge of what is called 'public relations' for your organization. Surely it is in its interest, if Dunbar Whipple is innocent, to have the murderer exposed and dealt with as soon as possible. You don't want it to be someone now in this room, and neither do I. I have contributed to the Rights of Citizens Committee - how much, Archie?" <==
"Fifty dollars a year for the past seven years." I slanted a glance at Miss Tiger to see if she was impressed. Apparently not.
"But that telephone call is a vital point, and if Miss Brooke made it I must know who might have learned about it. Mr. Oster, I told you that if you wished to object to anything I say, you have a tongue. Do you object to this?"
"No," the lawyer said. "I think it's immaterial, but this isn't a courtroom." "It may be immaterial. Shall I repeat the question, Mr. Henchy?"
"No. I'll answer for myself. I was in the room continuously until the conference ended."
"I wasn't," Cass Faison said. I had him in profile, and the light glancing off his black cheek gave it a high gloss. "I had an appointment and left about a quarter

"I wasn't," Cass Faison said. I had him in profile, and the light glancing off his black cheek gave it a high gloss. "I had an appointment and left about a quarter

 to six."
"Did you enter Mr. Whipple's room?"
"No. I want to say, I doubt if Dunbar Whipple killed her, not with a club like that, but if he did I hope he gets the chair. Whoever killed Susan Brooke, whether he's here in this room or not, I hope he gets it."
==> "So do I," Ewing snapped. "We all do." He aimed his sharp brown eyes at Wolfe. "If Oster doesn't object, I don't. I was out of the room for a few minutes, to go to the men's room, and it may have been after five-thirty. I don't know. I didn't enter Whipple's room, and I knew nothing about the phone call or message." <==
"Then I need not grill you. Mr. Oster, if you don't object, you were at the conference?"
"Yes. Like Mr. Henchy, continuously. I learned about the phone call from Miss Jordan the next morning."
"Miss Kallman. Did you enter Mr. Whipple's room during the specified period?"
"I wasn't there." She put her glass down on the stand between her chair and Maud Jordan's. "I wasn't at the office much. I was usually out most of the day. I was that day." All past tense, though Henchy had told me she was staying on. Probably immaterial.
"Were you with Miss Brooke that afternoon?"

"Yes?"
"I told the police. I often phoned her in the evening, if there was anything to

 report or ask about. That morning she told me she would be at the Wadsworth number that evening, and about half past eight, a little after half past, I dialed that number, but there was no answer."
"The number of the apartment on One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Street?" "Yes."
==> Wolfe grunted. "The police probably assume she hadn't arrived. I assume she was dead. Then you didn't know of her call to the office at five-fifteen?" <==
"No."
"You, Miss Tiger?"
Now it was in order to look at her straight, and that was a relief. I had never seen a package, anywhere, more glomable. With my eyes, which are good, free to stick, I decided that her long lashes were home-grown. She told Wolfe, in a tight low-pitched voice, "I saw the message. There on his desk. When I took some letters for him to sign."
Wolfe's eyes, on her, were precisely the same as when they were on Maud Jordan. Yet he's a man. "Indeed," he said. "Then you might as well tell me where you spent the next three hours."
She didn't object. "I was there until half past six, with the letters he had signed. Then I ate something in a restaurant. Then I went home and studied."

 report or ask about. That morning she told me she would be at the Wadsworth number that evening, and about half past eight, a little after half past, I dialed that number, but there was no answer."
"The number of the apartment on One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Street?" "Yes."
Wolfe grunted. "The police probably assume she hadn't arrived. I assume she was dead. Then you didn't know of her call to the office at five-fifteen?"
"No."

Nothing."
"You were in your room alone that evening?"
"Yes. From eight o'clock on. For a while the police thought I killed her. I didn't. I never left the room, even after the police came. They wanted to take me somewhere to be questioned, but I refused to go unless they arrested me, and they didn't. I know the rights of a citizen. I went to the district attorney's office the next day. I want to ask you something. I have asked Mr. Oster but I'm not sure he's right, and I want to ask you. If a person says she committed a murder she can't be convicted just because she says she did it. There has to be some evidence. Is that true?"
"Yes."
"Then I'll be a witness and say I killed her. Mr. Oster says I would be cross- examined and discredited, but I don't believe it. I can answer any question they ask me. Then he wouldn't be convicted, and I couldn't be. Isn't that true?"
==> Wolfe's lips were tight. He took a deep breath. Henchy and Oster both said something, but he ignored them. He took another breath. "You deserve a frank answer, madam. You are either a female daredevil or a jenny. If you killed her you would be risking disaster; if you didn't kill her, you would be inviting derision. If you killed her, I advise you to say nothing to anyone, particularly me; if you didn't, help me find the man who did. Or woman." <==
"I didn't kill her."
"Then don't be a lackwit. Is that apartment on the third floor directly below your room?"
"No, it's in the rear. I'm at the front."
"Did you hear any unusual sounds that evening between eight and nine o'clock?" "No. The first unusual sounds were after the police came."
"I presume Mr. Whipple knew that you lived there, on the floor above. He told me that he stayed in the apartment until the police arrived - more than half an hour after he discovered the body. It might be thought that at that crisis the impulse to confer with an associate, a friend, so near at hand, would be

"He wouldn't have known. He would have stayed in my room."
"Then I'm as glad as you are that he didn't go to you. This job is knotty enough without that. Archie, the glasses are empty."
As I went to the bar for a bottle of beer and took it to him, a couple of them made remarks that can be skipped, and Miss Kallman got up to help. They all took refills except Miss Tiger. Her glass was still two-thirds full, with the ice gone, but she didn't even want more ice.
By the time the others had been served, Henchy had downed most of his refill, and I put the bourbon bottle on the stand between him and Oster, and he emptied his glass, picked up the bottle, and poured. It was twelve-year-old Big Sandy, which is worth stealing a little time for. As for me, I went to the kitchen and got a glass of milk. I would like to be loyal to Miss Tiger and say that what she didn't want I didn't want, but the truth is that ever since the time I missed an important point because I had had four martinis to be sociable I have limited myself to one dose when I'm working. When I returned to the office with the milk, Oster was speaking:
"... so I didn't object, but it was immaterial. What does it matter who knew of the phone call or the message? Say I saw the message on Whipple's desk. I would know that he probably wouldn't be at the apartment until nine o'clock, but I would also know that Susan wouldn't either. Therefore I wouldn't go there at eight o'clock, to see her or kill her before Whipple came. Therefore it's immaterial."
==> Wolfe nodded and put his glass down. "Obviously, if it were that simple, but it isn't. The telling point is that if you saw the message you knew it was fairly certain that Whipple wouldn't arrive until around nine o'clock. During the two <==

 hours between six and eight you might have learned - no matter how, there are various possibilities - that Miss Brooke had changed her plans and would get there earlier. You might even have met her, by design or accident, and gone to the apartment with her on some pretext."
"Possible." Oster pursed his lips, considering it, then jerked his chin up, and I thought he had decided to take charge. But he only said, "Are you going to ignore the fact that someone besides Miss Tiger knew about the message?"
"No. I was keeping that for later, but if you want it now..." Wolfe's eyes went right. "He means you, of course, Miss Jordan. You left the office at five-thirty. How did you spend the next three hours?"
There was a flash in her eyes that I didn't know she had. "I didn't spend it killing anybody," she snapped.

"Good. Nor, I hope, at any other mischief. You must have told the police; why not tell me? Miss Tiger did."
"Oh, I'll tell you. What I told them. I stopped at three places on the way home to buy some things - a book, and stockings, and cream and bread and pickles - and went home and cooked my supper, and ate it, and read the book until I went to bed."
"What book?"
"The Group. By Mary McCarthy."

==> Wolfe made a face. He had read two chapters and ditched it. "Where do you live?" <==
"I have a little apartment on Forty-seventh Street near Lexington Avenue. I'm alone in the world."
"At least you're aware of it. Many people aren't. Now, madam, a point we haven't dealt with yet. What is your feeling about a Negro marrying a white woman?"
The flash again. "That's none of your business."

My personal business, no. But it's of urgent concern to me as the man hired by Mr. Whipple to find out who killed Susan Brooke. If you have a reason to refuse to answer, I - "

"Then I won't try. Mr. Henchy?"
He cleared his throat. If I had been with him on the bourbon, I would have had to clear mine twice. "On the whole, I approved. Marriage is a very personal matter, but insofar as the interests of the organization were concerned I was in agreement with Mr. Faison. I thought the advantages would outweigh the disadvantages. In my position I must be realistic. Miss Brooke was a very wealthy woman." He reached for his glass.
"And you, Mr. Oster?"
==> The lawyer cocked his head. "You know, Wolfe, I'm sitting here taking it in. I'm giving you all the rope you want. But asking me how I feel about a Negro marrying a white woman - how remote can you get? I'll send you a copy of a magazine with an article I wrote four years ago. Every civilized strain of mankind on earth is the result of interbreeding. Evidently nature approves of it, so I do. I'm not going to indict nature." <==
"You had no special feeling about this particular instance?" "Certainly not."
Wolfe poured beer, emptying the bottle. He put it down and looked left and right. "I admit," he said, "that much of what has been said has probably been a waste of time. I hope it has, for in spite of Miss Jordan's conviction I will not discard the guess that the telephone call was not made by Miss Brooke. I like it; its attractions are many and manifest." His eyes settled on my assistant bartender. "Miss Kailman, you said that Miss Brooke had a five-o'clock meeting that day. Do you know where it was to be held?"
"It was at NYU, but I don't know which building or room." "Can you find out?"
"Yes, easily."
"And the names of some of the people who were there?"

"Can Mr. Goodwin call you in the morning and get Mr. Magnus's address?" "I had better call him. I'm never sure just when I'll be there."
"Will you do so?"

Yes, of course."
"I've talked with Magnus," Oster said. "So have the police, naturally. You won't get anything conclusive, one way or the other."
==> Wolfe was swallowing beer. It was turning into a big beer night, three bottles instead of the usual one or two. He put the glass down and licked his lips. "There's always a chance of a hint, and Mr. Goodwin is good at hints. I can't say about you, but the police were surely satisfied to have it that Miss Brooke made that call, and I am not. If there's any - " <==
The phone rang, and I turned and got it. "Nero Wolfe's resi - " "Saul, Archie. I've got a slice of maybe bacon."
"We could use some. We have company. Hold it."
"Sure."
I pressed a button, rose, detoured around the chairs, passing only eight inches from Miss Tiger's shoulder, went to the kitchen, and got at the phone on my breakfast table.
"Goodwin speaking."

With Saul you don't ask silly questions, such as was she alone going and coming. "All right," I said, "she may not be a murderer, but she's a damn liar. He's finishing up a threebottle session with an integrated audience. One of them is a brown girl, golden brown, whom you'd better never meet if you don't want to be glued. I don't want to be rude, but I have to get back in there. Where are you?"
"A booth. Sixty-fourth and Lexington."
"Where will you be?"
"Home in bed. It's nearly midnight."
"If we don't ring you tonight we will in the morning. Stand by, huh?"
==> He said he would. I cradled the phone and sat a minute looking at it. It was the kind of thing Wolfe hates and I'm not too fond of myself. Trying to find someone or ones who had seen that car in Harlem that evening, granting it had been there, was a job for an army. Facing her with it as a known fact without naming the source would be a waste of breath. I got up, said a word aloud that needn't be in the record, went to the hall, and found that the party was over. Two of them were on their way to the front, and the others were filing out of the office, all but Paul Whipple, who was having a word with Wolfe at his desk. <==
I went to help with coats and hats, and deliberately selected Maud Jordan's, letting one of the others serve Miss Tiger. I didn't want to give her the impression that I was at her beck, let alone her call. Then Paul Whipple came, and I had his ready for him. He was the last one out.

en I went to the office Wolfe had his reading light on and had opened The Minister and the Choir Singer. That was as it should be; he would stay to keep me company while I took things out and straightened up. To go to bed, leaving the mess to me, would sort of imply that I was merely a menial, so he stayed to collaborate. As I entered he looked a question.
I nodded. "Saul. Mrs. Brooke forgets things. Monday evening, March second, around a quarter to eight, she got her car from the garage and brought it back an hour or more later. Saul shelled out twenty dollars to the garage attendant and promised not to reveal the source. No one with her."
He growled. "Confound her."

Meaning he only did the tricky ones. He raised his book, and I started collecting glasses.
Miss Tiger's was still two-thirds full. Wasting good gin, Follansbee's.

==> A problem like Dolly Brooke's lie is plain ornery. Even if we could get the garage man to play along and he said it to her face, a big if, she could say that he was mistaken, it had been another evening, or that she had gone on a personal errand which she preferred to keep to herself; and if she had actually driven to 128th Street and killed Susan Brooke it wouldn't help any to let her know we had caught her in a lie just to show her how smart we were. You might like to know how Nero Wolfe would handle such a problem, but I can't tell you in this particular case because he didn't handle it at all. Luck did. The luck rang the doorbell of the old brownstone at five minutes to ten Tuesday morning. <==


But first William Magnus. Rae Kallman phoned while I was at my breakfast table in the kitchen, on my fourth homemade Creole pork sausage and my third Creole fritter. She had discovered that she had Magnus's phone number in a notebook at home, and she had called him early, to get him before he left. By now he had gone for a day at school. He would have no free time until four- thirty, and we could expect him a little before five. As I resumed with the sausage and fritters I considered the fact that Miss Kallman was cooperating beyond the call of duty; she had promised only to supply his address and phone number. Sometimes - not often, but it does happen - such a little detail has a point. Had she wanted to brief him, and if so, why? A corner of my mind was still considering it in the office as I opened the morning mail.
When luck rang the doorbell at 9:55 I didn't know it was luck, even after I went to the hall and saw him on the stoop. Peter Vaughn was merely the long and lanky specimen who was still trying to hang onto the notion that he had been going to marry Susan Brooke after she got rid of her kink. As a candidate for the tag, at least 100 to 1. But when I opened the door and saw him closer, it was obvious that something really sharp was biting him. His bony face looked even narrower, and he had to unclamp his jaw to speak, to say that he knew Wolfe wasn't available at that hour, but he would rather see me anyway. That was grease, or it wasn't. I took him to the office and moved a chair up to face mine. He sat, clamped his jaw again, and rubbed his eyes, which were red and puffy, first with his fingertips and then with the heels of his palms.
"I haven't slept for four nights," he said.

I nodded. "You look it." Four nights had passed since he had been there with his future in-laws. If I had been Wolfe I would have asked if he had eaten. Being me, I asked, "How about a drink? Or coffee?"
"No, thanks." He tried to eye me, but it was mostly blinks. "I know a couple of men who know about you, and it's because of what they said that I would rather see you than Wolfe. They said you're tough but straight, and you're more human than Wolfe."
"At least I try."
He didn't hear it. He was in the kind of condition when you're so concentrated on what you want to say that nothing anyone else says can get in.

Peter Vaughn was merely the long and lanky specimen who was still trying to hang onto the notion that he had been going to marry Susan Brooke after she got rid of her kink. As a candidate for the tag, at least 100 to 1. But when I opened the door and saw him closer, it was obvious that something really sharp was biting him. His bony face looked even narrower, and he had to unclamp his jaw to speak, to say that he knew Wolfe wasn't available at that hour, but he would rather see me anyway. That was grease, or it wasn't. I took him to the office and moved a chair up to face mine. He sat, clamped his jaw again, and rubbed his eyes, which were red and puffy, first with his fingertips and then with the heels of his palms.
"I haven't slept for four nights," he said.
==> I nodded. "You look it." Four nights had passed since he had been there with his future in-laws. If I had been Wolfe I would have asked if he had eaten. Being me, I asked, "How about a drink? Or coffee?" <==
"No, thanks." He tried to eye me, but it was mostly blinks. "I know a couple of men who know about you, and it's because of what they said that I would rather see you than Wolfe. They said you're tough but straight, and you're more human than Wolfe."
"At least I try."
He didn't hear it. He was in the kind of condition when you're so concentrated on what you want to say that nothing anyone else says can get in.

But first William Magnus. Rae Kallman phoned while I was at my breakfast table in the kitchen, on my fourth homemade Creole pork sausage and my third Creole fritter. She had discovered that she had Magnus's phone number in a notebook at home, and she had called him early, to get him before he left. By now he had gone for a day at school. He would have no free time until four- thirty, and we could expect him a little before five. As I resumed with the sausage and fritters I considered the fact that Miss Kallman was cooperating beyond the call of duty; she had promised only to supply his address and phone number. Sometimes - not often, but it does happen - such a little detail has a point. Had she wanted to brief him, and if so, why? A corner of my mind was still considering it in the office as I opened the morning mail.

"I'm in one hell of a squeeze," he said. "I'm stuck. First I ought to tell you, I don't owe Kenneth and Dolly Brooke anything. They don't owe me anything, either. met them through Susan, about three years ago. I only knew them, I only kept knowing them and seeing them, on account of her. So I don't feel - Wait a minute. I didn't say this is confidential. It is."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 75423    window = 75418 75428


I shook my head. "Not if it connects up with murder. I mustn't make liars of the men who told you I'm straight. Put it this way: nothing you tell me will be disclosed unless it has to be in order to nail a murderer. Everything else is, and will stay, confidential. Is that plain?"
"Yes." A muscle at the side of his neck was twitching. "I suppose... All right. I admit I'm thinking of me. I lied to the police."
"If I had a dime for every lie I've told them I'd be on my yacht in the Caribbean. What is it you don't feel?"
"What?"
"You said, 'I don't feel,' and stopped."
==> "I don't - Oh. Yes. I don't feel that there's any question of loyalty. I don't owe them any loyalty. I said I'm thinking of me, and I am, but the trouble is I have a conscience. That's an old-fashioned word, and I'm not religious, but I don't know what else to call it. That's why I haven't been able to sleep. What I can't stand - You remember, when we were here Friday evening, we tried to get Wolfe to tell us why he thinks that man is innocent, and he wouldn't. I want you to tell me why. Confidentially. Just for me." <==
It was beginning to sound promising. What was eating him might be something we could use, and the odds had at least doubled that he wasn't it. I made an effort. "If it would get you some sleep," I said, "I wish I could tell you. But if I did, people would no longer call me straight. Dunbar Whipple is Nero Wolfe's client, and I work for Nero Wolfe. But look at it. You read that piece in the Gazette. Mr. Wolfe has never taken a murder suspect for a client if he thought there was any chance that he was guilty. He knows Whipple is innocent. So do I. The only way he can prove it is to get the murderer. That's all I can tell you or your conscience."
He kept trying to focus on me without blinking. "I can't stand it," he said, "and I

 don't intend to. An innocent man convicted of murder because I didn't have the guts..." He shut his eyes tight and jerked his head from side to side.
"Look," I said, "let's get down to cases. What did you lie to the police about?"

"About where I was. That evening. I lied to Wolfe too. I wasn't at the club all evening. I left right after dinner and was gone for more than two hours."

My lips parted to say "Where did you go?" but it didn't get out. I don't know what stopped it. You never know where a hunch comes from; if you did it wouldn't be a hunch. I took three seconds to look at it, liked it, and said, "Sure. You went and baby-sat for Dolly Brooke while she went and got her car and went for a ride."
It stopped the blinks. He stared. "How in the name of..."
I grinned at him. "You have just heard a detective detect. I knew that she had got the car from the garage around a quarter to eight and returned about an hour and a half later. I doubted if she would leave an eight-year-old alone in the apartment. You come and make a big point of not owing them any loyalty and then say you lied about where you were that evening. So I detect." I turned a palm up. "Simple. Now that the beans are spilled, let's use the broom. Where did she go in the car?"
He still wasn't blinking. "So you knew. I didn't need... I'm a damn fool. How did you find out?"
"Confidential information. We respect confidences, including yours. Where did - "

"I didn't know it."
"Certainly you did. Only two alternatives. Either Susan was already dead when Dolly arrived, since she didn't answer the door, or she did answer the door and let Dolly in, and Dolly killed her. In either case she wasn't alive at five minutes past nine. Don't tell me you hadn't figured that."
"Of course I had. But it wasn't certain. Sometimes people don't go to the door when there's a knock."
"Nuts. No wonder you had conscience trouble. You think Dolly killed her and you baby-sat for her while she did it."
"I haven't said so and I'm not going to." He was blinking again. If his eyelashes had been wings he would have been around the world by now. He asked, "What are you going to do?"
==> I looked at my watch: 10:43. "Nothing, for seventeen minutes. Mr. Wolfe comes down from the plant rooms at eleven. I would advise - Oh, a question. Did you tell her you were going to spill it?" <==

. It would have been... tough. She would have tried to talk me out of it." "Are you going to tell her you have spilled it?"
"No."
"Good. Don't. I advise you to flop. Now that it's off your chest you can probably do twelve hours. We have an extra room with a good bed. In your condition you might get run over crossing the street."
He shook his head. "I'm going home. God, the sound of that, going home!" He got to his feet and put a hand on the chair back for help. "I don't want Wolfe to see me. I couldn't take him right now. Can't you tell me what you're going to do?"

"I have no idea. Mr. Wolfe is the cook, I only wait on table. As for your lying to the police, forget it. They expect it. If nobody ever lied to them, most of them would have been out of jobs long ago." I rose. "If it has to be that you hear from them, you'll hear from me first."
I touched his arm. "Come along. Get home in one piece if possible."
The guy was just about out on his feet. After I got his coat on him, and his hat, and opened the door, I wanted to convoy him down the stoop, but if he couldn't manage that he would never make it home, so I stood out in the raw March wind and watched him to Tenth Avenue, where he would sooner or later get a taxi headed uptown. Of course the trouble was the let up after getting rid of a ten-ton load.
Even after he had reached the corner I stayed on the stoop, for the air, while I asked myself if I should have kept him for more digging. For instance, granting that Dolly had killed her, had it been planned or offhand? I might have asked him if Dolly was good at mimicking, and if he had ever heard her imitate Susan's voice, perhaps to him on the phone. Wolfe would have. I might have asked him what Dolly had said when she came back, tried to get her exact words. If she had just committed a murder, smashed her sister-in-law's skull with a club, almost certainly her tongue had made some little slip, and probably more than one. I had collected four or five mighthaves when a bellow came from inside.
"What are you doing out there?"

I bellowed back, "Breathing!" went in, shut the door, and followed him to the office. It was useless to try to start conversation until he had put a spray of Phalaenopsis Aphrodite in the vase and glanced through the mail. It's some kind of compulsion. I suspect that he always hopes to find a letter from a collector in Honduras or somewhere, saying that he has found a clear solid blue orchid and is sending it to Wolfe by air, no charge, to show his appreciation for something or other.
It wasn't there that morning. I open the mail. He put it aside and turned to me. "Mr. Magnus?"
"He'll be here this afternoon. Miss Kallman had it all arranged when she phoned while I was at breakfast, very much on the job, which may mean something and may not. But something more interesting; I know where Dolly Brooke went in her car that evening."

"You do."
"Yes, sir. Peter Vaughn came and we talked nearly an hour. He just left. I don't think you need it verbatim, so I'll just tell it."
I did so. Not word for word, but I covered all the points. After the first few sentences he leaned back with his chin down and closed his eyes, as he always does when all he needs is his ears. When I finished, explaining that I had let him go because I was human, as he had said, he held it for another minute and then opened his eyes.

He scowled at me. I scowled back, but his face gives him the advantage. Finding that that wasn't getting us anywhere, he leaned back and closed his eyes, and his lips started working. They pushed out, then drew in, and kept at it - out and in, out and in ... Man at work, or possibly genius at work. I never interrupt the lip act because I can't; he's not there. It may last anywhere from half a minute to half an hour; I always time it, since there's nothing else to do.

at time it was four minutes. He opened his eyes and asked, "Can Saul be here at two o'clock?"
"Yes. I rang him before breakfast. He had a chore for this morning, but he'll be free around noon and will call."
"Tell him two o'clock. Get Mr. Whipple."
==> Everything pertaining to a current operation is kept in a locked drawer, and I had to use a key to get the extension number at the university. Then there was a wait because he was in another room. When I had him, Wolfe got on. Naturally Whipple had questions about last night's meeting, and Wolfe tolerated him as much as he would a client who was going to get a fat bill. Not more. He stopped him by saying he hadn't called to report. <==
"I report only when there has been progress. I called because I need your help. I need two Negroes, and I assume you have Negro friends. Two men neither too young nor too old, preferably between thirty and fifty. Not too light, the blacker the better. Not elegant in appearance; that's essential. Rather roughly dressed if possible. Average intelligence will do, or even below average; no acumen or skill is necessary. I need them here by two o'clock, or two-thirty at the latest. I don't know how long they'll have to stay, but I think not more than two hours, perhaps less. They will be asked to do nothing reprehensible or hazardous; they will take no risk of any kind. Can you supply them?"
Silence for five seconds, then: "I suppose it's something about - for my son?"
"Certainly, since I'm asking your help. There may be a development that will show promise."
"Thank God."
"He is not its source. Can you supply two such men?" "I will. You'd better repeat the specifications."

 minutes and a lot of breath.
I was admitted to Fourteen A, to a foyer bigger than my bedroom, by the lady of the house, the full-sized positive blonde. Since she was now definitely a candidate, she deserved more than mere curiosity. As I disposed of my coat and hat on a chair and followed her through an arch into a room in which a concert- size piano was merely a speck in a corner, I was trying to see a sign of a murderer in her. After all the years I should know better, and I do, but it's automatic and you can't control it.
She crossed to one of two divans at right angles to the fireplace, and when she had sat I took a nearby chair. She looked at me with her round blue eyes as a lady of that much house looks at an article like a private detective and said, "Well?"
"It was just a dodge," I said, "to get up and in." "A dodge?"
==> "Yes. Mr. Wolfe wants to see you. You wouldn't be impressed by the reason he had for deciding that Dunbar Whipple was innocent because it was strictly personal. The same with me. Whipple was in the office for more than an hour last Tuesday, a week ago today, and from what he said and the way he said it we were convinced that he hadn't killed Susan Brooke." <==
She stared. "Just what he said?"
"Right. But now we have a better reason - maybe not actually better, but a different kind. Now we know. Since you stood at the door a while, listening, and heard nothing, and knocked on the door, and stood some more to listen, and knocked again, and got no response, and still heard nothing; and since when you left the building you watched the entrance, and Susan didn't arrive but Whipple did, it's obvious that she wasn't in the apartment alive when he entered. That's simple, isn't it?"
She was fairly good. She had parted her lips, and her frown was okay. But what she said wasn't so hot. She said, "What on earth do you think you're saying? Are you crazy?"
Of course people have word habits, she had asked her husband if he was crazy,

She was fairly good. She had parted her lips, and her frown was okay. But what she said wasn't so hot. She said, "What on earth do you think you're saying? Are you crazy?"
Of course people have word habits, she had asked her husband if he was crazy,

 but she should have done better. "That's wasted, Mrs. Brooke," I said. "Peter Vaughn couldn't handle his conscience, and we have it all from him - that is, his end of it. We have some from others too - people who saw you."
"You're crazy! What could you have from Peter Vaughn?"
==> I shook my head. "Really, it's no good. For his part, corroboration to burn. The hallman and elevator man who saw him come and go, and you go and come, your eight-year-old son - but it shouldn't be necessary to drag him in - the man at the garage. Peter's part is solid. It's the other part that Mr. Wolfe wants to discuss with you. I go on talking to give you time to swallow it. He wants to see you, now, and I came to escort you. The other time you wanted to see him, to find out if he knew that you had gone there that evening. Now it's his turn, he wants to see you. Let's go and get it over with." <==
I thought, as I talked, that she was going to go feminine on me, and so she did. She stretched an arm to put her hand out, but I wasn't close enough for her to touch me without leaving the divan. The feminine was in her eyes, and in her chin as it quivered a little, but that was all, except her saying, "I don't want to go." Pure feminine.
"Of course you don't. So come on." Masculine. I stood up. "You said 'the other part.' What other part?"
"I'm not sure. It's what Mr. Wolfe wants to ask you about. I advise you to come and find out."
"I'm not ... I'll come ... later." She got to her feet, took a step, and put her hand on my arm. "Later?"
"It's already later. Whipple has been in the coop four days, and he's innocent and you know it." I took her arm and turned her, masculine but not rough, and she moved. She said she had to tell the maid and headed for a door in the rear, and I thought she might forget to come back, but no. When she returned she had a new look; she had decided to cope. If I had touched her arm I would have been cold- shouldered. But she permitted me to hold her platinum mink and to open and close the door. Down in the lobby, as the hallman opened that door for us, I told him distinctly,

You may keep that slip of paper for a souvenir," and he almost lost his grip on the door. In the taxi she wasn't talking; she kept her head turned, looking out the window. Undoubtedly she was doing what I had told Wolfe she would have time for, deciding on her line.
The charade began when we entered the hall of the old brownstone. The front door on the left, which is to the front room, was ajar half an inch, so I knew the office was empty, and Saul knew we had arrived. The whole ground floor is soundproofed, including the doors. She preferred to keep her coat, and I took her to the office, to the red leather chair, told her there would be a brief wait, left, closing the door, and proceeded to the alcove at the end of the hail. Wolfe was there by the hole in the wall with the panel opened. He looked a question, and I nodded. If there had been any important departure from the script, either at his end or mine, we would have had to go to the kitchen to discuss it.

If there had been any important departure from the script, either at his end or mine, we would have had to go to the kitchen to discuss it.
I looked at my watch: 3:18. The wait was to be ten minutes from the time we entered the house, at exactly a quarter past. We stood it out. At 3:24 we both got our eyes at the hole, and it was close quarters. For the twentieth time I decided that the hole must be enlarged.
It was an absolutely perfect performance. All three of them, including Saul, had arrived before two o'clock, and I had been present at the briefing, though not at the rehearsing. Simply perfect. At 3:25 the connecting door to the front room opened and they entered, Saul in the lead, and she turned her head to face them. It can't be marked against Saul that he didn't look sinister, he couldn't, with his big nose and flat ears and high sloping forehead. The first Negro was a big husky guy, as black as Case Faison, in a blue sweater and gray slacks that hadn't been pressed since Christmas. The second one was small and wiry, not so black, in a brown suit with light tan stripes, white shirt, and red tie. Neat and clean, but not elegant.
Saul led the way across and stopped at Wolfe's desk, and they lined up there, side by side, facing Dolly Brooke in the red leather chair, ten feet away. For thirty long seconds they stood, no movement, gazing at her. She gazed back. At one point her jaw moved and I thought she was going to speak, but she didn't. Of course Saul was counting the seconds. I have timed him on it and he's never off more than one to a minute. He looked at the other two, and they both nodded.
He nodded back and they filed out, not to the front room but to the hall, closing the door behind them.

I slid the panel shut, no noise, and Wolfe and I went to the kitchen. When the door had swung shut he grunted and said, "Satisfactory."
"Awful corny," I said, "and awful tough. Why she didn't scream or throw something or jump up and run I don't know. I wish I understood women."

"Pfui. Need you report?"
"No. I followed instructions and she reacted more or less as expected. What I need after that is a drink, and I have six or seven minutes." I went to a cupboard for a bottle of Big Sandy and to a shelf for a glass, poured, and took a healthy sip. Fritz, who was at the sink sprinkling watercress, said, 'There's milk in the refrigerator."
"Not when I've just watched three grown men bully a poor little woman." I took a sip.
"She is not little and she may be a murderer."

"She is not little and she may be a murderer."
"Murderess. You mustn't call a female Jew a Jewess, and you mustn't call a female Negro a
Negress, but it's okay to call a female murderer a murderess." I took a sip. "Why?" he demanded.
"Because they resent it. That's another civil right, resenting things. I resent being called a private eye or a hawkshaw, so don't do it." I looked at my watch, took a sip, put the glass on the big table, and told Wolf; "Time's up unless you want to stretch it."
==> "I don't." He moved and I followed. Saul was in the hall, up front. He had let the other members of the cast out and was standing by, to stop her if she decided to duck. Wolfe sent him a nod, which he had coming, and opened the door to the office. <==
Dolly Brooke turned her head, jumped up, and demanded, "Who were those men?"
He circled around her to his desk, sat, and regarded her. "Will you please be

 seated, madam?"
"Tricks," she said. "Tricks! Who were they?"

She sat down, on the edge of the chair. "Who were they?"
"I may name them later, or may not. Obviously they were identifying you as someone they had seen somewhere. It - "
"Where?"
"Let me finish a sentence. Mr. Goodwin has told you of the information furnished by Mr. Vaughn regarding his movements that Monday evening. As evidence of Mr. Whipple's innocence that information was invaluable, but it had a flaw. Faced with it, you might say that the account you gave Mr. Vaughn was an invention; that you had not entered the building; even that you had not driven there. Therefore it was necessary to establish the fact that you had entered the building and approximately the times you entered and left. That has been done. The white man was Mr. Saul Panzer, who has no peer as an investigator. The Negroes were reputable citizens who live in Harlem. For the present I withhold their names; you may learn them later, in a courtroom, if the point becomes an issue."
"Are you..." She let it hang. Her face had taken me along on her trip as she realized she had been flushed out of the tall grass. "You mean they saw me?"
==> Wolfe turned a palm up. "Could I make it any plainer, madam?" <==
He sure could. Me, I would have just said yes. I happen to prefer a straightforward lie to one with curves, but I admit it's a question of personal taste. It isn't that he wants to have an out; he simply likes them fancy.
She looked at me, saw only a manly truth-loving phiz, returned to Wolfe, and took a skip.
"Peter Vaughn," she said with feeling. "I owe this to him." Another skip. "My husband." Still another. "Do the police know?"
"Not yet." Wolfe opened a drawer and took out a document. "I suppose they'll

"Read it," Wolfe said. "I made it as brief as possible." She was a slow reader. I thought she would never finish the first page, and she took even longer with the second. Finally she looked up. "If you think I'm going to sign this," she said, "you're crazy."
"You won't even consider it?" "I will not."

"Get Mr. Cramer, Archie." "Who is Mr. Cramer?"
"A police inspector."
I was at my desk, starting to dial.
"Don't do that!" she yelled. I could use a nicer word, but a yell is a yell. As I went on dialing, she bounced out of the chair, to me, and grabbed my arm and jerked. She turned to Wolfe and presumably was glaring; her back was to me.

"I won't squabble," Wolfe snapped. "You will sign that statement, now, or you will stay until Mr. Cramer comes." He turned his head and roared. "Saul!"
The door opened and Saul was there. "This woman prevented Archie from making a telephone call," Wolfe told him. "Don't let her do it again."
Three men and one poor little woman. Saul advanced. I lifted the receiver, which I had cradled. "Don't," she said. She touched my arm. "Please don't. I'll sign it."

"All three copies," Wolfe said, and I got the two carbons from a drawer and took them to her. As she did each one I took it and gave the signature a look. It

"You won't even consider it?" "I will not."
"Get Mr. Cramer, Archie." "Who is Mr. Cramer?"
"A police inspector."
I was at my desk, starting to dial.
"Don't do that!" she yelled. I could use a nicer word, but a yell is a yell. As I went on dialing, she bounced out of the chair, to me, and grabbed my arm and jerked. She turned to Wolfe and presumably was glaring; her back was to me.
==> "I won't squabble," Wolfe snapped. "You will sign that statement, now, or you will stay until Mr. Cramer comes." He turned his head and roared. "Saul!" <==
The door opened and Saul was there. "This woman prevented Archie from making a telephone call," Wolfe told him. "Don't let her do it again."
Three men and one poor little woman. Saul advanced. I lifted the receiver, which I had cradled. "Don't," she said. She touched my arm. "Please don't. I'll sign it."

He may have been in the third-floor hall, leaving, as you mounted the stairs, and retreated to the floor above, remained there until you departed, and left the building soon after you. Or, bolder or stupider, he may have passed you on the stairs, descending as you mounted. Search your memory. Whom did you see, either while you were in the building, or leaving it after you did, as you stood and watched the entrance?"

==> Yes. No one in the building or leaving it." Wolfe's head turned. "What about it, Archie?" <==
"Possible," I said. "Granting that she didn't enter the apartment, that she stayed in the hall, it was only about twenty minutes. It was between eight-thirty and nine, when people are set for the evening, at the movies or at home or somewhere. It's quite possible."
"Pfui." He had looked at the clock a couple of times, and he looked again. Two minutes to four. He pushed his chair back, rose, and scowled down at her. "You're in a pickle, madam. If you killed her, you're doomed. If you didn't, your chance of escaping a painful and perilous ordeal depends wholly on my competence and wit and luck." He headed for the door, but a step short of it he stopped and wheeled to say, "And Mr. Goodwin's." He turned and went. The sound of the elevator came.
She was looking at me, and from her eyes it seemed likely that she was deciding to go feminine again. Her mouth opened and closed. Finally she said, "You're Mr. Goodman."
I said, "Are you crazy?" She stared.
"Look," I said, "if the best you can do is to tell me what my name is and get it wrong, you may not be crazy but you're pooped. There's absolutely nothing you can do except sign off and stay off." I stood up. "Since I brought you, I suppose I should take you home, but I'm expecting a caller. I'll see you to a taxi." I moved, toward the door, and she got up and came. Saul gave me a wink as I passed. It's his one bad habit.

Like everyone else, including you, I frequently make assumptions on insufficient grounds. All I knew about William Magnus was what Rae Kallman had told me, that he was a student at the NYU law school in Washington Square, and that he had arranged a meeting for Susan Brooke to plug civil rights and the ROCC. So I

 knew what he would be like: earnest and honest, of course, and dedicated; probably underfed, but the fire of freedom in his eyes; either a sweater and unpressed pants, or, if he knew the importance of correct appearance, an almost- clean white shirt and gray tie and a dark gray suit, a little worn but without a spot. Perhaps I should mention that I wouldn't be caught dead in a white shirt except when an evening requires the uniform.
Therefore when the doorbell rang a little before five-o'clock and I went to the hall and saw a handsome halfback in a two-hundred-dollar camel's-hair coat, of course it wasn't Magnus. But it was. I went and opened the door. His handshake was firm and friendly, but not dedicated. His voice was full and friendly, but not pushy. When I turned from hanging the coat up, I saw as much of a custom- made blue-and-yellow-checked shirt as a two-button brown tweed jacket would let me see. When I took him to the office he flopped into the red leather chair as if it belonged to him.
==> That made it complicated, because at my desk I would be twelve feet away, so I went and took Wolfe's chair, and he grinned and said, "You don't belong there, do you?" <==
I gave him the grin back. "I always belong wherever I am." He frowned. "Who said that?"
"I did."
"No, really. You read that somewhere."
"Nope. You fed me a slider and I just happened to connect." He grinned. "Okay, you're on base. Shall I try to pick you off?"
"I might steal on you. Let me toss one. Did Susan Brooke make a phone call at a quarter past five on Monday, March second?"

"I might steal on you. Let me toss one. Did Susan Brooke make a phone call at a quarter past five on Monday, March second?"
He leaned back and crossed his legs. His dark brown socks, with light brown stripes, had set him, or his old man, back four bucks. 'The trouble is," he said, "that when I am asked questions I get an irresistible itch to give trick answers. It's probably a neurosis, you'd better just let me tell it. The cop that tried me first, and the lawyer - what's his name, wait a minute, Oster, that's it - and the assistant district attorney, they all insisted on asking questions, and I'm afraid they got

 somewhat confused. I don't want to confuse you too. I wish you'd tell me who said that about always belonging wherever you are. Or wrote it."
"Damn it, I did. If anyone beat me to it, I don't know who or when or where. Tell me about Susan Brooke and the phone call."
==> "Sure. I'm enjoying this. Nero Wolfe's office." He looked around. "That's the biggest globe I ever saw. Nice rug. Books and books. I'd love to spend a week going through all those files. It would probably teach me more than a year at law school. Anyway, I'm going into politics. I'm going to be governor of New York" Having uncrossed his legs to look around, he crossed them again. "But you want to hear about Susan Brooke." <==
"That was the idea,"
"Did you know her?"
"No. I met her once. Five days before she died."
"I met her a year ago. She was a lovely little dame, but I'm going to wait until I'm thirty to marry. It was on account of her I got onto civil rights. I wanted to help her, and anyway, if you're in politics you're in civil rights whether you like it or not. I set up that meeting for her that day. I am now telling you."
He uncrossed his legs, and his face changed completely. He was working. "It was in a room across the hall from an office used by members of the faculty. There's a phone in the office, extension seven-nine-three, and I had arranged to use it from four-thirty on and pay for the calls. I'm disposing of that factor. Twelve local calls were made on that phone between four-thirty and six-thirty, and I made three of them. Two of my calls were to the ROCC, but neither of them was anywhere near a quarter past five. No record was kept at the switchboard of the numbers called or the exact times. Is that covered?"

"Trick answer. Yes."
"I expected about forty people, and at five o'clock about forty were there, students and three or four faculty members. Only a few were seated. It's a big room, and we were moving around, groups here and there. I didn't call the meeting to order until Susan came, and she was late. I don't know exactly what time she arrived, and apparently no one does. I was over by a window, talking

 with four or five students, and she came and said, 'Here I am, late as usual.' I looked at my watch. Twenty minutes past five. So there it is. To my knowledge, it's possible that she had used the phone across the hall, but did she? I don't know. I have asked around, and I haven't found anyone who does know. Questions."
"I wouldn't dream of asking a question. If I did, it wouldn't be about the phone call; you've wrapped that up. It would be about how long the meeting lasted and when did Susan leave and so on."
==> He grinned. "You know how to handle me. If you go into politics, you can be senator and I'll be governor. The meeting adjourned at six-thirty, but a few of us stuck around a little while. Susan and I left at six-forty. My car was in a nearby garage, and I drove her home. By 'home' I mean the address on Park Avenue where she lives with her mother. I didn't know about the apartment in Harlem. Of course I do now. Everybody does. To finish, we arrived a little after seven, say ten after. That, as they put it in questions, was the last time I saw her alive. Alive or dead. Why did Nero Wolfe decide that Whipple didn't kill her?" <==
I grinned. "You're inviting it."
"Sure. Let's hear it."
"Because he knows you did."
He shook his head. "That's not very good. Try another. What was my motive?"
"You thought she was pregnant, thanks to you, and it would louse up your political career."

"Because he knows you did."
He shook his head. "That's not very good. Try another. What was my motive?"
"You thought she was pregnant, thanks to you, and it would louse up your political career."
"That's a little better. Why wasn't I seen? My superb physique, my noble countenance, why wasn't I noticed there in the middle of Harlem?"
"Burnt cork."
==> He threw his head back and laughed. "Wonderful! You're all right. You be governor and I'll be senator. Does Nero Wolfe think he knows who killed her?" <==
Wolfe wouldn't be down from the plant rooms for nearly an hour, so I permitted him to stay and enjoy himself a while longer. Also he was now a candidate,

 though at the bottom of the list, since he had called Susan a lovely dame and implied that he might have married her if he hadn't had other ideas. Since he was deliberately planning to go into the roughest game on earth, politics, nothing was beyond or beneath him, even clubbing a lovely dame, if he had a good enough reason.
When he had gone I got busy at the typewriter. Wolfe had told Dolly Brooke that it was possible that the police would never know about her trip to Harlem, but it looked to me like very long odds, and it wouldn't hurt to have a record, made while it was fresh, of what had been said, both at her apartment and in the office. If withholding evidence got to be an issue, I would be in it as deep as he was. In the Bastille I would have plenty of time to write my memoirs, and it would be helpful to have notes if I could smuggle them in. I was banging away and had got to where Wolfe said, 'I made it as brief as possible,' by six o'clock, when he came. He went to his desk and sat, and didn't pick up his book, so I swiveled to face him.
"Mr. Magnus?" he asked.

"So," I finished, "in a week of plugging you might find that she made the phone call, but probably you could never prove that she didn't. Oster was right when he said you wouldn't get anything conclusive. It could be that Magnus was in the office across the hall when she came, and heard her make the call, and knew that Whipple wouldn't be there until nine o'clock, and drove her there and killed her, but I doubt it, his skull is not empty. It would be a cinch to check on where he was at a quarter past five."

I glared at him. He had made a monkey of me. One of my main functions, perhaps the mainest, is to ride him if and when he lies down on the job, and he had muzzled me. My intention, of course, had been to dare him to suggest a move, to show how much smarter he was than me, and he knew it.
"Go to hell," I said emphatically and turned to the typewriter and banged.
I don't know how long he would have stalled on that one - a day or a week or forever. At dinner he started on automation. He has always been anti-machine, and on automation his position was that it would soon make life an absurdity. It

already bad enough; on a cold and windy March day he was eating his evening meal in comfortable warmth, and he had no personal connection whatever with the production of the warmth. The check that paid the oil bill was connected, but he wasn't. Soon, with automation, no one would have any connection with the processes and phenomena that make it possible to stay alive. We would all be parasites, living not on some other living organisms but on machines, arrived at the ultimate ignominy. I tried to put up a stiff argument, but he knows more words. We were still at it when we got up to cross to the office for coffee, and were in the hail when the doorbell rang.
==> It was Paul Whipple. Wolfe, seeing him through the one-way glass, let out a growl; he hadn't finished with automation. But it was the client, and besides, since we had no notion of what to do next, we had better see if he had. <==
No. All he had was a question. Being polite, he didn't ask it until Fritz had brought the coffee, and Wolfe had poured and I had passed, and he had taken a couple of sips. The steam dimmed his black-rimmed cheaters, and he got out a handkerchief to wipe them.
"My two friends told me what happened," he said. "They said you didn't tell them not to."
Wolfe was trying to look as if he didn't mind having unexpected company and not succeeding. "I told them they could tell you but no one else."
"They won't. You said there might be a development that would show promise. Did it?"
"Yes and no." Wolfe drank, put his cup down, and took a deep breath. "Mr. Whipple. I intended to reserve this, and if you had telephoned I would have. But you troubled to come, and you have a right to your question. Your son could be out tomorrow. Perhaps on bail, but at liberty."

We were still at it when we got up to cross to the office for coffee, and were in the hail when the doorbell rang.
It was Paul Whipple. Wolfe, seeing him through the one-way glass, let out a growl; he hadn't finished with automation. But it was the client, and besides, since we had no notion of what to do next, we had better see if he had.
==> No. All he had was a question. Being polite, he didn't ask it until Fritz had brought the coffee, and Wolfe had poured and I had passed, and he had taken a couple of sips. The steam dimmed his black-rimmed cheaters, and he got out a handkerchief to wipe them. <==
"My two friends told me what happened," he said. "They said you didn't tell them not to."
Wolfe was trying to look as if he didn't mind having unexpected company and not succeeding. "I told them they could tell you but no one else."
"They won't. You said there might be a development that would show promise. Did it?"
"Yes and no." Wolfe drank, put his cup down, and took a deep breath. "Mr. Whipple. I intended to reserve this, and if you had telephoned I would have. But you troubled to come, and you have a right to your question. Your son could be out tomorrow. Perhaps on bail, but at liberty."
The cheaters dropped to the floor, but the rug is soft. "My God," he said, just loud enough to hear. "I knew it. I knew you could do it."

already bad enough; on a cold and windy March day he was eating his evening meal in comfortable warmth, and he had no personal connection whatever with the production of the warmth.

It is sufficiently persuasive to convince the police that it would be inadvisable to hold your son on a murder charge. But it doesn't give the murderer's name or even hint at it."

Whipple was staring, concentrating. Without his glasses he looked older. "But I don't - If she was dead when he got there..."

Whipple was staring, concentrating. Without his glasses he looked older. "But I don't - If she was dead when he got there..."
"Yes. The information makes that conclusion hard to challenge. I can have him released, probably under bail as a material witness. Then the police will be galled. They will suspect you and your wife, and everyone associated with the Rights of Citizens Committee. They will suspect your son, not of actually doing the deed but of being implicated. He can be conclusively cleared only by producing the murderer, and that will be much more difficult with the police everywhere, harassing everyone, including me. Especially me. I don't want to give them the information I have. I want them to keep your son in custody, satisfied that they have the culprit. You can of course make that impossible. You can tell me that if I withhold the information you'll tell them I have it. If you do, I'll have to give it to them at once and quit. Have I made it clear?"
==> "Yes." Whipple lowered his head. I had seen many people, sitting in that chair, lower or turn their heads when they found how hard it was to use their brains while they were meeting Wolfe's eyes. Seeing the glasses on the floor, he bent over to pick them up, got his handkerchief out again, and rubbed, slow motion. <==
"I won't urge you," Wolfe said.
He looked up. "Oh, you don't have to. I was thinking about my wife. If she knew he could be home tomorrow - but she doesn' have to know." He jerked his shoulders up. "I won't tell her."
He put the glasses on. "The information - will it keep? Can you still use it, if..."
"I can use it at any time. I have it in writing, a signed statement, by the woman your friends saw here this afternoon."
"Will they be involved?" "No."

"As a man you are."
"Why... yes."
"Your son is twenty-one years old. Are you aware that by averting this calamity for him we will be compelling him inevitably to suffer a worse one?"
Very neat. Confronted by a father worried sick about a son locked up for the big one, he had dealt with that in less than a quarter of an hour and steered him to automation; a fresh audience, better than me, since he had had me at dinner. Neat.

As I sat at my breakfast table in the kitchen Wednesday morning, disposing of corn muffins and shirred eggs with sherry and chives, my eyes were on the Times propped on the rack, but they were sharing attention with my ears. If the house phone buzzed it would be Wolfe, in his room, to tell me to come up for instructions. I should have known better. His line <==

out getting answers to questions while brushing his teeth had been merely a way to sneak up on automation. I don't say he had never got an idea while brushing his teeth, but if so it was when we were on something urgent. There was nothing urgent about this. What the hell, Dunbar Whipple was safe and sound, getting three meals a day - though it would have been different if Wolfe had been eating the meals. That would have been urgent.
That Wednesday was about as unsatisfactory a day as I have ever spent, speaking professionally. Wolfe's taking time out from a job was nothing new, far from it, but always before I had had the satisfaction of poking him; as I said, that was one of my main functions. Now I couldn't. I was on record that nobody could do anything, and that day nobody did, for sure. The only action performed or word spoken that had anything to do with the case came around five o'clock when Wolfe was up in the plant rooms fiddling with the orchids. The phone rang, and I said aloud, "Automation again." I lifted the receiver.
"Nero Wolfe's office, Archie Goodwin speaking."
"This is Peter Vaughn. I'm calling now because I knew Wolfe wouldn't be there. I can't take him."

 instance."
"Certainly, I've heard her. I've heard her do Susan making a speech on civil rights. Naturally I didn't like it, but she's good. Listen, something I wasn't going to mention, but I guess I will. I may have something important to tell you a little later. Can I get you there this evening?"
"Yes, but I'm here now. Shoot"
"Well, I - No, I won't. I wouldn't want to - No. Maybe I just imagined it, but I'm going to find out. I may ring you this evening."
"How are you going to find out?"
==> "Oh, ask a few questions. I wish I hadn't mentioned it. It's probably nothing. I want to say I'm damned grateful to you and Wolfe, not telling the police. I was pretty sure you hadn't; they would have been at me. I'm damned grateful." <==
He hung up, and I was grateful to him. He had given me something to nibble at. Was there any chance he was going to produce an item we could work on, and if so, what would it be? It would have to be about Dolly Brooke, since she and Kenneth were his only connection, but it wouldn't be about the item he had just supplied, that Dolly could imitate Susan's voice, since he had asked why I asked. Yet it might. He might have asked why I asked to see if I knew something he knew or suspected. I should have hung on. I rang him. First Heron Manhattan; he hadn't been in today. Then his home; he had just gone out and they didn't know where.
When Wolfe came down from the plant rooms I reported. He listened with his eyes open, showing that he was hearing nothing that called for concentration. It was obvious that he had decided, for some reason too subtle for me to appreciate, possibly because he didn't want to see her again if he could avoid it, that Dolly Brooke wasn't it. When I suggested that it wouldn't hurt to try to find Vaughn and pry it out of him, he said pfui, Mr. Vaughn was manifestly an ass, since he hadn't even had enough gumption to slough his illusion about Miss Brooke. That was a fitting end to the day. I had enough gumption to go up to my room, ring Lucy Valdon, and invite her to dine at Rusterman's. She suggested that we eat at her house instead. Sometimes that suggestion is welcome, and it was then. It was nice and quiet there and we could laugh louder and longer. I certainly needed someone to laugh with. If Vaughn phoned, Wolfe could tell him

 where to get me. I stripped and got under the shower.
My morning fog begins to let little streaks of light through as I sip orange juice, and with my second cup of coffee it's all clear, so when I go to the office around nine-thirty I'm set for the day. But there are exceptions, and that Thursday morning was one. First, it was ten-thirty instead of nine-thirty. Second, I had got home at three o'clock and had had two hours' less sleep than my regulation eight. Third, there was nothing to be set for. If there had been any word from Peter Vaughn it hadn't been worth mentioning, since there had been no note on my desk when I got home. Evidently it was going to be more of the same. I had a notion to go up and get Wolfe's toothbrush and put it on his desk, on top of the mail, but that would only make it worse. I would go for a walk and not be there when he came down. That appealed to me. My watch said 10:52. I went to the kitchen and told Fritz, and to the rack in the hall for my coat, and as I was reaching for it some object dimmed the light from the glass in the door, and I turned. The object was Inspector Cramer. Good. Anything and anybody was welcome, even him, even if he had somehow learned about Dolly Brooke and intended to take us for obstructing justice. I opened the door as he started his hand for the button, and said, "Greetings. I was standing here waiting for you."

The object was Inspector Cramer. Good. Anything and anybody was welcome, even him, even if he had somehow learned about Dolly Brooke and intended to take us for obstructing justice. I opened the door as he started his hand for the button, and said, "Greetings. I was standing here waiting for you."
No comment. He was not only out of sorts, he was out of words. He took his coat off and put it on the bench, dropped his hat on it, marched to the office, looked at his watch, and stood facing the door to the hall. Going to my desk, I had a splendid view of his broad burly shoulders and his king-size fanny, motionless for a good three minutes until Wolfe entered, stopped two steps in, and glared. Cramer wheeled and went to the red leather chair. Wolfe switched the glare to me, and as he went to his desk I said, "There wasn't time to buzz you, he just came." He put a raceme of Vanda suavis in the vase, sat, and started looking through the mail, no hurry.
"Take your time," Cramer said, icy. "Take my time. We've got all day. You're going to tell me every word anyone has said in this room, including you and Goodwin, about the murder of Susan Brooke. Start with Peter Vaughn. How often has he been here, and when, and what was said?"

"Oh, ask a few questions. I wish I hadn't mentioned it. It's probably nothing. I want to say I'm damned grateful to you and Wolfe, not telling the police. I was pretty sure you hadn't; they would have been at me. I'm damned grateful."
He hung up, and I was grateful to him. He had given me something to nibble at. Was there any chance he was going to produce an item we could work on, and if so, what would it be? It would have to be about Dolly Brooke, since she and Kenneth were his only connection, but it wouldn't be about the item he had just supplied, that Dolly could imitate Susan's voice, since he had asked why I asked. Yet it might. He might have asked why I asked to see if I knew something he knew or suspected. I should have hung on. I rang him. First Heron Manhattan; he hadn't been in today. Then his home; he had just gone out and they didn't know where.
When Wolfe came down from the plant rooms I reported. He listened with his eyes open, showing that he was hearing nothing that called for concentration. It was obvious that he had decided, for some reason too subtle for me to appreciate, possibly because he didn't want to see her again if he could avoid it, that Dolly Brooke wasn't it. When I suggested that it wouldn't hurt to try to find Vaughn and pry it out of him, he said pfui, Mr. Vaughn was manifestly an ass, since he hadn't even had enough gumption to slough his illusion about Miss Brooke. That was a fitting end to the day. I had enough gumption to go up to my room, ring Lucy Valdon, and invite her to dine at Rusterman's. She suggested that we eat at her house instead. Sometimes that suggestion is welcome, and it was then. It was nice and quiet there and we could laugh louder and longer. I certainly needed someone to laugh with. If Vaughn phoned, Wolfe could tell him

 where to get me. I stripped and got under the shower.

Second, I had got home at three o'clock and had had two hours' less sleep than my regulation eight. Third, there was nothing to be set for.

Wolfe shook his head. "Nonsense. You're rattled, and that's extraordinary too. We have seen Mr. Vaughn only in our capacity as agents for Mr. Whipple and his lawyer, and you are here in your capacity as Mr. Whipple's legal nemesis.

It is not. There are two points. First, in our talks with Mr. Vaughn, Mr. Goodwin and I were the agents of Mr. Oster, and therefore the communications were privileged. Second, even if they weren't privileged we would reserve them, because we have reason to believe that they have no connection with his death. If the event should prove us wrong we would of course be called to account. However -"

I told it, to Cramer. "He said, 'Listen, something I wasn't going to mention, but I guess I will. I may have something important to tell you a little later. Can I get you there this evening?' I said, 'Yes, but I'm here now. Shoot.' He said, 'Well, I - No, I won't. I wouldn't want to - No. Maybe I just imagined it, but I'm going to find out. I may ring you this evening.' I said, 'How are you going to find out?' He said, 'Oh, ask a few questions. I wish I hadn't mentioned it. It's probably nothing.'"
"Who was he - "
==> "No," Wolfe snapped. "Mr. Goodwin is my agent. Archie, did he give you any hint of whom he was going to question or about what?" <==
"No."
"Have you any notion about it?"
It was obvious he wanted another no, so I supplied it. He turned to Cramer. "Nor have I; but I suspect that his contemplated action led to his death, and so we report the conversation. If you can learn whom he expected to question before I do, you'll get the murderer."
"Damn you," Cramer said, icy again. "Damn you. You already know."
"I do not. I haven't even a conjecture. I have some information you don't have, but I am convinced that it has no bearing on the identity of the murderer. I have

I looked at it for five seconds. "What else?" "Nothing ponderable."
"Okay." I stood up. "I'm taking a leave of absence without pay. Two hours or two days, I don't know."

He nodded. "With luck it will be two hours. Your time would be better spent on Mr. Vaughn, even with Mr. Cramer's legion underfoot." He reached for the little stack of mail.
I blew.
==> I never, in these reports, skimp any step that counts, forward or backward. If I score a point, or if I get my nose pushed in, I like to cover it. But it would be a waste of time and space to tell you, for instance, how the Park Avenue hallman reacted to the fact that this time I could talk, or how Dolly Brooke took the news, news to her, that Peter Vaughn was dead. What matters is that it wasn't a step in either direction, except for me personally, since Wolfe had already crossed her off. In less than two hours I got the kind of alibi you do get sometimes, the kind you file under finished business. At seven-forty Wednesday evening Kenneth and Dolly Brooke had sat down to dinner at the table of another couple in the same apartment house; a little before nine two other couples had joined them for an evening of bridge; and they had quit around one o'clock. I checked it with all three of the women, two in person and one on the phone, and with two of the men. When I got back to the old brownstone, Wolfe was in the dining room, halfway through lunch, and one glance at my face told him how it stood. I took my seat, and Fritz came, and I helped myself to a healthy portion of broiled shad that had been marinated in oil and lemon juice seasoned with bay leaf, thyme, and oregano, and three ladles of pureed sorrel. I took only three ladles because at bedtime I would go to the kitchen, heat the leftover sorrel, spread it on a couple of slices of Fritz's bread, and sprinkle it with nutmeg. Serve with a glass of milk. Have a spoon handy to salvage the puree that dribbles onto the plate when you bite. <==
When we went to the office neither of us mentioned Dolly Brooke. I merely said, as I sat, "I'll deduct twenty-two dollars for the two hours."
He grunted. "I prefer not to share the cost of this performance. I'm paying a debt." He flipped a hand to dismiss it. "Presumably Mr. Vaughn telephoned from his home."
"Only presumably. When I rang his home about half an hour later I was told he had just gone out, by a maid, on a guess."
"Where does he live?"

He wouldn't have said that, especially the 'important,' if he merely had some wild idea. He was going to follow up something he had seen or heard. Satisfactory?"
"Yes, but you haven't moved."
"I move now. What or who is the point. What would be eating him when he caught up on sleep? He had got Dolly Brooke off his conscience, and now two questions were nagging him: who killed Susan, and had she been emotionally involved - his words - with Dunbar Whipple, or hadn't she? As for who killed her, he thought it possible, maybe probable, that Dolly Brooke had, but that was merely an unanswered question that other people were working on. It was the second question that really hurt, and he wanted to know."

gestured. "All right, where would he go? In a way he was a simple, direct kind of guy, and he might have gone straight to Dunbar Whipple, but he was in the can. There was no point in going to Dolly Brooke; he had heard all she had to say, he knew she didn't really know, whether she had killed Susan or not. There were only two possibilities, as far as he knew: Whipple's father and mother, or the people at the ROCC. That's where he went. To Paul Whipple, or the ROCC, or both. I suggest that you phone Whipple, and if you get a no, I go to the ROCC and ask Maud Jordan what time Peter Vaughn got there yesterday."
==> Wolfe's shoulders went up an eighth of an inch and down again. "It can do no harm. Even if -" <==
The doorbell rang. I went to the hall for a look, turned my head to tell Wolfe, "Whipple," and proceeded to the front. It was a pleasant walk, those dozen steps; I was absolutely certain that I had more than made up for the two hours I had wasted on Dolly Brooke. What else could have brought Whipple in the middle of a working day? When I opened the door and offered a hand I'm afraid I overdid it a little. I am not a knuckle-crusher, but I do have a grip, and I guess he felt it. I took him to the office, and I hope I wasn't smirking as he took the red leather chair and told Wolfe he had come instead of phoning because he had to tell him something that might make trouble for people that they didn't deserve. Wolfe asked what people, and Whipple raised a hand to adjust his glasses. Cheaters are useful that way; they give you an excuse for moving your eyes and taking a few seconds to pick words.
"You may not know," Whipple said. "That young man, Peter Vaughn, has been murdered."
Wolfe nodded. "I do know."
"His body was found in a parked car. He was shot."
"Yes."

"You could tell me to quit."
"I don't want you to quit!" His voice rose, almost a shriek, and he clamped his teeth on his lip. In a moment he went on. "You'll have to make allowances. When I first came to you my nerves were none too good, and now I can't control them." His head jerked up. "This is childish. Yesterday he came to me, Peter Vaughn, and asked me to tell him what I knew of the relations that existed between my son and that girl, Susan Brooke. He wasn't - "
"What time yesterday?"
"In the morning. He was at the college waiting when I arrived. He wasn't very intelligent, was he? I told him I knew nothing about it beyond the fact of their association in their work, that I could neither confirm nor deny any of the things that have been printed. What else could I say? He was insistent, but so was I, and he left. Then during the lunch hour I received a phone call from Tom Henchy of the ROCC. He said that Peter Vaughn had been there and had insisted on seeing him and some of the others, and he wanted to know what I had told him.
Then today, about an hour ago, Tom Henchy phoned - again. He told me that Peter Vaughn had been murdered last night, and he asked me to say nothing to anyone about his having been at the ROCC yesterday. He said they had agreed that it would be inadvisable to mention it, and they didn't want me to. I said I would call him back, and I did, in a few minutes. During those few minutes what was mostly in my mind was what you said to us that night at Kanawha Spa. That was about murder too. I called him and told him I had decided I must tell you. He wanted me to come or meet him somewhere and discuss it, but I wouldn't. I came here. There it is. I hope to heaven..."
==> He let it hang and left the chair. "I don't expect you to say anything, I don't want you to." He turned and was going, but Wolfe's voice stopped him. <==
"If you please! Who knows about this?"
"No one. I haven't told anybody, not even my wife."

t even about his coming to you?"
"No. And I won't. You must excuse me. It has been painful, telling you this.

"No one. I haven't told anybody, not even my wife."

"No. And I won't. You must excuse me. It has been painful, telling you this.
Very painful." He went.
==> I was on my feet, but Wolfe shook his head at me and I stayed put. My stepping to the hall for a look after the sound came of the front door closing was automatic, a habit ever since the day a bozo shut it from inside and stood near the open office door for half an hour, listening to us discuss his affairs. <==
I stepped back in. "Do I bother to sit?"
A corner of Wolfe's mouth was up. "You know, Archie, the most revealing manifestation of your self-esteem is not an action but an exclusion. You never crow. Nevertheless, accept my compliments."
"With pleasure. I won't deduct the twenty-two bucks. Do I sit down?" "No. Bring them."
"Now?"
"Yes. Mr. Cramer might get to them at any moment."

"I know I can't, confound it. I owe all this to that outlandish trip to Kanawha Spa."

"I did indeed. Bring them. Everyone Mr. Vaughn saw or spoke with, no
exceptions. First ring Saul. We need him immediately."
As I went and started dialing, I was figuring whether it was the fourth time in history he had permitted his afternoon session with the orchids to be gummed up or only the third.

==> Maybe I seldom crow, and I'm all for self-esteem, but I have some flaws, and one of them showed when I walked into the office of the ROCC and crossed over to Maud Jordan at the switchboard and asked, "What time did Peter Vaughn get here yesterday morning?" That had been my suggestion to Wolfe just before Paul Whipple rang the doorbell, and using it verbatim appealed to one of my flaws, I'm not sure which one. <==
It wasn't answered. She looked down her long thin nose at me and asked, "Whom do you wish to see?"
I didn't press her, since Whipple had made it unnecessary. I told her Mr. Henchy, and it was urgent. She used the phone and told me to go on in, and as I went down the hall Harold R. Oster appeared in the doorway of the corner room. I would have preferred to have Henchy alone because lawyers always complicate things, but didn't make an issue of it. He didn't offer a hand, and neither did Henchy when Oster nodded me in and closed the door. Neither of them nodded me to a chair.
I said, standing, to Henchy at his desk, "Paul Whipple has told Nero Wolfe - not on the phone, in person - what he told you he would, about Peter Vaughn, and Mr. Wolfe wants to see you. Now. Everybody who spoke with Vaughn yesterday."
"Sit down," Oster said.
"I'd just have to get up again to go with you. You realize it's urgent. There's no telling how soon the cops will get here, and then you won't be available. If no one here knows where you've gone you won't be available to them for a while. If you think I'm pushing, I am."

He merely wanted to inquire about Dunbar Whipple and Susan Brooke, how intimate they had been. He insisted on it and he was a damned nuisance.

Vaughn called me on the phone at ten minutes past five yesterday afternoon and said something that makes it extremely probable that he was murdered because of something that happened when he was here.

"You'd better consider fast." I stood up. "I don't know how long Mr. Wolfe will hold on."
"I'm going." Henchy got to his feet. His pudgy cheeks were sagging. "I'm going to see him. You too, Harold."

"And the others," I said. "Everyone who spoke with Vaughn, even one word. Including Miss Jordan. Do you want to leave them here to deal with the cops if

"Do I describe him wrong?" she asked Henchy.
"Yes," Oster said. "Within reason."
I made another suggestion, that they go ahead and I would take another elevator and also another taxi. You may think I was overdoing it, but I knew darned well what would happen the minute Cramer learned that Vaughn had gone there, if it

 was still office hours. I was pleased to find that there was room in my skull for still another suggestion, even though I had to veto it - the suggestion that one of them, namely Miss Tiger, might ride with me. It was nice to know that even in a crisis I didn't totally exclude consideration of such matters as companionship. I admit it was a factor that she had not yet given the slightest indication that she was aware that I was human.
==> But I rode alone, and as my cab pulled up in front of the old brownstone I was afraid there would be more delay. It was five minutes past four, and it was at least even money that Wolfe had gone up to the plant rooms. Three of them were standing at the foot of the stoop steps, and the other three were climbing out of their taxi. I paid the hackie and went and led the way up, and as I reached the top the door was opened by Saul Panzer. "Mr. Henchy to the office," he told me, "and the others to the front room." <==
Lawyers can be pests and often are. Eight people in the end of that hall disposing of coats are a crowd, and when I got Henchy separated and started him down the hall to the office, there somehow was Oster, moving like a man who intends to stay in charge. I thought, What the hell, it will be simpler to use the connecting door, and let him come; and sure enough, he went straight to the red leather chair, stood in front of it, and told Wolfe, "Whipple's not here to interfere this time. You'll listen to me."
Relieved that Wolfe was there and my errand was done, I sat down and got my notebook and pen. Let him do the reacting.
He didn't crane to look up at Oster but focused on Henchy, who was in one of the yellow chairs Saul had moved up. "This is going to be unpleasant for all of us," he said. "Has Mr. Goodwin made the situation clear?"
Henchy nodded. "Clear enough so we're here. We came."
"You'll listen to me," Oster said, in charge. "We want to know what Vaughn said

"Yes," Oster said. "Within reason."
I made another suggestion, that they go ahead and I would take another elevator and also another taxi. You may think I was overdoing it, but I knew darned well what would happen the minute Cramer learned that Vaughn had gone there, if it

 was still office hours. I was pleased to find that there was room in my skull for still another suggestion, even though I had to veto it - the suggestion that one of them, namely Miss Tiger, might ride with me. It was nice to know that even in a crisis I didn't totally exclude consideration of such matters as companionship. I admit it was a factor that she had not yet given the slightest indication that she was aware that I was human.
But I rode alone, and as my cab pulled up in front of the old brownstone I was afraid there would be more delay. It was five minutes past four, and it was at least even money that Wolfe had gone up to the plant rooms. Three of them were standing at the foot of the stoop steps, and the other three were climbing out of their taxi. I paid the hackie and went and led the way up, and as I reached the top the door was opened by Saul Panzer. "Mr. Henchy to the office," he told me, "and the others to the front room."
==> Lawyers can be pests and often are. Eight people in the end of that hall disposing of coats are a crowd, and when I got Henchy separated and started him down the hall to the office, there somehow was Oster, moving like a man who intends to stay in charge. I thought, What the hell, it will be simpler to use the connecting door, and let him come; and sure enough, he went straight to the red leather chair, stood in front of it, and told Wolfe, "Whipple's not here to interfere this time. You'll listen to me." <==
Relieved that Wolfe was there and my errand was done, I sat down and got my notebook and pen. Let him do the reacting.
He didn't crane to look up at Oster but focused on Henchy, who was in one of the yellow chairs Saul had moved up. "This is going to be unpleasant for all of us," he said. "Has Mr. Goodwin made the situation clear?"
Henchy nodded. "Clear enough so we're here. We came."
"You'll listen to me," Oster said, in charge. "We want to know what Vaughn said
to Goodwin on the phone yesterday. What you say he said."

Wolfe slanted his head back. "Mr. Oster. I don't ask you to sit because I don't want you to. You will join the others in the front room. I am no longer acting in cooperation with you; henceforth my only commitment is to Mr. Paul Whipple. With me your status is now, to use a cant term, that of a murder suspect." He pointed. "That door."

Oster made a noise, part snort and part snarl. He sat.
"That crap," he said. "The Great White Whosis. I'm a member of the bar, and what are you?"
Wolfe regarded him. "I really can't blame you. If I were a Negro I would have been locked up long ago - or I would be dead. You actually believe that your skin color and mine are factors in my treatment of you. Pfui. I'm not a troglodyte. Archie, the relevant portion of your telephone conversation with Mr. Vaughn yesterday afternoon."

I recited it for them as I had for Cramer, but slower and emphasizing "important," and adding at the end that he hadn't rung again. Henchy was frowning at me, concentrating. Oster was looking skeptical, but he was getting it. Wolfe spoke.
"Those were the last words, for us, from Mr. Vaughn. 'It's probably nothing.' But unfortunately for him it wasn't. It's a conclusion, more than an assumption, that he was going to see again someone he had seen earlier, or at least explore some suspicion resulting from an earlier contact. It's possible that that contact had not been at your office, but I know of none other he might have made relevant to the fate of Susan Brooke, and I doubt if the police do. It's also a conclusion, not lightly to be abandoned, that he was killed by the person who killed Miss Brooke. Do you reject that, Mr. Oster?"
"Reject it, no. If he said what Goodwin says he did."
"For me that is not moot. If it is for you, it will be a soliloquy. Are you willing to
tell me what Mr. Vaughn said to you yesterday, and what you said to him?" "He said nothing, and neither did I."

"No. Next question, where was I last evening? If you have a right to ask any questions at all, which I don't concede, you have a right to ask that. I'll answer it by saying that I can't produce witnesses for the entire evening and night. I wouldn't, for you, but anyway I couldn't."
"Few people could. Now, sir, I'm sure you would like this to be as brief as possible, and you can help. While I talk with Mr. Henchy you can explain to the others - "
"I'm staying right here."
"No. You're leaving, if not the house, the room. You - "
"I'm staying in this chair."
==> Wolfe's head turned. "Archie, you'll need Saul to help remove him; he's of a size. Since it must be done by force, put him out of the house." <==
"You wouldn't," Oster said.
I was up. "I have the build for it," I said, "but you'll be surprised to feel Saul Panzer in action. He's the Little White Whosis." I moved.
"Now wait a minute," Henchy said. "Harold, I don't like this. I don't think it's necessary." To Wolfe: "What were you going to say?"
"That Mr. Oster can describe the situation to the others, including what Mr. Vaughn said to Mr. Goodwin on the telephone. He can also learn if any of them have alibis - from eight o'clock last evening to two o'clock this morning - that can be verified." He turned to Oster. "Not difficult for a member of the bar."
I thought, He meant it, that their skin colors weren't factors. He was being as crusty with him as he would have been with a paleface. Oster thought he had

 something to say, first to Wolfe and then to Henchy, but apparently decided it would be more dignified to go without an exit line. A straight course to the connecting door to the front room would have taken him close to where I stood, and he made a point of circling wide. Also more dignified. When he was out and the door shut, I went back to my desk and notebook.
Wolfe said, "I'm obliged to you, Mr. Henchy. I don't like turmoil in my house."

The executive director nodded. "I don't like it anywhere. Many people wouldn't believe that, a man in my position, but I don't like it. I like restraint. I like peace, and maybe I'll get some before I die. I guess you want two things from me: what I said to Mr. Vaughn and where I was last evening."
"Not necessarily where you were, unless you have an alibi that can be established."
"I haven't, not for the whole time from eight o'clock to two. I know a little about alibis; I've had experience. As for Mr. Vaughn, I don't think I had ever seen him before. I see many people. I won't try to tell you what I said to him yesterday word for word because I'm not good at that. I didn't say much; it was really just one thing. Not about Susan's - Miss Brooke's - who killed her. He only asked about her and Dunbar, whether they were planning to marry. Of course I knew they were, but I didn't tell him that. I said I knew nothing about it, that I never meddled in the personal affairs of members of the staff. That's all there was to it."

"I think it likely, yes."

Well, we didn't."
Wolfe nodded. "You would say that, naturally."
"Not just 'naturally.'" His hands were cupped over the ends of the chair arms, gripping them. "This is the truth if I ever spoke it, if anyone on our staff is a murderer I want him punished to the full extent. It will make it harder for us, it already has, Dunbar in jail, but if we expect to be treated like good citizens we must be good citizens. But you're wrong, I'm positive you're wrong. At noon today Mr. Ewing heard about the murder of Peter Vaughn on the radio and came and told me, and I got them in my room, all of them who spoke with Vaughn yesterday, and I put it to them straight.

Wolfe wasn't impressed, and neither was I. The executive director of the ROCC had made a lot of speeches to a lot of audiences; he had had a lot of practice saying things like "This is the truth if I ever spoke it." Granting that he had spread the odds some on his own ticket, on the others he was merely taking the line that a man in his position had to take, though I admit he had done it better than some I had heard on other occasions.
"Admirable," Wolfe said. "I like to hear words well used. As for my being wrong, only the event can answer. Will you please ask Mr. Faison to come?"
"Certainly." Henchy levered on the chair arms to rise. "I was going to mention, about alibis. Of course I asked them. None of them has an alibi he could prove beyond question. Mr. Oster could have told you that, but he was agitated."

"Not just 'naturally.'" His hands were cupped over the ends of the chair arms, gripping them. "This is the truth if I ever spoke it, if anyone on our staff is a murderer I want him punished to the full extent. It will make it harder for us, it already has, Dunbar in jail, but if we expect to be treated like good citizens we must be good citizens. But you're wrong, I'm positive you're wrong. At noon today Mr. Ewing heard about the murder of Peter Vaughn on the radio and came and told me, and I got them in my room, all of them who spoke with Vaughn yesterday, and I put it to them straight. I told them the police might never learn that Vaughn had been there, but if they did, there was to be no covering up. I told them that if one of them was involved in any way, I wanted to know it then and there. I told them that if any one of them had the slightest suspicion about another one, he was to speak up, then and there."
He released the chair arms and turned his hands over. "I know my people, Mr. Wolfe. Not only because they're my color; I know them. In my position I have to. They were there in my room with me for nearly two hours, and we talked it out. When we got through I was absolutely certain that none of them was involved in the murder of Peter Vaughn or Susan Brooke, and I was certain that none of them had any suspicion of any of the others. I'm not saying I'm as good at it as you are, but I know them! Believe me, you're wrong. See them and question them, all right, but you're wrong!"
Wolfe wasn't impressed, and neither was I. The executive director of the ROCC had made a lot of speeches to a lot of audiences; he had had a lot of practice saying things like "This is the truth if I ever spoke it." Granting that he had spread the odds some on his own ticket, on the others he was merely taking the line that a man in his position had to take, though I admit he had done it better than some I had heard on other occasions.
==> "Admirable," Wolfe said. "I like to hear words well used. As for my being wrong, only the event can answer. Will you please ask Mr. Faison to come?" <==
"Certainly." Henchy levered on the chair arms to rise. "I was going to mention, about alibis. Of course I asked them. None of them has an alibi he could prove beyond question. Mr. Oster could have told you that, but he was agitated."
Wolfe nodded. "I like your taste in words. 'Agitated.' He was indeed."


I was at the door to the front room, and when I swung it open as Henchy came, the sound of Oster's voice, in charge, was heard. It didn't stop, so apparently Henchy summoned Faison by hand; anyhow, the fund raiser appeared and crossed to the chair his boss had vacated as I shut the door.

Wolfe scowled at him, and no wonder. What was there left to ask? Cass Faison's grin wasn't working, and from his expression it seemed doubtful if it would ever work again, but his coal-black skin still had its high gloss when the light hit it right.
Wolfe spoke. "No preamble is required, Mr. Faison, since Mr. Oster has described the situation. Mr. Henchy sent Mr. Vaughn to you?"

"Had you ever seen him before?"
"No. None of us had ever seen him before."
"How long was he with you?"
"Not more than three or four minutes. I wasn't timing it. Possibly five." "What was said?"
"He said the same thing to all of us. He wanted to know how intimate Miss Brooke had been with Mr. Whipple. We all said the same thing to him. We said we didn't know. He didn't want to believe that. He said someone there must know. He was all - he was in a fret. I sent him to Mr. Ewing."
==> Wolfe's lips were tight. He turned to me. "This is farcical." <==

Yes, sir. They talked it out for two hours with Mr. Henchy." "Bring them."
It occurred to me as I crossed to the door that I might as well get a little personal satisfaction. I would put Miss Tiger in the red leather chair. But Wolfe might himself interfere with that, so when I opened the door I asked Henchy to come and took him to the red leather chair, and then summoned the others. Since Saul had moved up enough chairs for all, I was free to enjoy the look on Oster's face when he saw I had foxed him. That settled my relations with Harold R. Oster. We were enemies for life, and that suited me fine.
Wolfe took them in, from Henchy at the far left to Maud Jordan at the far right, nearest me. "I'm through," he said. "I'm through with you for today, but not with the job I'm doing. The situation is unaltered. I have learned nothing whatever from Mr. Henchy, Mr. Oster, or Mr. Faison, except that you are presenting a solid front. You are maintaining that your exchanges with Mr. Vaughn yesterday were identical. I don't believe it. I believe - "

ere you born?"
==> She was only the switchboard, but nobody shushed her, not even a murmur or two. She was a volunteer, and she had given half a grand to the fund for Medgar Evers's children. Wolfe's head turned left. "Do you wish to support that indictment, Mr. Henchy?" <==
"No. I think you're wrong, but no, I wouldn't call it bullying."
"Do you wish to add anything, Miss Jordan?"
"No. I mean what I said."
"Mr. Ewing, I haven't spoken with you. Have you anything to say?"
"No, only that I agree with Mr. Henchy. If you think one of us is a murderer, you're wrong, but I wouldn't call it bullying. I know what it will be like if the police find out he came there yesterday morning. Are you going to tell them?"

"Miss Tiger. Do you wish to say anything?" "No," she said, barely audible.
"Then we're through. For today. I may see all of you again, and I certainly expect to see one of you; I would give something to know which one. To answer Mr. Ewing's question, I shall not tell the police of Mr. Vaughn's ill fated visit. I bid you good afternoon merely as a civility."
He leaned back, laced his fingers at his center mound, and closed his eyes.
==> I was surprised at Oster. Not a word. He got up and headed for the hall. Saul Panzer, who was on a chair over by the bookshelves, followed him out, and as the others rose and moved, no one saying anything, I stayed put. Saul was there. I don't especially mind holding a coat for a murderer, but I like to know when I'm doing it. I looked at my watch: 5:19. Wolfe could still have forty minutes with the orchids, but apparently he preferred to take a nap. I sat and watched his big chest rise and fall, expecting, and I admit hoping, to see the lip exercise start, but it didn't. When the sounds from the hall ended with the closing of the front door and Saul came and took the yellow chair nearest me, he was still just sitting and breathing. <==

"In a way," I told Saul, "I'm glad you've seen her. I'll be doing a lot of talking about her in the future and you'll appreciate it better. I'm sure you'll agree that the best way to handle it is to cherish and covet her at a distance, but the question is what distance. A mile is a distance, but so is a yard or even an inch. I wish I knew more about poetry. If I could turn out -"
"Shut up!" Wolfe bellowed.
I turned and said, "Yes, sir. I was only remarking about the one single aspect of the party that struck me as worthy of remark. Was there any other?"
"No." He had straightened up.

"Then there's no argument. I might as well go on remarking about Miss Tiger. Two days ago I said there wasn't one sensible thing anybody could do. Now it's even worse; there's not even one unsensible thing."
"Confound it, don't sit there inventing grotesque words!"
"Shall I go?" Saul asked.

"I'm sorry." "Archie?" "Sorry and sad."
He glared. "Two highly trained and highly skilled men, and what good are you? Go somewhere. Do something. Am I to sit here another evening, and go up to bed, contemplating frustration? Reflecting, in desperation, as I did day before yesterday on a diphthong?"
Saul and I exchanged glances. Our genius was going potty on us. To humor him I inquired, "A diphthong?"

Yes. Tenuous almost to nullity, it was unworthy of consideration. It still is. But I'm bereft, and it's a fact. Get Mr. Vaughn."
==> For half a second I thought he was worse than potty; then, realizing that there was a Mr. Vaughn who was still alive, and that diphthonp might be his hobby, I got at the phone. With his son not yet buried, Samuel Vaughn probably wouldn't be at Heron Manhattan, Inc., but I tried it on the chance, was told that he wasn't in today, and dialed his home number. He wasn't accessible until I made it clear that Nero Wolfe wanted to ask him a question - I didn't say about a diphthong - and in a couple of minutes I had him, and Wolfe took his phone. <==
"I presume to disturb you, Mr. Vaughn, only because I am concerned with the death of your son in connection with my investigation of the death of Susan Brooke, and I need a bit of information you may be able to supply. According to the published accounts, your son graduated from Harvard in nineteen fifty-nine. Is that correct?"
"Yes. Why do you ask?"
"To lead to the next question. I'd rather not elucidate now, but it's possible that this will be helpful in identifying a murderer. Do you know if your son was acquainted with a fellow student named Richard Ault? A-U-L-T. Perhaps a classmate?"
"I'm afraid I don't - Walt a minute... yes, I do. That was the name of the boy that committed suicide that summer, after they graduated. My son told me about it. Yes, he knew him rather well; they took the same courses. But I don't understand... what possible connection "
'There may be none. I f I find one, you'll understand then. Do you know if your son ever visited Richard Ault at his home - perhaps at vacation time?"

"Where was his home?"
"Evansville, Indiana."
'Then he didn't. I'm sure he didn't. Have you any reason to think he did?"
"No. I'm obliged to you. Mr. Vaughn, for indulging me. If this leads to anything, the obligation will be canceled."

==> As I cradled the receiver my eyes were narrowed at it. I was considering diphthongs. Ch? Gh? Au? Wh? Br? I'd have to look it up. Too many years had passed since the fourth grade, or maybe fifth. I was interrupted by Wolfe saying, "Get Mr. Drucker." <==
Again it took me half a second to catch up; it had been ten days since I had eaten roast beef and apple pie with Otto Drucker, the distinguished citizen, in my hotel room in Racine. I got his number from the file and put in the call, and when I got him I took time for a few sociable remarks before passing him to Wolfe. He told Wolfe it was a pleasure to speak with a man whose career he had followed with interest and admiration.
Wolfe grunted. "I may forfeit the admiration by the job I'm on now. You may be able to supply some needed information. I suppose you remember your conversation with Mr. Goodwin?"
"Certainly. Susan Brooke. Are you still on that?"
"I am. I'm floundering. What can you tell me of the young man who shot himself on the porch of the Brooke house?"
"Not much. I told Goodwin all I know. I didn't even remember his name."

"He didn't say 'command,' but he said you'd reciprocate and I appreciate it. I like that 'command.' If you need more on this let me know."
==> Wolfe said he would, hung up, pushed the phone away as if he resented it, which he does, pushed his chair back, left it, walked over to the globe, twirled it, and focused on a spot near the center of the United States of America. In a minute he demanded, not turning, "Where the devil is Evansville?" <==

If you've got Indiana, at the bottom, on the Ohio River." Another ten seconds, and he turned. "How do you get there?" "Probably the quickest would be a plane to Louisville."
"I'd have to be back Monday morning for a little job," Saul said. "No, Archie will go. You're needed here. Archie, find - "
He stopped because I had turned to the phone and started dialing.

At ten minutes past two Friday morning I sat on a wooden chair at the end of a glasstopped desk in a room with two windows, being sized up by a cop. I wasn't exactly in the pink, after the day in New York, the plane ride to Louisville, and the three-hour drive in a rented car to Evansville, but since I now knew which diphthong it was, and I would sleep better after I got the answers to a few questions, and police headquarters is open all night, I had stopped at the hotel only long enough to sign in. I admit that as I sat I had to tell myself to keep my shoulders up.
The cop's name was Sievers, Lieutenant Sievers, an old pro with very little hair but plenty of jaw. He gave my New York State detective license a thorough look, handed it back, and frowned at me. "Archie Goodwin," he said. "Haven't I seen that name somewhere?"
==> "I hope not on a hot dodger. You may have seen the name of the man I work for, Nero Wolfe." <==
"Oh." He nodded. "That one. Yeah. How do you stand him?"
"I've asked myself that question a thousand times, and damned if I can answer it."
"Don't expect me to. What's your problem here?"
"Just a little information we need, about a man named Richard Ault, or I should

"My neck's out far enough." "When are you leaving?"
"There's a plane from Louisville at five p.m. I have a car I rented there. I'd like to ask that lawyer, Littauer, a couple of questions." I stood. "How long have you been on the force?"
"Twenty-six years."
"Then what the hell, you don't have to spell your name. I would deeply appreciate it if you'd leave the monkey wrench in the drawer. Say we leave at one-thirty?"
He wasn't sure, he would ring me around noon, but from the look in his eye and the grip in his hand as we shook I was satisfied that I would have a companion for the trip home.
==> It was exactly three o'clock when, after leaving a call for seven-forty-five, I got between sheets in the hotel room, and I certainly needed a nap, but there was something on my mind. Not whether it was in the bag, that was okay, but how we got it. Had it been luck or genius or what?

ppened to notice that there was an au in four of the names: Paul, Ault, Maud, and Vaughn, but I might have; anybody might. That was nothing special. The point was, if I had noticed it, then what? I would have filed it as just coincidence, and probably Wolfe had too. But although filed, that au in four of the names was still somewhere in his mind later, when it got really tough, so in going over and over it, every detail and every factor, that popped up. Okay, but then what? Did he deliberately team them up?
Paul and Ault Paul and Maud Paul and Vaughn Ault and Maud Ault and Vaughn Maud and Vaughn
Then did he consider each pair and finally decide that the one that might not be just coincidence was Ault and Maud, because if a woman named Ault changed her name she might pick one that had au in it? No. I could have done that myself. I hadn't, but I could. What had happened in his mind that had made him phone Samuel Vaughn and Otto Drucker, and send me to Evansville, was something that had never happened in mine and never would. He had said "tenuous almost to nullity." But there I was in Evansville, and I knew who had killed Susan Brooke and Peter Vaughn, and probably I never would have known if Wolfe hadn't started reflecting on a diphthong.
Reflecting that I had been wasting some precious time, I turned over to go to sleep, but jor butted in. She had not only used the Ault au in Maud, she had also used the Marjorie jor in Jordan. If Wolfe had known Mrs. Ault's name was Marjorie he would have sewed it up a week ago. On that I slept.

Perhaps the trouble with my experiences with lawyers is that I am never a prospective client, ready with a checkbook for a retainer. All I ever have is questions, usually questions they would prefer not to answer, and so it was with H. Ernest Littauer, in a big sunny room with a fine view of the Ohio River. I merely wanted to know if he had been in communication with Mrs. Marjorie Ault during the past year or so, and he merely didn't want to tell me. And he didn't, but I gathered that he had no idea where she was and didn't care.
When I got to the parking lot at a quarter to one, Sievers was already there, with a suitcase big enough to last at least a week, and I suspected I had been a little too hospitable.
It wasn't going to be billed to a client. But he was going to help clean up the mess, so he was welcome. He was good enough company, though not in the class of Otto Drucker. By the time we touched concrete at Idlewild - I mean Kennedy International Airport - it was obvious that he was only a good working cop, which was why after twenty-six years he was still a lieutenant. He said he

 preferred to handle his evening himself if he wasn't needed, so I taxied him to the Churchill and proceeded to 35th Street.
==> It was only eight-forty, but Wolfe was in the office with coffee, and that deserved a grin. Business was not to be mentioned at meals, so he had either started dinner early or speeded it up in order to be away from the table when I arrived. There was a hint of feeling in his look and voice as he greeted me, as there always is when I return safe and sound from a trip in longdistance machines. I stood in the middle of the rug and took a good stretch, and said, "My God, it's cold around here, much colder than down on the Ohio River. The warmth in this room is wonderful, even if I had no personal connection with its production. I admit that the rapid advance of automation may result - " <==
"Sit down and report!"
I did so, verbatim. He didn't lean back and shut his eyes; there was no need to, since it was only the happy ending. When I finished by saying that we might be stuck for a week in town by Lieutenant Sievers he didn't bat an eye.
He picked up his coffee cup and emptied it and put it down. "Archie," he said, "I tender my apologies. I noticed that confounded diphthong Monday evening, and I could have sent you to Evansville then. Three wretched days."
"Yeah. Well, you finally got around to it. I accept the apology. It's too bad it's Friday night, the weekend, and some of them may not be available tomorrow, maybe none of them. I suggest that they deserve to be present, all the ROCC crowd, even Oster. Also Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Brooke. And why not Susan's mother? In a way, her more than anyone else. She was there in the house with Susan when Richard Ault shot himself on the porch. According to Drucker, she helped Susan give him the boot. She ought to - "
I stopped short. Wolfe asked, "What?"

 look in the book. I got it, and dialed, and sat and listened to fourteen buzzes, two more than my usual allowance. I don't dial wrong numbers, so I didn't try again but dialed another number, one that was on the card, and that time got an answer, a voice that I recognized, saying, "Mrs. Brooke's residence."
'This is Archie Goodwin," I said, "at Nero Wolfe's office. Mr. Wolfe wants to ask Mrs. Matthew Brooke a question, and I just dialed her number and got no answer. I thought she might be with you. Is she?"

She hadn't opened her mouth. She did now, and spoke to the point. "I haven't got a permit for that gun," she said. "That's against the law, having a gun without a permit, but it doesn't justify this kind of treatment." Her eyes darted to Saul and back to Wolfe. "I was getting into a car at the invitation of the woman driving it, and that man assaulted me."
Wolfe ignored her and asked Saul, "Should you report?"

He shook his head. "I don't think it's necessary, unless you want the details, where and when. We closed in when she opened the car door and was getting in, and I put her in the back seat with me, and Orrie got in front with Mrs. Brooke. That's all there was to it. There was no commotion. Mrs. Brooke made a little noise, but we calmed her down. Orrie's good at that. It was in Central Park. Do you want details?"
"Not now. Probably never." Wolfe turned. "This need not be prolonged, Mrs. Ault. Since it can easily be - "

Wolfe ignored her and asked Saul, "Should you report?"

He shook his head. "I don't think it's necessary, unless you want the details, where and when. We closed in when she opened the car door and was getting in, and I put her in the back seat with me, and Orrie got in front with Mrs. Brooke. That's all there was to it. There was no commotion. Mrs. Brooke made a little noise, but we calmed her down. Orrie's good at that. It was in Central Park. Do you want details?"
"Not now. Probably never." Wolfe turned. "This need not be prolonged, Mrs. Ault. Since it can easily be - "
"My name is Maud Jordan."

The doorbell rang.
I went to the hall for a look, swallowed something that had been wanting to be swallowed for ten minutes, turned my head, and said, "Mr. Panzer and Miss Jordan. Have they an appointment?"
15
As I approached I saw through the one-way glass that Saul had a hold on her right arm, so as I opened the door I was prepared to take her left one if necessary, but she crossed the sill without any help. Saul said, "Orrie's in the car with Mrs. Brooke. Do you want her?" I said no, Orrie had better see her home, and he went to tell him. I mentioned somewhere that I don't mind helping a murderer with a coat, but Maud Jordan shook her head when I offered. She was keeping it on. Thinking that Saul should have the honor of escorting her to the office, I waited until he came back in and then followed them. Saul moved up one of the yellow chairs for her and started for one for himself, but Wolfe told him to take the red leather. Before he did so he took an object from his pocket and put it on Wolfe's desk, and Wolfe made a face at it and told me to take it. It was a snub-nosed Haskell .32, and I took a look to see if it was loaded. It was, and I dropped it in a drawer. Saul said, "It was in her coat pocket," and sat.
She hadn't opened her mouth. She did now, and spoke to the point. "I haven't got a permit for that gun," she said. "That's against the law, having a gun without a permit, but it doesn't justify this kind of treatment." Her eyes darted to Saul and back to Wolfe. "I was getting into a car at the invitation of the woman driving it, and that man assaulted me."

"My name has always been Maud Jordan."
'That won't do. There's a man at the Churchill Hotel, my guest, who arrived about an hour ago. Lieutenant Sievers, George Sievers, of the Evansville police. If he isn't immediately available he will be shortly. Shall we postpone the conversation until Mr. Goodwin brings him?"
I have seen a lot of faces do a lot of things, but what hers did in twenty seconds, maybe a little more, was amazing. When she heard the name, Sievers, her eyes shut, tight, and I swear I could see the color go from her skin, though I wouldn't have said, before, that it had any color. I don't often get fancy, but it was exactly as if what I saw going was not color, but life. It wasn't like just turning pale; it was quite different. I didn't enjoy it. I looked at Saul and saw that he was seeing it too, and he wasn't enjoying it either.

==> In another half a minute her eyes opened, at Wolfe, but I had her in profile and couldn't see if they had changed too. "George Sievers was in my class at school," she said. <==
Apparently she thought that called for comment. Wolfe grunted.
"Anyway," she said, "I can talk. You don't know how hard it's been. The niggers. Sometimes I thought I would choke, with Mr. Henchy and Mr. Ewing and Mister Mister Mister. But I did it, I killed her. She had a right to die, and I killed her."

"My name is Marjorie Ault!"
"As you will. I advise you not to speak until you are more composed."
"I haven't been as composed for years as I am now. Since the day my Richard died. I'm glad you found out about me because now I can talk. I thought you would. Do you know when I thought you would?"
"No."
'The day I was here with the niggers, the first time, when you asked so much about the phone call, about it being Susan's voice. I thought you knew then that she hadn't made the call, that nobody had, that there hadn't been any phone call. Didn't you?"
==> "No. If I had ..." Wolfe let it go. No use trying to explain when she wanted only to talk, not listen. <==
She talked. "I knew someday I would be telling about it, but I didn't know it would be you. I want you to know, I want everybody to know, that I didn't decide to kill her just on account of my Richard. All I decided was that I wanted to see her, to know about her. That's why I sold the business and - You know I had a good business?"
"Yes."
'That's why I sold it and got it all in cash and came to New York and changed my name. But after I got here I saw it wouldn't be so easy because I didn't want to be friends with her. Then when she started working for that ROCC, that was my chance. I had plenty of money, and I made a big contribution and offered to work for them. That was hard, I want you to understand that, and I want you to understand that up till then I didn't intend to kill her. I didn't have any idea of killing her. I didn't even want to hurt her; I just wanted to know her. Do you understand that?"
"Yes."
"Do you understand how hard it was, there with them?"

"You took the gun along."
She passed her tongue over her lips. "I'm not going to talk about that." "And you had it again this evening, for Mrs. Brooke. The same gun?"
"Of course. It was my husband's. He always carried it when he brought money from the bank for the payroll. I don't want to talk about that, I want to talk about Susan. She called me Maud, you know, and I called her Susan. Of course my Richard had called her Susan, he told me all about her, but I had never met her. I have two pictures of her that he had, one with him. I'm not sure you understand how I felt about her. I'm not saying I loved her because my Richard had, that wasn't it exactly, but I wanted to be close to her, I wanted to see her every day.

 Do you understand that?"
==> "I think I do. It's somewhat involved." Wolfe's eyes moved. "The kitchen extension, Archie." <==
I pressed a button and got up and went. As I passed Saul he winked. I'm going to talk him out of that some day. In the kitchen I sat at my breakfast table, pulled the phone over, and dialed. Cramer doesn't like to be called at his home number, but if I had rung Homicide South I would probably have got Rowcliff, and I didn't want to take the time and trouble to get him stuttering. After four buzzes a female voice I knew said hello, and I said, 'This is Archie Goodwin, Mrs. Cramer. May I speak to the inspector, please?"
She said she'd see, and in a minute there was a growl in my ear, "What do you want, Goodwin?"
"I'm in the kitchen. Mr. Wolfe needs help. The woman who killed Susan Brooke and Peter Vaughn is in the office with him, talking a blue streak, and won't stop. She has explained why she killed Susan, and now she's explaining - "
"Damn you, are you clowning?"
"I am not. I'm sick and tired of being accused of clowning by cops. This morning in Evansville, Indiana, a police lieutenant did, and I brought him - "

The connection went. I went to a shelf for a glass and to the refrigerator for milk. It would probably be six or seven minutes before company came, and I had had enough of that face, even in profile.

==> Yesterday afternoon Paul Whipple came, no appointment, a little after six o'clock. He was quite natty in a brown macron or zacron or something, tropical weight, about the same shade as his skin, but I thought he was rushing it a little. It was toward the end of May, but it was cool and breezy, and on my morning walk I had buttoned my jacket and wanted more. I took him to the office and to the red leather chair, and Wolfe, who had just picked up his current book, put it down almost politely. They conversed a little on matters of interest, such as the trial of Marjorie Ault, which had just ended with a conviction and a life sentence, and then Whipple mentioned what he had come to mention. <==
"I was wondering," he said, "about a check I sent you six weeks ago. It hasn't come through my bank, and I was wondering if you got it."
Wolfe nodded. "I tore it up."
"But you shouldn't. I'm going to insist. It wasn't much, for what you did, but I said we would pay what we could, and we want to. My wife and my son - we insist."
"I resent that, Mr. Whipple." "You resent it?"
"Certainly. I undertook to cancel an obligation, and I have done so, and you would restore it. Pfui. I wouldn't have made the original fantastic engagement, to find a blemish on that woman, for any fee any man could offer. Its development wasn't your doing and didn't affect the nature of my commitment. What you insist on is keeping me in your debt."

"My wife likes her and she's very happy about it. I'm going to tell you something my wife said the other day. We were discussing the trial, Mrs. Ault, and we got to talking about you, and she said, "I wish he was a Negro.'" He smiled. "Now there's a compliment."
Wolfe grunted. "If I were, Mr. Goodwin would have to be one too."
I haven't bothered to take that apart. As I said, I gave up long ago trying to figure how his mind works.

He said pfui and hung up, and I admit I had asked for it.

There would be the problem of spotting a tail and shaking it, and that can take time, so I would have to get help if I wanted to be punctual for the appointment. Also I should be prepared for the remote possibility that Ernst Muller was sensitive about having his arm twisted and was intending to return the compliment, so I got the shoulder holster from the drawer and put it on, and the Marley.38, and loaded it. But another kind of ammunition might be needed, and I opened the safe and got a grand in used tens and twenties from the cash reserve. Of course there were other conceivables, such as that I was going to have my picture taken in a room with a naked female or a corpse or God knew what, but I would have to dive off of that bridge when I came to it.
It was one minute to eleven when I left the house. With no glance around, I walked to the drugstore at the corner of Ninth Avenue, entered, went to the phone booth, and dialed the number of the garage on Tenth Avenue which houses the Heron sedan that Wolfe owns and I drive. Tom Halloran, who had been there for ten years, didn't answer, but after a wait I got him and explained the program, and he said he would be ready in five minutes. Thinking it would be better to give him ten, I looked over the rack of paperbacks awhile before leaving. Heading back on Thirty-fifth Street, I went on past the brownstone, turned right at Tenth Avenue, entered the garage office, went on through, and crossed to a Ford sedan standing there with the engine running. Tom was in front behind the wheel. I climbed in the back, took my hat off and curled up on the floor, clear down, and the car moved.

There may be leg room in that Ford model, but there's not body room for a six- footer who is not an expert contortionist, and I suffered. After five minutes of it I began to suspect that Tom was jerking to stops and around corners just to see how tough I was, but I was stuck, in more ways than one. My ribs were about to give and my legs were going numb when he stopped for the sixth time and his voice came. "All right, pal. All clear."
"Damn it, get a crowbar."
He laughed. I worked my head and shoulders up, got a grip on the rim of the seat back, somehow made it, and put my hat on. We were at Twenty-third Street and Ninth Avenue. "How sure are you?" I asked him.
"Posilutely. Not a chance."

"Right on time," he growled. "Come in." He sidestepped, and I crossed the sill.
My eyes have been trained so long to notice things that they took in the room automatically - the double bed, dresser with a mirror, two chairs, table with a desk pad that needed changing, open door to a bathroom - while my mind adjusted to the shock. Then, as I put my coat and hat on the bed, I got another shock: one of the chairs, the one without arms, was near the table, and on the table was a carton of milk and a glass. By God, he had bought it and brought it for his guest. I don't blame you if you don't believe it. I didn't, but there it was.
He went to the other chair, the one with arms, sat, and asked, "Are you loose?"
"Sure. I always obey instructions."
"Sit down."

My eyes were meeting his. "Look," I said, "you know damn well how it is. If I

 had listed a hundred names of people who might be here, yours wouldn't have been on it. Is this carton of milk for me?"
"Yes."
"Then you're off your hinges. You are not the Inspector Cramer I know so well, and I don't know what I'm up against. Why do you want to know if our phone is tapped?"

"Yes."
"Then you're off your hinges. You are not the Inspector Cramer I know so well, and I don't know what I'm up against. Why do you want to know if our phone is tapped?"
"Because I don't like to make things more complicated than they are already. I like things simple. I'd like to know if I could just have called you and asked you to come here."
"Oh. Sure you could, but if you had I would have suggested that it might be better if we went for a ride."
==> He nodded. "All right. I want to know, Goodwin. I know Wolfe has tangled with the FBI, and I want the picture. All of it. If it takes all day." <==
I shook my head. "That's out of bounds and you know it."
He exploded. "Goddammit, "this" is out of bounds! My being here! My getting you here! I thought you had some sense! Don't you realize what I'm doing?"
"No. I haven't the slightest idea what you're doing."
"Then I'll tell you. I know you pretty well, Goodwin. I know you and Wolfe cut corners, I ought to, but I also know what your limits are. So here, just you and me, I'll tell you. About two hours ago the Commissioner called me. He had had a call from Jim Perazzo - do you know who Jim Perazzo is?"
"Yeah, I happen to. Licensing Services, State Department, State of New York. Two-seventy Broadway."

I picked up the carton of milk, pried the flap open, and poured, carefully. One thing was obvious. He could have either phoned me to come to his office, or have come to Wolfe's house, but he hadn't because he suspected that our line was tapped and the house was watched. Therefore he didn't want the FBI to know that he was making contact, and he had gone to a lot of trouble to make it. He was telling me about the FBI and Perazzo and the Commissioner, which was ridiculous for a police inspector talking to a private detective. Therefore he didn't want us to lose our licenses, and therefore something was biting him, and it was desirable to find out what it was. In such a situation, before spilling it, especially to a cop, I should ring Wolfe and put it up to him, but that was out. My standing instructions were that in any emergency I was to use my intelligence guided by experience.
I did so. I sipped some milk, put the glass down, and said, "If you can break a rule so can I. It's like this."

He left the chair and moved. He tiptoed to the door, smooth and silent considering his age and bulk, jerked the door open, and stuck his head out. Evidently he wasn't as sure he was loose as I was that I was. He shut the door and went to the bathroom, and I heard water spurting from a faucet, and in a minute he came with a glass of water. He drank it, in no hurry, put the glass on the table, sat, and narrowed his eyes at me.
"I've been a cop for thirty-six years," he said, "and this is the first time I've ever passed the buck to an outsider."

"That'll have to do. You won't have to take notes, with your tape-recorder memory. Does the name Morris Althaus mean anything to you?" He spelled it.
I nodded. "I read the papers. One that you haven't cracked. Shot. In the chest. Late November. No gun."
"Friday night, November twentieth. The body was found the next morning by a cleaning woman. Died between eight p.m. Friday and three a.m. Saturday. One shot, in at his chest and through the middle of his pump and on out at the back, denting a rib. The bullet went on and hit the wall forty-nine inches above the floor, but it was spent and only nicked it. He was on his back, legs stretched out, left arm straight at his side and right arm crossing his chest. Dressed but no jacket, in his shirtsleeves. No disorder, no sign of a struggle. As you said, no gun. Am I going too fast?"

He shook his head. "I'll give you everything but that. He couldn't help you anyway. He saw them leave the house and go to the car and drive off, and he got the license number. That's how we know and all we know. We're hogtied. Even if we could name them, where would that get us? I've seen plenty of murderers I could name, but so what, if I couldn't prove it. But this one, that goddam outfit, I'd give a year's pay to hook them and make it stick. This isn't their town, it's mine. Ours. The New York Police Department. They've had us gritting our teeth for years. Now, by God, they think they can break and enter people's houses and commit homicide in "my" territory, and laugh at me!"
"Did they? Laugh?"
"Yes. I went to Sixty-ninth Street myself and saw Wragg. I told him that of course they had known that Althaus was collecting material for a piece, and maybe they had had a stake-out on him the night he was killed, and if so I would appreciate some cooperation. He said he would like to help if he could, but they had too many important things to do to bother about a hack muckraker. I didn't

 tell him they had been seen. He "would" have laughed."
==> His jaw was working. "Of course it has been discussed in the Commissioner's office. Several times. I'm hogtied. We wouldn't like anything better than hanging it on that bunch of grabbers, but what have we got for a jury, and what could we get? So we lay off. So I say this: I'll not only write a report on Wolfe and you for the Commissioner, I'll see him and talk to him. I don't think you'll lose your licenses. But I won't tell him about seeing you." <==
He rose and went to the bed and came back with his hat and coat. "You might as well finish the milk. And I hope that Mrs. Bruner gets her money's worth." He put out a hand. "Happy New Year."
"The same to you." I got up and shook. "Could he identify them if it came to that?"
"For God's sake, Goodwin. Three against one?"
"I know. But if it were needed just for a frill, could he?"
"Possibly. He thinks he could. I've given you all I've got. Don't come and don't phone. Give me a few minutes to get out." He started for the door, turned and said, "Give Wolfe my regards," and went.

It was twenty minutes past noon when I stepped out of the lobby of the Westside Hotel. I felt like walking. For one thing, I was still loose, and it was nice to walk without wondering if I had company. For another thing, I didn't want to think hard on top, and when I walk the hard thinking, if any, is down where it doesn't use words. And for a third thing, I wanted to do some sightseeing. It was a nice sunny winter day, not much wind, and I crossed town to Sixth Avenue and turned south.
To show the kind of thinking that comes on top with no effort when I'm walking, as I crossed Washington Square I was thinking that it was a coincidence that Arbor Street was in the Village and Sarah Dacos lived in the Village. That

To show the kind of thinking that comes on top with no effort when I'm walking, as I crossed Washington Square I was thinking that it was a coincidence that Arbor Street was in the Village and Sarah Dacos lived in the Village. That

 couldn't be called a hard thought, since a quarter of a million people lived in the Village, more or less, and I have known fancier coincidences, but it's a fair sample of what my mind does when I'm walking.
==> I had been in Arbor Street before, no matter why for this report. It's narrow and only three blocks long, with an assortment of old brick houses on either side. Number 63, which was near the middle, had nothing distinctive about it. I stood across the street and looked it over. The windows on the third floor, where Morris Althaus had lived and died, had tan drapes that were drawn. I went to the corner around which the G-men had parked their car. As I said, sightseeing, loose. Actually, of course, I was professionally observing the scene of a crime which might be going to have my attention. It helps somehow. Helps me, not Wolfe; he wouldn't go to the window to see the scene of a crime. I would have liked to go up to the third floor for a look at the living room, but I wanted to get home in time for lunch, so I backtracked to Christopher Street and flagged a taxi. <==
The reason I wanted to be there for lunch was the rule that business must never be mentioned during meals. It was twenty past one when Fritz let me in and I put my coat and hat on the rack, so Wolfe was at the table. Going to the dining room and taking my place across from him, I made a remark about the weather. He grunted and swallowed a bite of braised sweetbread. Fritz came with the dish, and I took some. I was not being merely petty; I was showing him that sometimes rules can be damn silly; one you make so you can enjoy your food can just about spoil a meal. It didn't spoil mine, but there wasn't much conversation.
But there was another reason for saving it. As we pushed our chairs back I told him I wanted to show him something in the basement, and I led the way to the hall, then to the right, and down the steps. The basement has Fritz's room and bath, a storeroom, and a large room with a pool table. In the last is not only the usual raised bench, but also a big comfortable chair on a platform, for Wolfe when he feels like watching Saul Panzer and me use our cues, which happens about once a year. I led him to that room, flipped the wall switch for light, and spoke.
"Your new office. I hope you like it. There may be only one chance in a million that they can bug a room without getting inside, but that's one too many. Be seated." I lifted my rump onto the rim of the pool table, facing the big chair.
He glared. "Are you badgering me or is it possible?"

It was twenty minutes past noon when I stepped out of the lobby of the Westside Hotel. I felt like walking. For one thing, I was still loose, and it was nice to walk without wondering if I had company. For another thing, I didn't want to think hard on top, and when I walk the hard thinking, if any, is down where it doesn't use words. And for a third thing, I wanted to do some sightseeing. It was a nice sunny winter day, not much wind, and I crossed town to Sixth Avenue and turned south.
To show the kind of thinking that comes on top with no effort when I'm walking, as I crossed Washington Square I was thinking that it was a coincidence that Arbor Street was in the Village and Sarah Dacos lived in the Village. That

 couldn't be called a hard thought, since a quarter of a million people lived in the Village, more or less, and I have known fancier coincidences, but it's a fair sample of what my mind does when I'm walking.
I had been in Arbor Street before, no matter why for this report. It's narrow and only three blocks long, with an assortment of old brick houses on either side. Number 63, which was near the middle, had nothing distinctive about it. I stood across the street and looked it over. The windows on the third floor, where Morris Althaus had lived and died, had tan drapes that were drawn. I went to the corner around which the G-men had parked their car. As I said, sightseeing, loose. Actually, of course, I was professionally observing the scene of a crime which might be going to have my attention. It helps somehow. Helps me, not Wolfe; he wouldn't go to the window to see the scene of a crime.

"It's conceivable. I wouldn't risk leaking it that Inspector Cramer told me to give you his regards. Also that he bought me a carton of milk, shook my hand, and wished me a happy New Year."

VINCENT YARMACK, around 50, was another senior editor at "Tick-Tock". I include him because the piece by Althaus about the FBI had been his project.
It didn't look very promising for an approach. I considered the stage personality, but her whirl with Althaus had ended more than a year ago, and besides, a couple of previous experiences had taught me that actresses are better from the fifth or sixth row. The two editors would hang up. Father probably had nothing. Marian Hinckley would stiff-neck me. The best bet was mother, and it was her number I looked up and went to the booth to dial.
First, of course, to get her to the phone. To the female who answered I gave no name; I merely told her, in an official tone, to tell Mrs. Althaus that I was talking from a booth and an FBI man was with me and I must speak to her. It worked. In a couple of minutes another voice came.
"Who is this? An FBI man?" "Mrs. Althaus?"
"Yes."
==> "My name is Archie Goodwin. I'm not an FBI man. I work for Nero Wolfe, the private investigator. The FBI man is not here in the booth with me; he is with me because he is following me. Tailing me. He will follow me to your address, but that doesn't matter to me if it doesn't to you. I must see you - now, if possible. It will - " <==
"I am not seeing anybody."

know. You may have heard of Nero Wolfe. Have you?" "Yes."
"He has been told by a man he knows well that your son Morris was killed by an agent of the FBI. That's why I am being followed. And that's why I must see you. I can be there in ten minutes. Did you get my name? Archie Goodwin."
Silence. Finally: "You "know" who killed my son?"

"Not his name. I don't "know" anything. I only know what Mr. Wolfe has been told. That's all I can say on the phone. If I may make a suggestion, we think Miss Marian Hinckley should know about this too. Perhaps you could phone her and ask her to come, and I can tell both of you. Could you?"
"I could, yes. Are you a newspaper reporter? Is this a trick?"
"No. If I were this would be pretty dumb, you'd only have me bounced. I'm Archie Goodwin."

"But I don't..." Long pause. "Very well. The hallman will ask you for identification."
I told her of course, and hung up before she could change her mind.
When leaving the house I had decided that I would completely iguore the tail question, but I couldn't help it if my eyes, while scouting the street for an empty taxi, took notice of standing vehicles. However, when I was in and rolling, up Madison Avenue and then Park, I kept facing front. To hell with the rear.

When leaving the house I had decided that I would completely iguore the tail question, but I couldn't help it if my eyes, while scouting the street for an empty taxi, took notice of standing vehicles. However, when I was in and rolling, up Madison Avenue and then Park, I kept facing front. To hell with the rear.
It was a regulation Park Avenue hive in the Eighties - marquee, doorman hopping out when the taxi stopped, rubber runner saving the rug in the lobby - but it was Grade A, because the doorman did not double as hallman. When I showed the hallman, who was expecting me, my private investigator license he gave it a good look, handed it back, and told me 10B, and I went to the elevator. On the tenth floor I was admitted by a uniformed female who took my hat and coat, put them in a closet, and conducted me through an arch into a room even bigger than Lily Rowan's, where twenty couples can dance. I have a test for people with rooms that big - not the rugs or the furniture or the drapes, but the pictures on the walls. If I can tell what they are, okay. If all I can do is guess, look out; these people will bear watching. That room passed the test fine. I was

 looking at a canvas showing three girls sitting on the grass under a tree when footsteps came and I turned. She approached. She didn't offer a hand, but she said in a low, soft voice, "Mr. Goodwin? I'm Ivana Althaus," and moved to a chair.
Even without the picture test I would have passed her - her small slender figure with its honest angles, her hair with its honest gray, her eyes with their honest doubt. As I turned a chair to sit facing her I decided to be as honest as possible. She was saying that Miss Hinckley would come soon, but she would prefer not to wait. She had understood me to say on the phone that her son had been killed by an agent of the FBI. Was that correct?
==> Her eyes were straight at me, and I met them. "Not strictly," I told her. "I said that someone told Mr. Wolfe that. I should explain about Mr. Wolfe. He is - uh - eccentric, and he has certain strong feelings about the New York Police Department. He resents their attitude toward him and his work, and he thinks they interfere too much. He reads the newspapers, and especially news about murders, and a couple of weeks ago he got the idea that the police and the District Attorney were letting go on the murder of your son, and when he learned that your son had been collecting material for an article about the FBI he suspected that the letting go might be deliberate. If so, it might be a chance to give the police a black eye, and nothing would please him better." <==
Her eyes were staying straight at me, hardly a blink. "So," I said, "we had no case on our hands, and he started some inquiries. One thing we learned, a fact that hasn't been published, was that nothing about the FBI, no notes or documents, was found by the police in your son s apartment. Perhaps you knew that."
She nodded. "Yes."
"I supposed you did, so I mentioned it. We have learned some other facts which I have been instructed not to mention. You'll understand that. Mr. Wolfe wants to save them until he has enough to act on. But yesterday afternoon a man told him that he knows that an FBI agent killed your son, and he backed it up with some information. I won't give you his name, or the information, but he's a reliable man and the informalion is solid, though it isn't enough to prove it. So Mr. Wolfe wants all he can get from people who were close to your son - for instance, people to whom he may have told things he had learned about the FBI. Of course you are one of them, and so is Miss Hinckley. And Mr. Yarmack. I

 was told to make it clear to you that Mr. Wolfe is not looking for a client or a fee. He is doing this on his own and doesn't want or expect anyone to pay him."

==> She turned to face the arch. A door had closed, and there were voices, and then a girl appeared. As she approached I got up, but Mrs. Althaus kept her chair. The pictures in the "Gazette" file understated it. Marian Hinckley was a dish. She was an in-between, neither blonde nor brunette, brown hair and blue eyes, and she moved straight and smooth. If she wore a hat she had ditched it in the foyer. She came and gave Mrs. Althaus a cheek kiss, then turned to look at me as Mrs Althaus pronounced my name. As the blue eyes took me in I instructed mine to ignore any aspect of the situation that was irrelevant to the job. When Mrs. Althaus invited her to sit I moved a chair up.

"I'm afraid I didn't get it straight," Mrs. Althaus said. "Will you tell her, Mr. Goodwin?"
I described it, the three points: why Wolfe was interested, what had made him suspicious, and how his suspicion had been supported by what a man told him yesterday. I explained that he didn't "know" it was the FBI, and he certainly couldn't prove it, but he intended to try to and that was why I was there.

"No."
"Miss Hinckley?"
"No. But we've told them everything we know."

"Does Mr. Yarmack know?"
"I don't know. I don't think so."
"How do you feel about it, Miss Hinckley? Whoever killed Morris Althaus, do you want him caught? Caught and dealt with?"

Of course I do. Certainly I do."
==> I turned to Mrs. Althaus. "You do too. All right, it's a good bet that he never "will" be caught unless Nero Wolfe does it. You may know that he doesn't go to see people. You'll have to go to him, to his house - you and Miss Hinckley, and, if possible, Mr. Yarmack. Can you be there this evening at nine o'clock?" <==
"Why..." She had her hands clasped. "I don't... What good would it do? There's nothing I can tell him."
"There might be. I often think there's nothing "I" can tell him, but I find out I'm wrong. Or if he only decides that none of you can tell him anything, that will help. Will you come?"
"I suppose..." She looked at the girl who had been expecting to be her daughter- in-law.
"Yes," Miss Hinckley said. "I'll go."
I could have hugged her. It would have been relevant to the job. I asked her, "Could you bring Mr. Yarmack?"

==> To Mrs. Althaus: "I should tell you, it's next to certain that the FBI has a watch on the house and you will be seen. If you don't mind, Mr. Wolfe doesn't. He's perfectly willing for them to know he is investigating the murder of your son. Nine o'clock?" <==
She said yes, and I went. In the foyer the maid came and wanted to hold my coat, and not to hurt her feelings I let her. Down in the lobby, from the look the doorman gave me as he opened the door I deduced that the hallman had told him what I was, and to be in character I met the look with a sharp and wary eye. Outside, some snowflakes were doing stunts. In the taxi, headed downtown, again I ignored the rear. I figured that if they were on me, which was highly likely, maybe one cent of each ten grand of Wolfe's income tax, and one mill of each ten grand of mine, would go to pay government employees to keep me company uninvited, which didn't seem right.

 had just come down from the plant rooms after his four-to-six afternoon session with the orchids and got nicely settled in his chair with "The Treasure of Our Tongue". Instead of going on in and crossing to my desk as usual, I stopped at the sill of the office door, and when he looked up I pointed a finger straight down, emphatically, turned, and beat it to the stairs to the basement and on down. Flipping the light switch, I went and perched on the pool table. Two minutes. Three. Four, and there were footsteps. He stood at the door, glared at me, and spoke.
"I won't tolerate this."
I raised an eyebrow. "I could write it."

"Yes," Miss Hinckley said. "I'll go."
I could have hugged her. It would have been relevant to the job. I asked her, "Could you bring Mr. Yarmack?"
"I don't know. I'll try."
"Good." I rose. "The address is in the phone book."

"Pfui. Two points. One, the risk is extremely slight. Two, we can use it. As you talk you can insert comments or statements at will which I am to disregard, notifying me by raising a finger. I shall do the same. Of course making no reference to Mr. Cramer; we can't risk that; and maintaining our conclusion that the FBI killed that man, and we intend to establish it."

I raised a finger. "Your guess that they might have hit on the FBI theory at the "Gazette", and be working on it, wasn't so good." I lowered the finger. "Lon Cohen didn't mention it, so I didn't. They haven't got a theory. He let me go through the files, and we talked, and I got a dozen pages of names and assorted details, some of which might possibly be useful." I raised a finger. "I'll type it up at the usual five dollars a page." I lowered the finger. "Next I phoned Mrs. David Althaus from a booth, and she said she would see me, and I went. Park Avenue in the Eighties, tenth-floor apartment, all the trimmings you would expect.

 Pictures okay. I won't describe her because you'll see her. She quotes Leviticus and Aristotle." Finger raised. "I wanted to quote Plato but couldn't work it in." Finger lowered. "I had asked her on the phone to ask Marian Hinckley to come, and she said she would be there soon. She said she had understood me to say on the phone that her son had been killed by an agent of the FBI and was that correct. From there on you had better have it verbatim."
I gave it to him, straight through, knowing that I had said nothing we wouldn't be willing for the FBI to hear. Leaning back with his eyes closed, he wouldn't have been able to see a raised finger, so I couldn't make any insertions. When I finished he grunted, opened his eyes, and said, "It's bad enough when you know there's a needle in the haystack. When you don't even - "
The doorbell rang. Going to the hall for a look, I saw a G-man on the stoop. Not that I recognized him, but it must be - the right age, the broad shoulders, the manly mug with a firm jaw, the neat dark gray coat. I went and opened the door the two inches allowed by the chain bolt and said, "Yes, sir?"
==> He blurted through the crack, "My name's Quayle and I want to see Nero Wolfe!" <==
"Spell it, please?"
"Timothy Quayle! Q,U,A,Y,L,E!" "Mr. Wolfe is engaged. I'll see."
I went to the office door. "One of the names in my notebook. Timothy Quayle. Senior editor at "Tick-Tock" magazine. The hero type. He slugged a reporter who was annoying Marian Hinckley. She must have phoned him about you soon after I left."
"No," he growled.
"It's half an hour till dinner. Are you in the middle of a chapter?" He glowered at me. "Bring him."

Wolfe nodded. "Mr. Quayle."
He advanced to the desk. "I am a friend of Miss Marian Hinckley. I want to know what kind of a game you're playing. I want an explanation."
"Bah," Wolfe said.
"Don't bah me! What are you up to?"
"This is ridiculous," Wolfe said. "I like eyes at a level. If you can only blather at me, Mr. Goodwin will put you out. If you will take that chair, change your tone, and give me an acceptable reason why I should account to you, I may listen."

Quayle opened his mouth and shut it again. He turned his head to look at me, there on my feet, apparently to see if I was man enough. I would have liked it just as well if he had decided I wasn't, for after that night and day I would have welcomed an excuse to twist another arm. But he vetoed it, went to the red leather chair and sat, and scowled at Wolfe. "I know about you," he said. Not so blathery, but not at all sociable. "I know how you operate.

Quayle's situation was bad. With me standing there in front of him, if he started to leave the chair I could get about any hold I wanted while he was coming up. But my situation was bad too. Removing a 180-pound man from a padded armchair is a problem, and he had savvy enough to stay put, leaning back. But his feet weren't pulled in enough. I started my hands for his shoulders, then dived and got his ankles and yanked and kept going, and had him in the hall, on his back, before he could even try to counter, and then the damn fool tried to turn to get hand leverage on the floor.

We let go, and he scrambled to his feet. Fritz got his coat from the rack, but he said, "I want to go back in. I'm going to ask him something."
"No. You have bad manners. We'd have to bounce you again." "No you wouldn't. I want to "ask" him something."

"You wanted an acceptable reason," he told Wolfe. "As I said, I am a friend of Miss Hinckley. A good enough friend so that she called me on the phone to tell me about Goodwin - what he said to her and Mrs. Aithaus. I advised her not to come here this evening, but she's coming. At nine o'clock?"
"Yes."
"Then I'm going - " He stopped. That wasn't the way. It came hard, but he managed it. "I want to be here. Will you... May I come?"

==> At ten minutes past nine in the evening of that long day I went to the kitchen. Wolfe was at the center table with Fritz, arguing about the number of juniper berries to put in a marinade for venison loin chops. Knowing that that could go on and on, I said, "Excuse me. They're all here, and more. David Althaus, the father, came along. He's the bald one, to your right at the back. Also a lawyer named Bernard Fromm, to your left at the back. Long-headed and hard-eyed." <==
Wolfe frowned. "I don't want him." "Of course not. Shall I tell him so?"
"Confound it." He turned to Fritz. "Very well, proceed. I say three, but proceed as you will. If you put in five I won't even have to taste it; the smell will tell me. With four it might be palatable." He gave me a nod and I headed for the office, and he followed.
He circled around Mrs. Althaus in the red leather chair and stood while I pronounced names. There were two rows of yellow chairs, with Vincent Yannack, Marian Hinckley, and Timothy Quayle in front, and David Althaus and Bernard Fromm in the rear. That put Quayle nearest me, which had seemed advisable. Wolfe sat, sent his eyes left to right and back again, and spoke. "I should tell you that it may be that with an electronic eavesdropping device agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation hear everything that is said in this room. Mr. Goodwin and I think it unlikely, but it is quite possible. I feel that you -"
"Why would they?" Fromm the lawyer. The courtroom tone, cross-examination.
"That will appear, Mr. Fromm. I feel that you should be aware of that possibility, however remote. Now I beg you to indulge me. I'm going to talk a while. I can expect you to help further my interest only if I can demonstrate that your interest runs with mine. You are the father, the mother, the fiancee, and the associates of a man who was murdered seven weeks ago, and the murderer has not been exposed. I intend to expose him. I intend to establish that Morris Althaus was killed by an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That intention - "

I can expect you to help further my interest only if I can demonstrate that your interest runs with mine. You are the father, the mother, the fiancee, and the associates of a man who was murdered seven weeks ago, and the murderer has not been exposed. I intend to expose him. I intend to establish that Morris Althaus was killed by an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That intention - "

Time's up," I said, and took his arm to turn him.

At ten minutes past nine in the evening of that long day I went to the kitchen. Wolfe was at the center table with Fritz, arguing about the number of juniper berries to put in a marinade for venison loin chops. Knowing that that could go on and on, I said, "Excuse me. They're all here, and more. David Althaus, the father, came along. He's the bald one, to your right at the back. Also a lawyer named Bernard Fromm, to your left at the back. Long-headed and hard-eyed."
Wolfe frowned. "I don't want him." "Of course not. Shall I tell him so?"
"Confound it." He turned to Fritz. "Very well, proceed. I say three, but proceed as you will. If you put in five I won't even have to taste it; the smell will tell me. With four it might be palatable." He gave me a nod and I headed for the office, and he followed.
==> He circled around Mrs. Althaus in the red leather chair and stood while I pronounced names. There were two rows of yellow chairs, with Vincent Yannack, Marian Hinckley, and Timothy Quayle in front, and David Althaus and Bernard Fromm in the rear. That put Quayle nearest me, which had seemed advisable. Wolfe sat, sent his eyes left to right and back again, and spoke. "I should tell you that it may be that with an electronic eavesdropping device agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation hear everything that is said in this room. Mr. Goodwin and I think it unlikely, but it is quite possible. I feel that you -" <==
"Why would they?" Fromm the lawyer. The courtroom tone, cross-examination.
"That will appear, Mr. Fromm. I feel that you should be aware of that possibility, however remote. Now I beg you to indulge me. I'm going to talk a while.

I intend to establish that Morris Althaus was killed by an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That intention - "

ey made two demands simultaneously. Yarmack demanded, "How?" and Fromm demanded, "Why?"
Wolfe nodded. "That intention stands on two legs. Recently I undertook a job which made it necessary for me to make inquiries regarding certain activities of the FBI, and they retaliated immediately by trying to have me deprived of my license as a private investigator. They may succeed; but even if they do, as a private citizen I can pursue an investigation in my private interest, and it will certainly be in my interest to discredit their pretension that they are faultless champions of law and justice. That's one leg. The other leg is my long-standing grievance against the Homicide Squad of the New York Police Department. They too have pretensions. On numerous occasions they have hampered my legitimate activities. They have threatened more than once to prosecute me for withholding evidence or obstructing justice. It would be gratifying to me to reciprocate, to demonstrate that they know or suspect that the FBI is implicated in a murder and "they" are obstructing justice. That would also - "

"You're talking plenty," Fromm cut in. "Can you back it up?"
"By inference, yes. The police and the District Attorney know that Morris Althaus had been collecting material for an article about the FBI, but they found no such material in his apartment. Mr. Yarmack. I believe you were involved in that project?"
Vincent Yarmack was more my idea of a senior editor than Timothy Quayle - round sloping shoulders, tight little mouth, and eyes so pale you had to guess they were there behind the black-rimmed cheaters.
"I was," he said in a voice that was close to a squeak.
"And Mr. Althaus "had" collected material?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 76483    window = 76478 76488


"I thought it was in his possession. But I have been told by the police that there was nothing about the FBI in his apartment."
"Didn't you draw an inference from that?"

Well...one inference was obvious, that someone had taken it. It wasn't likely that Morris had put it somewhere else."
"Mrs. Althaus told Mr. Goodwin this afternoon that you suspected it was the FBI. Is that correct?"
==> Yarmack turned his head for a glance at Mrs. Althaus, and back to Wolfe. "I may have given her that impression in a private conversation. This conversation isn't very private, according to you." <==
Wolfe grunted. "I said the eavesdropping is possible but not verified. If you drew that inference, certainly the police would." His eyes moved. "Wouldn't they, Mr. Fromm?"
The lawyer nodded. "Presumably. But that doesn't warrant a conclusion that they are obstructing justice."
"A conclusion, no. A surmise, yes. If not obstruction, at least nonfeasance. As a member of the bar, you are aware of the tenacity of the police and the District Attorney in an unsolved murder case. If they - "
"I don't practice criminal law."
"Pfui. Surely you are aware of what every child knows. If they were not satisfied with the assumption that the FBI is responsible for the disappearance of that material and therefore was probably involved in the murder, they would certainly he exploring other possibilities - for instance, Mr. Yarmack. Are they, Mr. Yarmack? Are they harassing you?"

 I am merely showing that the police are either shirking or slighting their duty. Unless you have given them an impregnable alibi for the night of November twentieth. Have you?"
"No. Impregnable, no."
"Have you, Mr. Quayle?"
"Nuts," Quayle said. Bad manners again.
==> Wolfe eyed him. "You are here by sufferance. You wanted to know what I am up to. I am making that clear. Impelled solely by my private interest, I hope to disclose the implication of the FBI in a murder and the failure of the police to do their duty. In that effort I must guard against the danger of being balked by circumstance. Yesterday I received in confidence information strongly indicating the guilt of the FBI, but it is not conclusive. I dare not ignore the possibility that the apparent inaction of the police is merely tactical, that they and the FBI both know the identity of the murderer, and that they are holding off until they have decisive evidence. I must be fully satisfied on that point before I move. You can help to satisfy me, and if instead you choose to flout me I don't want you here. Mr. Goodwin has ejected you once and he can do so again if necessary. He would be even more effective with an audience; he likes an audience as well as I do. If you prefer to stay, I asked you a question." <==
Quayle's jaw was set. The poor guy was in a fix. Seated next to him, so close he could have reached out and touched her, was the girl for whom and before whom he had pitched into a nosy newshound, begging Lon Cohen's pardon, and now he was being crowded by a nosy bloodhound. I expected him to turn his head, either to her to show that for her sake he could swallow even his pride, or to me to show that I was really no problem, but he stayed focused on Wolfe.
"I told you I would control myself," he said. "All right. I have no impregnable alibi for the night of November twentieth. That answers your question, and now I ask one. How do you expect Miss Hinckley to help to satisfy you?"
Wolfe nodded. "That's reasonable and relevant. Miss Hinckley, manifestly you are willing to help or you wouldn't be here. I have suggested a theory to account for the guilt of Mr. Yarmack; now one for Mr. Quayle. That's simple. Millions of men have killed a fellow man because of a woman - to spite her or bereave her or get her. If Mr. Quayle killed your fiance do you want him exposed?"

 She lifted her hands and let them drop. "But that's ridiculous."

"You can't expect me to answer that."

"Indeed. By right? Was it a trespass?"
"I don't know about 'right.' I had asked Miss Hinckley to marry me. I had ex - I had hoped she would."
"Had she agreed to?"
==> The lawyer cut in. "Take it easy, Wolfe. You mentioned trespass. I think you're trespassing. I'm here at the request of Mr. Althaus, my client, and I'm not entitled to speak on behalf of Miss Hinckley or Mr. Quayle, but I think you're overreaching. I know your reputation. I know you're not a jobber, and I won't challenge your bona fides unless I have reason, but as an attorney-at-law I have to say you're spreading it pretty thick. Or perhaps I mean thin. Mr. Althaus, and his wife, and I as his attorney, certainly want to see justice done. But if you have received information strongly indicating the guilt of the FBI, why this inquisition?" <==
"I thought I made that plain."
"As an explanation of a position, yes, or as a brief for prudence. Not as an excuse for an inquisition of persons. Next you will be asking me if Morris had caught me committing a felony."
"Had he?"
"I'm not going to fill a role in a burlesque. I repeat, you're overreaching."
"Then I'll pull in, but I shall not abandon prudence. I'll ask you this, a routine question in any case of death by violence: If the FBI didn't kill Morris Althaus,

 who did? Assume that the FBI is definitely cleared and I am the District Attorney. Who had reason to want that man dead? Who hated him or feared him or had something to gain? Can you suggest a name?"
"No. I have considered that, naturally. No."

"The question is routine," Wolfe said, "but it is not always futile. I ask you to reflect. Without regard for slander; you will not be quoted. Surely Morris Althaus did not live thirty-six years without giving offense to anyone. He offended his father. He offended Mr. Quayle." He looked at Yarmack. "Were the articles he wrote for your magazine innocuous?"
"No," the editor said. "But if they hurt anyone enough for them to murder him I shouldn't think they would wait until now."
"One of them had to wait," Quayle said. "He was in jail." Wolfe switched editors. "For what?"
"Fraud. A shady real-estate deal. Morris did a piece we called 'The Realty Racket,' and it started an investigation, and one of them got nailed. He was sent up for two years. That was two years ago, a little less, but with time off for good behavior he must be out by now. But he's no murderer, he wouldn't have the guts. I saw him a couple of times when he was trying to get us to leave his name out. He's just a small-time smoothie."

Wolfe nodded. "So I assumed. Otherwise you would be harassed not only by the police. Had he told you nothing of his discoveries and conjectures?"
"No. He never did. He waited until he had a first draft. That was how he always worked."
Wolfe grunted. "Madam," he told Mrs. Althaus, "as I said, I must be satisfied. I should ask a thousand questions - all night, all week. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is a formidable foe, entrenched in power and privilege. It is not rodomontade but merely a statement of fact to say that no individual or group in America would undertake the job I have assigned myself. If an agent of the FBI killed your son there is not the slightest chance that he will be brought to account unless I do it. Therefore the choice of procedure is exclusively mine. Is that overreaching, Mr. Fromm?"

"No," the lawyer said. "It would be unrealistic not to agree with you about the FBI. When I learned that nothing about them was found in the apartment I made the obvious assumption, and I told Mr. Althaus that I thought it very unlikely that the murderer would ever be caught. The FBI is untouchable. Goodwin told Mrs. Althaus that a man told you yesterday that he knows that an FBI agent killed her son, and that he supported it with information, and I came here intending to demand the man's name and the information, but you're right. The procedure is up to you. I think it's hopeless, but I wish you luck, and I wish I could help."
"So do I." Wolfe pushed his chair back and rose. "It's possible, if this conversation has been overheard, that one or more of you "will" be harassed. If so I would like to know. I would like to know of any development that comes to your knowledge, however trivial. Whether the conversation was overheard or not, this house is under surveillance, and the FBI now knows that I am concerning myself with the murder of Morris Althaus. The police do not, as far as I know, and I request you not to tell them; that would only make it more difficult. I apologize for not offering you refreshment; I was preoccupied. Mr. Althaus, you have not spoken. Do you wish to?"
"No," David Althaus said - his one and only word. "Then good evening." Wolfe walked out.

"I don't understand - " Mrs. Althaus began, but it came out hoarse and she cleared her throat. She was looking at Wolfe. "I don't understand all this. If it was the FBI, why are you asking all these questions? Why don't you ask Mr. Yarmack what Morris had found out about the FBI? I have asked him, and he says he doesn't know."

," Yarmack said.
Wolfe nodded. "So I assumed. Otherwise you would be harassed not only by the police. Had he told you nothing of his discoveries and conjectures?"
"No. He never did. He waited until he had a first draft. That was how he always worked."
==> Wolfe grunted. "Madam," he told Mrs. Althaus, "as I said, I must be satisfied. I should ask a thousand questions - all night, all week. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is a formidable foe, entrenched in power and privilege. It is not rodomontade but merely a statement of fact to say that no individual or group in America would undertake the job I have assigned myself. If an agent of the FBI killed your son there is not the slightest chance that he will be brought to account unless I do it. Therefore the choice of procedure is exclusively mine. Is that overreaching, Mr. Fromm?" <==
"No," the lawyer said. "It would be unrealistic not to agree with you about the FBI. When I learned that nothing about them was found in the apartment I made the obvious assumption, and I told Mr. Althaus that I thought it very unlikely that the murderer would ever be caught. The FBI is untouchable. Goodwin told Mrs. Althaus that a man told you yesterday that he knows that an FBI agent killed her son, and that he supported it with information, and I came here intending to demand the man's name and the information, but you're right. The procedure is up to you. I think it's hopeless, but I wish you luck, and I wish I could help."
"So do I." Wolfe pushed his chair back and rose. "It's possible, if this conversation has been overheard, that one or more of you "will" be harassed. If so I would like to know. I would like to know of any development that comes to your knowledge, however trivial. Whether the conversation was overheard or not, this house is under surveillance, and the FBI now knows that I am concerning myself with the murder of Morris Althaus. The police do not, as far as I know, and I request you not to tell them; that would only make it more difficult. I apologize for not offering you refreshment; I was preoccupied. Mr. Althaus, you have not spoken. Do you wish to?"
"No," David Althaus said - his one and only word. "Then good evening." Wolfe walked out.

As they left their chairs and moved toward the hall I stood. The gentlemen could help the ladies with their coats; I wasn't needed. I must have been about as low as you can get, for it didn't occur to me that it would be a pleasure to hold Miss Hinckley's coat until I heard the front door open, and then it was too late. I stayed put until I heard it close and then went and bolted it. They were down on the sidewalk.
I hadn't heard the elevator, so Wolfe must be in the kitchen, and I headed for it. But he wasn't. Neither was Fritz. Had he actually climbed the stairs? Why? The only other way was down. I chose that, and as I descended I heard his voice. It came from the open door to Fritz's room, and I stepped to it and entered.

Fritz could have had a room upstairs, but he prefers the basement. His den is as big as the office and front room combined, but over the years it has got pretty cluttered - tables with stacks of magazines, busts of Escoffier and Brillat-Savarin on stands, framed menus on the walls, a king-size bed, five chairs, shelves of books (he has 289 cookbooks), a head of a wild boar he shot in the Vosges, a TV and stereo cabinet, two large cases of ancient cooking vessels, one of which he thinks was used by Julius Caesar's chef, and so on.

Wolfe was in the biggest chair by a table, with a bottle of beer and a glass. Fritz, seated across from him, got up as I entered, but I moved another chair up.
"It's too bad," I said, "that the elevator doesn't come down. Maybe we can have it done."
Wolfe drank beer, put the glass down, and licked his lips. "I want to know," he said, "about those electronic abominations. Could we be heard here?"
"I don't know. I've read about a thing that is supposed to pick up voices half a mile off, but I don't know about how much area it covers or about obstructions like walls and floors. There could be items I haven't read about that can take a whole house. If there aren't there soon will be. People will have to talk with their hands."

He glared at me. Since I had done nothing to deserve it, I glared back. "You realize," he said, "that absolute privacy has never been so imperative."
"I do. God knows I do."

"We could do that in the office."
"Yes, sir.
"Why the devil didn't you suggest it?"
I nodded. "You're in a stew. So am I. I'm surprised I thought of it now. Let's try it here. In the office I'd have to lean across your desk."
He turned. "If you please, Fritz. It doesn't matter what."
==> Fritz went to the cabinet and turned a knob, and soon a woman was telling a man she was sorry she had ever met him. He asked (not the man, Fritz) if it was loud enough, and I said a little louder and moved my chair nearer Wolfe. He leaned forward and growled, eighteen inches from my ear, "We'll prepare for a contingency. Do you know if the Ten for Aristology is still in existence?" <==
My shoulders went up and down. It takes a moron or a genius to ask a question that has no bearing whatever. "No," I said. "That was seven years ago. It probably is. I can ring Lewis Hewitt."
"Not from here."
"I'll go to a booth. Now?"
"Yes. If he says that group still - No. Whatever he says about the Ten for Aristology, ask him if I may call on him tomorrow morning to consult him on an urgent private matter. If he invites me to lunch, as he will, accept."
"He lives on Long Island the year around."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 76571    window = 76566 76576


"We won't need to. If I am seen going to him so much the better." "Then why not call him from here?"
"Because I'm willing, I even wish, to have my visit to him known, but not that I invited myself."

What if he can't make it tomorrow?"
"Then as soon as possible."
==> I went. As I mounted to the hall and got my coat and hat and let myself out and headed for Ninth Avenue, I was thinking, two rules down the drain in one day - the morning schedule and not leaving the house on business - and why? The Ten for Aristology was a bunch of ten well-heeled men who were, to quote, "pursuing the ideal of perfection in food and drink." Seven years back, at the home of one of them, Benjamin Schriver, the shipping tycoon, they had met to pursue their ideal by eating and drinking, and Lewis Hewitt, a member, had arranged with Wolfe for Fritz to cook the dinner. Naturally Wolfe and I had been invited and had gone, and the guy between us at the table had been fed arsenic with the first course, caviar on blinis topped with sour cream, and had died. Quite a party. It had not affected Wolfe's relations with Lewis Hewitt, who was still grateful for a special favor Wolfe had done him long ago, who had a hundred-foot-long orchid house at his Long Island estate, and who came to dinner at the old brownstone about twice a year. <==
It took a while to get him because the call had to be switched to the greenhouse or the stables or maybe the john, but it was a pleasure for him to hear my voice; he said so. When I told him Wolfe would like to pay him a call he said he would be delighted and that of course we would lunch with him, and added that he would like to ask Wolfe a question regarding the lunch.
"I'm afraid I'll have to do," I told him. "I'm calling from a booth in a drugstore. Excuse my glove, but is there any chance that someone is on an extension?"
"Why - why no. There would he no reason..."
"Okay. I'm calling from a booth because our wire is tapped and Mr. Wolfe doesn't want it known that he suggested calling on you. So don't ring our number. It's conceivable that you might get a call tomorrow afternoon from someone who says he's a reporter and wants to ask questions. I mention it now because I might forget to tomorrow. The idea is, this appointment, our coming to lunch tomorrow, was made last week. All right?"
"Yes, of course. But good heavens, if you know your phone is tapped - isn't that illegal?"

Sure, that's why it's fun. We'll tell you about it tomorrow - I "guess" we will." He said he would save his curiosity for tomorrow and would expect us by noon.
There is a TV set and a radio in the office, and when I got back I was expecting to see Wolfe there in his favorite chair, probably with the radio going, but the office was empty, so I proceeded to the rear and down to the basement and found him where I had left him. The television was still on, and Fritz was sitting watching it, yawning. Wolfe was leaning back with his eyes shut, and his lips were going, pushing out and then in, out and in. So he was working, but on what? I stood and looked at him. That's the one thing I never break in on, the lip operation, but that time I had to clamp my jaw to keep my mouth shut because I didn't believe it. There was absolutely nothing he could be hatching. Two full minutes. Three. I decided he was only practicing, it was a dry run, went to a chair, sat, and coughed loud. In a moment he opened his eyes, blinked at me, and straightened up.
I moved my chair closer. "All set," I said. "We're expected by noon, so we should roll by ten-thirty."

"You're not going," he growled. "I telephoned Saul. He'll come at nine." "Oh. I see. You want me here in case Wragg sends them to confess."
"I want you to find Frank Odell."
"For God's sake. Is "that" what your lips squeezed out."
"No." He turned his head. "A little louder, Fritz." Back to me: "I said after lunch that you had made it clear that it would be futile to establish that the FBI committed that murder. I retract that. I will not bow to futility. We must arrange a situation in which none of the three alternatives would be futile. They are: one, establish that the FBI committed the murder; two, establish that they didn't; and three, establish neither one, let the murder go. We prefer by far the second alternative, and that is why you are to find Frank Odell, but if we are forced to accept the first or the third we must manage circumstances so that we will nevertheless be in a position to fulfill our obligation to our client."

 "All right, 'we' and 'our.'"
"That's better. Just so, our best efforts. The strongest obligation possible for a man with self-esteem, and we both have our full share of that. One point is vital. No matter which alternative circumstances compel us to accept, Mr. Wragg must believe, or at least suspect, that one of his men killed Morris Althaus. I can contrive no maneuver by us that would contribute to that; I was trying to when you returned. Can you?"
"No. He either believes it or he doesn't. Ten to one he does."

==> No response. I turned. He was sound asleep in the chair, probably snoring, but if so the TV covered it. I suggested moving to the office and trying some WQXR music for a change, and Wolfe agreed, so we woke Fritz and thanked him for his hospitality and told him good night. On the way to the office I stopped off for beer for Wolfe and milk for me, and when I joined him he had the radio going and was back of his desk. Since it was going to take time I brought a yellow chair and put it near his. He poured beer, and I took a swallow of milk and said, "I forgot to say that I didn't ask Hewitt about the Ten for Aristology. You wanted to see him anyway and you can ask him tomorrow. And the program?" <==
He spoke.
It was well after midnight when he went to the elevator and I went to get the sheets and blankets and pillow for my second night on the couch.

There were more than a hundred Odells in the phone books of the five boroughs, but no Frank. That established, I sat at my desk at half past nine Friday morning and considered recourses. It wasn't the kind of problem to discuss with Wolfe, and anyway he wasn't available. Saul Panzer had come at nine o'clock on the dot, and instead of going up to the plant rooms Wolfe had come down, put on his heavy overcoat and broad-brimmed beaver hat, and followed Saul out to the curb to climb into the Heron sedan. Of course he knew that the heater, if turned on

 full, could make the inside of the Heron like an oven, but he took the heavy coat because he distrusted all machines more complicated than a wheelbarrow. He would have been expecting to be stranded at some wild and lonely spot in the Long Island jungle even if I had been driving.
It took will power to fasten my mind on the Frank Odell caper, which was merely a stab in the dark blindfolded, ordered by Wolfe only because he preferred the second of the three alternatives. Where my mind wanted to be was on Long Island. In all my experience of Wolfe's arrangements of circumstances I had never known him to concoct anything as tricky as the program he was going to rope Lewis Hewitt in for, and I should have been there. Genius is fine for the ignition spark, but to get there someone has to see that the radiator doesn't leak and no tire is flat. I would have insisted on going if it hadn't been for Saul Panzer. Wolfe had said that Saul would sit in, and he is the one man I would turn any problem over to if I broke a leg.
I forced my mind onto Frank Odell. The obvious thing was to ring the New York State Parole Division and ask if they had him listed. But of course not on our phone. If the FBI knew that we were spending time and money on Odell after what Quayle had said about him, they would know it wasn't just prudence, that we thought there was actually a chance that he was involved, and that wouldn't do. I decided to play it absolutely safe. If some G-man reads this and thinks I'm overrating his outfit, he isn't inside far enough to know all the family secrets. I'm not inside at all, but I've been around a lot.
After going to the kitchen to tell Fritz I was leaving and to the hall for my coat and hat, I let myself out, walked to Tenth Avenue and on to the garage, got permission from Tom Halloran to use the phone, dialed the "Gazette" number, and got Lon Cohen. He was discreet. He didn't ask me how we were making out with Mrs. Bruner and the FBI. He did ask if I knew where he could get a bottle of brandy.

==>  look. Wolfe buys a new one every year, thinking that reduces the risk of a collapse, which it doesn't, and he leaves the choice to me. I have been tempted to get a Rolls, but it would be a shame to ditch it after only a year. That day there was nothing on the floor I would have traded the Heron for. Tom and I were discussing the dashboard of a 45 Lincoln when the phone rang and I went. It was Lon, and he had it. Frank Odell had been released in August and would be on parole until the end of February. He lived at 2553 Lamont Avenue, Bronx, and he had a job at a branch of the Driscoll Renting Agency at 4618 Grand Concourse. Lon said that a good way to start rehabilitating him would be to get him in a poker game, and I said I thought craps would be better. <==
I decided to take the subway instead of a taxi, not to save the client money, but because I thought it was about time to do something about tails. There had been two days and nights since the FBI had presumably got interested in us, and twenty-five hours since they had asked Perazzo to take our licenses, and I still had seen no sign that I had company. Of course I had dodged or hadn't looked. I now decided to look, but not while walking. I waited until I was at the Grand Central subway station and had boarded an uptown express.
If you think you have a tail on a subway train and want to spot him you keep moving while the train is under way, and at each station you stand close enough to a door so that you might get off. At a rush hour it's difficult, but it was ten- thirty in the morning and we were going uptown. I had him by the time we made the third stop - or rather, them. There were two. One was a chunky specimen, barely tall enough to meet the specifications, with big brown eyes that he didn't know how to handle, and the other was the Gregory Peck type except for his curly little ears. The game, just for the hell of it, was to spot them without their knowing I had, and when I got off at the l70th Street station I was pretty sure I had won it. Out on the sidewalk again, I ignored them.
Tailing on New York streets, if you know you have it and want to shake it and aren't a birdbrain, is a joke. There are a thousand dodges, and the tallee merely picks the one that fits the time and place. There on Tremont Avenue I moseyed along, glancing occasionally at my wristwatch and at the numbers on doors, until I saw an empty taxi coming. When it was thirty yards away I scooted between parked cars, flagged it, hopped in, told the hackie as I pulled the door shut, "Step on it," and saw Gregory Peck stare at me as we went by. The other one was across the street. We did seven blocks before a red light stopped us, so that was that. I admit I had kept an eye on the rear. I gave the driver the Grand Concourse address, and the light changed, and we rolled.

Some realty agency branch offices are upstairs, but that one was on the ground floor of an apartment building, of course one of the buildings it serviced. I entered. It was small, two desks and a table and a filing cabinet. A beautiful young lady with enough black hair for a Beatle was at the nearest desk, and when she smiled at me and asked if she could help me, I had to take a breath to keep my head from swimming. They should stay home during business hours. I told her I would like to see Mr. Odell, and she turned her beautiful head and nodded to the rear.
He was at the other desk. I had waited to see him before deciding on the approach, and one look was enough. Some men, after a hitch in the jug, even a short one, have got a permanent wilt, but not him. In size he was a peanut, but an elegant peanut. Fair-skinned and fair-haired, he was more than fair-dressed. His pin-stripe gray suit had set him, or somebody, back at least two Cs.
He left his chair to come, said he was Frank Odell, and offered a hand. It would have been simpler if he had had a room to himself; possibly she didn't know she was cooped up with a jailbird. I said I was Archie Goodwin, got out my case, and handed him a card. He gave it a good look, stuck it in his pocket, and said, "My goodness, I should have recognized you. From your picture in the paper."
==> My picture hadn't been in the paper for fourteen months, and he had been behind bars, but I didn't make an issue of it. "I'm beginning to show my years," I told him. "Can you give me a few minutes? Nero Wolfe has taken on a little job involving a man named Morris Althaus and he thinks you might be able to furnish some information." <==
He didn't bat an eye. No wilt. He merely said, "That's the man that was murdered."
"Right. Of course the police have been around about that. Routine. This is just a private investigation on a side issue."
"If you mean the police have been "here", they haven't. We might as well sit down." He moved to his desk, and I followed and took a chair at its end. "What's the side issue?" he asked.
"It's a little complicated. It's about some research he was doing at the time he was killed. You may know something about it if you saw him during that period

1. Mrs. Bruner had distributed copies of that book.
2. Morris Althaus had been collecting material for a piece on the FBI.
3. G-men had killed Althaus, or at least had been in his apartment about the tune he was killed.
4. Althaus had met Mrs. Bruner. He had been in her house.
5. A man who had worked for Mrs. Bruner's firm had been jailed (made the goat?) as a result of a piece Althaus had written.
==> That was no coincidence; it was cause and effect in a hell of a mess. I started to sort it out but soon found that there were so many combinations and possibilities that you could even come up with the notion that Mrs. Bruner had shot Althaus, which wouldn't do, since she was the client. The one conclusion was that there "was" a needle in "this" haystack, and it had to be found. Wolfe had stolen another base. He had merely asked Yarmack if the articles Althaus had written for "Tick-Tock" were innocuous, and had merely told me to find Odell because he couldn't think of anything sensible for me, and here was this. <==
I couldn't have called Wolfe even if he had been at home, and I decided not to ring him at Hewitt's. Not only does a place like that have a dozen or more extensions, but also G-men had probably followed him there, since Saul had been told to ignore tails, and tapping a line in the country was a cinch for them. I happen to know that they once - But I'll skip it.
But I was not going to go home and sit on it until he got back. I found a phone

 booth, dialed Mrs. Bruner's number and got her, and asked if she could meet me at Rusterman's at twelve-thirty for lunch. She said she could. I rang Rusterman's and got Felix and asked if I could have the soundproofed room upstairs, the small one. He said I could. I went out and got a taxi.
Rusterman's has lost some of the standing it had when Marko Vukcic was alive. Wolfe is no longer the trustee, but he still goes there about once a month and Felix comes to the old brownstone now and then for advice. When Wolfe goes, taking Fritz and me, we eat in the small room upstairs, and we always start with the queen of soups, Germiny a l'Oseille. So I knew that room well. Felix was there with me, being sociable, when Mrs. Bruner came, only ten minutes late.

She wanted a double dry martini with onion. You never know; I would have guessed hers would be sherry or Dubonnet, and certainly not the onion. When it came she took three healthy sips in a row, looked to see that the waiter had closed the door, and said, "Of course I didn't ask you on the phone. Something has happened?"

The least you can do is tell us everything that could conceivably have a bearing on it. The fact that you had known Morris Althaus, at least you had met him, naturally suggests questions. Did you know he was working at a piece on the FBI? Let me finish. Did you know or suspect that the FBI was involved in his murder? Was that why you sent those books? Was that why you came to Nero Wolfe? Just stay in the buggy. We simply have to know everything you know, that's all." <==
She did all right. A woman who can toss you a check for a hundred grand without blinking hasn't had much practice listening to reason from a hireling, but she managed it. She didn't count ten, at least not audibly, but she picked up her glass and drank, gave me a straight look, put the glass down, and spoke. "I didn't 'conceal' anything. It just didn't occur to me to mention Morris Althaus. Or perhaps it did occur to me while I was thinking about it, but not while I was talking to Mr. Wolfe. Because it was just - I didn't really "know" anything. I don't know anything now. I had read about the murder and remembered that I had met him, but the only connection it had with the FBI was what Miss Dacos, my secretary, had told me, and that was just a girl talking. She didn't really

 "know" anything either. It had nothing to do with my sending the books. I sent them because I had read it, and I thought it was important for important people to read it. Does that answer your questions?"
"Pretty well, but it raises another one. Just keep in mind that I'm working on your job. What had Miss Dacos told you?"
"Nothing but talk. She lived at the same address, she still does. Her - " "What same address?"

"Just questions. For instance, about Morris Althaus. How well did you know him?"
"I didn't know him at all."
"He came at least once to your house - your office. According to Odell."
She nodded. "That's right, he did. I remembered that when I read about him - the murder." Her chin was up. "I don't like your tone, Mr. Goodwin. Are you intimating that I have concealed something?"

"The same as that man, Morris Aithaus. In the Village. Her apartment is on the second floor, below his. She was out that evening, and soon after - "
"The night he was killed?"
"Yes. Stop interrupting me. Soon after she returned to her apartment she heard footsteps outside, people going down the stairs, and she was curious about who it might be. She went to the window and looked out and saw three men leave the house and walk to the corner, and she thought they were FBI men. The only reason she had for thinking they were FBI men was that they looked like it; she said they were 'the type.' As I said, she didn't "know" anything, and I didn't know there was any connection between Morris Althaus and the FBI. You asked if I knew he was working on a piece on the FBI. No, not until you told me. I resent your suggestion that I concealed something." She looked at her wristwatch. "It's after one o'clock, and I have an appointment at half past two, a committee meeting that I must be on time for."
I pushed a button, two shorts, on a slab on the table, and begged her pardon for asking her to lunch and then starving her. In a couple of minutes Pierre came with the lobster bisque, and I told him to bring the squabs in ten minutes without waiting for a ring.
==> There was a little question of etiquette. As a matter of business it would have been proper to tell her that neither Nero Wolfe nor I was ever allowed to pay for anything we or our guests ate at Rusterman's, so it wouldn't be an item on the expense account, but such a remark didn't seem to fit with Squabs "a la Moscovite", Mushrooms "Polonaise", "Salade Beatrice", and "Souffle Armenonville". I vetoed it. I didn't resume on Miss Dacos, but our only known common interest was the FBI. I learned that she had received 607 letters <==

 thanking her for the book, most of them just a polite sentence or two; 184 disapproving letters, some pretty strong; and 29 anonymous letters and cards calling her names. I was surprised that it was only 29; out of the 10,000 there must have been a couple of hundred members of the John Birch Society and similar outfits.
With the coffee I returned to Miss Dacos, having done some calculating. If Wolfe left Hewitt's at four o'clock he would get back around five-thirty, but he might leave later, say five, and arrive at six-thirty, in need of refreshment after the dangerous trip in the dark of night surrounded by thousands of treacherous machines. It would have to be after dinner. When Pierre left after serving coffee I told Mrs. Bruner, "Of course Mr. Wolfe will have to see Miss Dacos. She may know nothing, as you say, but he'll have to satisfy himself on that. Will you tell her to be here at nine o'clock this evening? In this room. Our office may be bugged."
"But I told you it was just a girl talking."
I said she was probably right, but one of Wolfe's specialties was prying something useful out of people who just talk, and when she finished her coffee I took her to Felix's office in the rear, and she got Miss Dacos on the phone and arranged it.

I had slipped up on one point; I hadn't asked if Miss Dacos had been present when Morris Althaus and Frank Odell had talked with Mrs. Bruner in her office. Of course Miss Dacos could tell us, but it was the kind of detail that Wolfe expects me to cover, and I expect me to too. How good a guess was it that it was Sarah Dacos who had told the cops about the three men? Not good at all, unless she had dressed it up or down either for the cops or for Mrs. Bruner. She couldn't see them go to a car around the corner, and get the license number, from the window of Number 63. Then we could be getting corroboration, but for the first alternative, that the FBI killed him, not for the one we preferred. But so what, since it was no longer futile, according to Wolfe's program.
I remembered how, crossing Washington Square yesterday on my sightseeing trip, I had thought it was coincidence that Arbor Street was in the Village and Sarah Dacos lived in the Village. Now it might be more than coincidence; it

At three o'clock I went to Felix's office and called Lewis Hewitt's number. There's something wrong with the way the people in that palace handle phone calls. It took a good four minutes, but finally Wolfe's voice came.

"Coming there?"

"What young woman?"
"Sarah Dacos, Mrs. Bruner's secretary. I'll report when you come. ""If" I come. Very well." He hung up.

All I wanted to know was if she had ever heard her son mention a girl named Sarah Dacos, but I had three hours to kill, so I might as well take a walk. I asked if she would let me in if I came around four-thirty, and she said yes. On the way out I told Felix that Wolfe and I would be there for dinner. <==

I was back in the soundproofed room, on my fanny with my legs stretched out

 and my eyes focused on my toes, going over the mess for the tenth time, when Wolfe arrived at twenty minutes to seven, ushered in by Felix. Knowing that was the busiest time of day downstairs for Felix, I shooed him out and took Wolfe's coat and hung it up and said I hoped he had had an interesting trip.
He growled and went and sat in the armchair which Marko Vukcic had bought years ago for his friend Nero's exclusive use. Between Wolfe's visits it is kept in the room that was Marko's personal den. "I have decided," he said, "that every man alive today is half idiot and half hero. Only heroes could survive in the maelstrom, and only idiots would want to."

I went and took a chair. "My report may not be satisfactory, but it has its points. To begin at the end, Mrs. Althaus says that she never heard her son mention Sarah Dacos."

His eyes opened. "Pfui. I can say satisfactory, and I do. Satisfactory. But you could have proceeded. You could have had that woman here this afternoon instead of this evening."
I nodded. "You're not only bored, your connections are jammed. You said we prefer by far the second alternative, so we certainly want to know if there is any chance of getting it. Sarah Dacos was there in the house, if not when he was shot, soon after. It's possible she can settle it, one way or the other. If you want - "
The door opened, and Pierre entered with a loaded tray. I glanced at my watch: 7:15. So he had told Felix a quarter past seven; by gum, he was hanging on to one rule at least, and he would certainly hang on to another one, no business talk at the table. He got up and left the room to wash his hands. By the time he got back Pierre had the mussels served and was waiting to hold his chair. He sat, forked a mussel to his mouth, used his tongue and teeth on it, swallowed, nodded, and said, "Mr. Hewitt has bloomed four crosses between "Miltonia sanderae" and "Odontoglossum pyramus". One of them is worth naming."
So they had found time to visit the orchid house.
==> Around half past eight Felix came and asked if he could have a minute to discuss the problem of shipping "langoustes" from France by air. It developed that what he really wanted was Wolfe's approval of frozen "langoustes", and of course he didn't get it. But he was stubborn, and they were still at it when Pierre ushered Sarah Dacos in. She was right on time. As I took her coat she accepted my offer of coffee, so I put her in a chair at the table and waited until Felix had gone to tell Wolfe her name. <==
He sizes a man up, but not a woman, because of his conviction that any opinion formed of any woman is sure to be wrong. He looked at Sarah Dacos, of course, since he was to talk to her. He told her that he supposed Mrs. Bruner had told her of her conversation with me.
She wasn't as chipper as she had been in her office; the hazel eyes weren't so lively. Mrs. Bruner had said that she had just talked; perhaps, sent to tell Nero Wolfe about it, she was feeling that she had just talked too much. She said yes, Mrs. Bruner had told her.
Wolfe blinked at her. The light there wasn't like the office, and besides, his eyes had had a hard day. "My interest is centered on Morris Althaus," he said. "Did

 you know him well?"

He sizes a man up, but not a woman, because of his conviction that any opinion formed of any woman is sure to be wrong. He looked at Sarah Dacos, of course, since he was to talk to her. He told her that he supposed Mrs. Bruner had told her of her conversation with me.
==> She wasn't as chipper as she had been in her office; the hazel eyes weren't so lively. Mrs. Bruner had said that she had just talked; perhaps, sent to tell Nero Wolfe about it, she was feeling that she had just talked too much. She said yes, Mrs. Bruner had told her. <==
Wolfe blinked at her. The light there wasn't like the office, and besides, his eyes had had a hard day. "My interest is centered on Morris Althaus," he said. "Did

 you know him well?"
She shook her head. "Not really, no. "You lived under the same roof."
"Well... that doesn't mean anything in New York, you know that. I moved there about a year ago, and when we met in the hall one day we realized we had met before - at Mrs. Bruner's office, the day he was there with that man, Odell. After that we had dinner together sometimes - maybe twice a month."

The door opened, and Pierre entered with a loaded tray. I glanced at my watch: 7:15. So he had told Felix a quarter past seven; by gum, he was hanging on to one rule at least, and he would certainly hang on to another one, no business talk at the table. He got up and left the room to wash his hands. By the time he got back Pierre had the mussels served and was waiting to hold his chair. He sat, forked a mussel to his mouth, used his tongue and teeth on it, swallowed, nodded, and said, "Mr. Hewitt has bloomed four crosses between "Miltonia sanderae" and "Odontoglossum pyramus". One of them is worth naming."
So they had found time to visit the orchid house.
Around half past eight Felix came and asked if he could have a minute to discuss the problem of shipping "langoustes" from France by air. It developed that what he really wanted was Wolfe's approval of frozen "langoustes", and of course he didn't get it. But he was stubborn, and they were still at it when Pierre ushered Sarah Dacos in. She was right on time. As I took her coat she accepted my offer of coffee, so I put her in a chair at the table and waited until Felix had gone to tell Wolfe her name.

"It didn't progress to intimacy."

"After you entered your apartment, before you heard footsteps on the stairs, did you hear any sound above you, in Mr. Althaus's apartment?"
"I didn't notice any. I was moving around, taking my coat off and putting it

 away, and the water was running, getting it cold enough to drink. And his room had a thick carpet."
"You had been in it?"
==> She nodded. "A few times. Three or four times. For a drink before we went to dinner." She picked up her cup, and her hand was steady. I said her coffee was cold and offered to pour her some hot, but she said it was all right and drank. Wolfe poured himself some and took a sip. <==
"When and how," he asked her, "did you learn that Mr. Althaus had been killed?"
"In the morning. I don't work on Saturday and I sleep late. Irene, the cleaning woman, came and banged on my door. It was after nine o'clock."
"Then it was you who phoned the police?"
"Yes."
"Did you tell them of seeing the three men leave the house?"

"Why did you think they were FBI men?"
"They "looked" like it. They looked young, and - well, sort of athletic, and the way they walked."
"You said there were no peculiarities."
"I know I did. It wasn't - I wouldn't call it "peculiarities"." She bit her lip. "I

==>  knew you would ask me this. I think I ought to admit - I think the main reason I told her that was because I knew how she felt about the FBI, I had heard her talking about that book, and I thought she would like - I mean, that would agree with how she felt about them. I don't like to admit this, Mr. Wolfe, of course I don't. I know how it sounds. I hope you won't tell Mrs. Bruner." <==
"I'll tell her only if it suits a purpose." Wolfe picked up his cup, drank, put the cup down, and looked at me. "Archie?"
"Maybe one or two little points." I looked at her, and she looked back. The hazel eyes seemed darker when they were straight at you. "Of course," I said, "the cops have asked you about the last time you spoke with Althaus. When was it?"
"Three days before - before that Friday. Tuesday morning, in the hall, just a minute or two. Just by accident."
"Did he tell you he was doing a piece on the FBI?"
"No. He never talked to me about his work."

"No."
"Did Althaus ever mention any of those names?"


"Not that I remember. He might have "mentioned" them."
==> I raised my brows at Wolfe. He regarded her for half a minute, grunted, and told her he doubted if she had supplied anything that would help, so the evening had probably been wasted. As he spoke I went and got her coat, and held it for her when she got up. Wolfe didn't leave his chair. He does sometimes rise when a woman comes or goes; he probably has some kind of a rule for it, but I have never been able to figure it out. She said I needn't bother to see her downstairs, but, wishing to show her that some private detectives have some manners, I went along. Down on the sidewalk, as the doorman waved a taxi up, she put her hand on my arm and said she would be "so" grateful if we didn't tell Mrs. Bruner, and I patted her shoulder. Patting a shoulder can be anything from an apology to a promise, and only the patter can say which. <==
When I got back to the room upstairs Wolfe was still in the armchair, with his fingers clasped at the peak of his middle mound. When I turned from shutting the door he growled, "Does she lie?"
I said certainly and went and sat. "How the devil can you tell?"
"All right," I said, "to skip argument I'll concede that I am wise to attractive young women and you are not, since that's your line. But even you must know that she is not a big enough sap to give Mrs. Bruner that guff about FBI men just because she thought she would like to hear it. I doubt if she's a sap at all. But she did tell Mrs. Bruner that, so she had a reason, and not just some bull about how they walked. She had a real reason, God knows what. One guess out of a dozen: When she went in the house she heard noises, and went up another flight and listened at Althaus's door, and heard something they said. I don't like it, because if it was something like that why didn't she tell the cops? I prefer something she wouldn't want to spill. For instance, she knew Althaus was working on the FBI. He had - "
"How did she know?"

"The hell we haven't. We have someone who had some reason for thinking they were G-men and is saving it. That will be pie for Cramer."
"No. It's our pie. We'll give Mr. Cramer Miss Dacos only when we have her ourselves, if at all." He pushed his chair back. "Get it out of her. Tomorrow. I'm tired. We're going home and to bed."

At 10:35 Saturday morning I used a key on the door of 63 Arbor Street, ascended two flights of wooden stairs, used another key, and entered the apartment that had been Morris Althaus's.
I was following my own approach to the problem of getting it out of Sarah Dacos. I admit it was roundabout, especially in view of the fact that time was short, but it was a better stab at getting results than persuading her to go to the Flamingo for an evening of dancing. The fact that time was short had been made publicly evident by an item on the twenty-eighth page of the morning paper, which I had read at my breakfast table in the kitchen. It was headlined FINGERS CROSSED? and said:
==> The members of the Ten for Aristology, one of the most exclusive of New York's gourmet groups, evidently do not believe that history repeats itself. Lewis Hewitt, capitalist, socialite, orchid fancier, and aristologist, will entertain the group at dinner at his home at North Cove, Long Island, on Thursday evening, January 14. The menu will be chosen by Nero Wolfe, the well-known private investigator, and the food will be prepared by Fritz Brermer, Mr. Wolfe's chef. Mr. Wolfe and Archie Goodwin, his confidential assistant, will be present as guests. <==
That arrangement arouses memory of another occasion when Mr. Brenner cooked a dinner for the Ten for Aristology, and Mr. Wolfe and Mr. Goodwin were guests, at the home of Benjamin Schriver, the shipping magnate. It occurred on April 1, 1958, and one of the Ten, Vincent Pyle, head of a Wall Street brokerage firm, was poisoned with arsenic in his portion of the first course, served to him by Carol Annis, who was subsequently convicted of first- degree murder.


Yesterday a "Times" reporter, remembering that former occasion, telephoned Mr. Hewitt and asked him if any of the Ten for Aristology (aristology means science of dining) had shown any reluctance to attend the affair next Thursday, and Mr. Hewitt said no. When the reporter asked him if he would keep his fingers crossed he said, "How can I? I couldn't handle my knife and fork."
It will certainly be an excellent meal.

Setting the date definitely, Thursday the fourteenth, was the detail I had been hottest about when discussing it with Wolfe Thursday night. I said it should be left open, that the item in the paper could say something like "some evening this month." Wolfe said that Hewitt, when phoning his fellow aristologists, would have to name a date. I said he could tell them it would have to be indefinite because it would depend on when Fritz could get something shipped by air from France. Gourmets love things shipped by air from France. But Wolfe had insisted, and now we were stuck with it, only five days to go.

So I hadn't liked the roundabout approach to Sarah Dacos, but it was obviously the best bet, and right after breakfast I had phoned Mrs. Althaus to ask if she could give me ten minutes. She had said yes, and I had gone, of course ignoring the tail problem. The more they saw me working the Althaus angle, the better. I told her there had been some developments which we would tell her about when we had figured them out, and it might help if she would let me take a look at everything that had been in her son's apartment, at least what was left of it. She said everything was left. The lease had nearly a year to go, and they hadn't tried to sublet. They hadn't removed anything, and as far as she knew the police hadn't either; they hadn't asked for permission to. I promised to take nothing without her permission if she would let me go and have a look, and she went and got the keys without phoning the lawyer or even her husband. Perhaps I appeal more to middle-aged women than to young ones, but don't try to tell Wolfe that.
So at 10:35 Saturday morning I entered the apartment of the late Morris Althaus, shut the door, and sent my eyes around. It wasn't bad at all if you ignored the pictures. As Sarah Dacos had said, the wall-to-wall carpet was thick. There was a big couch with a coffee table in front of it, a good sitting chair near a lamp, four other chairs, a small table with a metal object on it that might have been created by some kid handy with tools out of junk stuff he found in the garage, a large desk with nothing much on it besides a telephone, and a typewriter on a

 stand. Most of one wall had bookshelves, full, nearly to the ceiling. The less said about the pictures on the other walls the better. They would have been fine for a guessing game - have a party and everybody guesses what they are - if you could find someone who knew the answers.
I put my hat and coat on the couch and toured. Two closets in the living room. There was a bathroom, a small kitchen, and a bedroom with a single bed, a chest of drawers, a dresser, two chairs, and a closet full of clothes. On the dresser were framed photographs of his father and mother, so he hadn't resigned from the family, only from Peggy Pilgrim. I returned to the living room and started looking. With the tan drapes drawn it was dim, and I turned the lights on. The dust was thick on everything, but I was there legally and properly, so I didn't bother to put gloves on.

Of course I didn't expect to find anything obvious, pointing straight at anyone or anything in particular, since the cops had been through it, but they had had no one specffically in mind, and I did have: Sarah Dacos. No doubt you would like very much to have a complete inventory of everything in the place, especially the contents of the drawers and closets, but it would take too much space. I mention only one item, the 384 pages of the unfinished novel. I read a page and a half of it. To read it through to see if there was a girl in it who reminded me of Sarah Dacos would have taken all day.

Forever wilt thou love, and she be fair ***
I haven't read all the poetry in the world, but Lily Rowan has a shelf of it and on certain occasions wants me to read some aloud to her, and I was pretty sure I had read that, but there was something wrong with it. I tried to place it but couldn't. Anyway, the point was, who had written it? Not Althaus; I had seen his hand on various items. Sarah Dacos? If so, I had something. I had plenty. I put it on top of the chest and spent another hour looking, but drew a blank.
I had promised Mrs. Althaus I would take nothing without her permission, but I was tempted. I could take the photograph, not out of the house, but just one flight down, knock at Sarah Dacos's door, and if she was there, as she might be on a Saturday, display it and ask her, "Did you write that?" It was a real temptation, so quick and direct. But it was too damned direct. I would have to stick to the roundabout. I left the apartment and the house, found a phone booth, dialed Mrs. Bruner's number and got her, and told her I wanted to come and ask her something. She said she would be there until one o'clock. It was only twenty past twelve. I went out and got a taxi.
She was in her office, at her desk with some papers, expecting me. She asked if Miss Dacos had come as arranged, saying she had rather expected her to phone, but she hadn't. I said yes, she had come, and had been very cooperative. I emphasized the "very," since it was possible that the room was bugged. Then I sat, leaned forward to her, and whispered, "Do you mind if we whisper?"
She frowned. "It is so ridiculous!"
==> "Yes," I whispered, "but it's safe. You don't need to say much. I only want a sample of Miss Dacos's handwriting. Anything - a memo, a note to you. I know this seems even more ridiculous, but it isn't. Don't ask me to explain because I can't. I'm following instructions. Either you trust Mr. Wolfe to do the job and do it right or you don't." <==
"But why on earth - " she began, but I showed her a palm.
"If you don't want to whisper," I whispered, "just give me what I asked for and I'll go."
When I left the house five minutes later, with two samples of Sarah Dacos's hand

 in my pocket - a nine-word entry on a sheet from a desk calendar and a six-line memo to Mrs. Bruner - I was feeling that middle-aged women are the backbone of the country. She hadn't whispered a word. She had fished in a drawer and got the memo and torn the sheet from the calendar, handed them to me, said, a little louder than usual.

"As a matter of fact, he has, for one night. I won't explain that. Hold it a second." I transferred the receiver to my right hand and used the left to slip the photograph from my pocket. "Here's some poetry. Listen." I read it, with feeling. "Do you recognize it?"
"Certainly. So do you."
"No I don't, but it seems familiar." "It should. Where did you get it?" "I'll tell you someday. What is it?"
"It's a take-off of the last four lines of the second stanza of Keats's 'Ode on a Grecian Urn.' It's sort of clever, but no one should monkey with Keats. Escamillo, you're a pretty good detective and you dance like an angel, and you have other outstanding qualities, but you will never be a highbrow. Come and read Keats to me."
I told her she was too jejune, hung up, slipped the photograph back in my pocket, and went out and took my fifth taxi in five hours. The client could afford it.
==> It was five minutes to two when I put my hat and coat on the rack in the hall, went to the door of the dining room, told Wolfe, who was at the table, that it looked and felt like snow, and proceeded to the kitchen. I don't join Wolfe when <==

 I arrive in the middle of a meal; we agree that for one man to hurry with meat or fish while the other dawdles with pastry or cheese is bad for the atmosphere. Fritz put things on my breakfast table and brought what was left of the baked bluefish, and I asked him how he was getting on with the menu for next Thursday's blowout.
"I'm not discussing that," he said. "I am not discussing anything, Archie. He was in my room for more than an hour before lunch, talking with the television on loud. If it is so dangerous I will not talk at all."
I told him we should be back to normal by the time the shad roe started coming, and he threw up his hands and said good God in French.
When I finished and went to the office Wolfe was standing over by the globe, turning it and scowling at it. The man who gave him that globe, the biggest one I have ever seen, couldn't have known what a big help it would be. Whenever a situation gets so ticklish that he wishes he were somewhere else, he can walk over to the globe and pick spots to go to. Wonderful. As I entered he asked if I had anything, and when I nodded he went to his desk and I turned on the radio, took a yellow chair around near his elbow, and reported. It didn't take long, since there had been no conversation to speak of, just the action. I didn't mention the phone call to Lily Rowan because it had been purely personal. Having read the poetry twice, he handed the photograph back to me and said she had an ear for meter.

"I told you she wasn't a sap," I said. "Pretty neat, doing that with the last four lines of the second stanza of Keats's 'Ode on a Grecian Urn.'"
His eyes narrowed at me. "How the deuce do you know that? You don't read Keats."
I shrugged. "Back in Ohio in my boyhood days. As you know, I have quite a memory. I don't brag about that, but I have a brag coming about this." I tapped the photograph. "We know why she lied. She's involved. Possibly not too deep; it could be that she merely didn't want to admit she was close with him, close enough for him to tell her about the FBI. Or possibly "very" deep. 'Ever, ever shalt thou kiss.' And 'Forever wilt thou love.' But he told her he was going to marry another girl, so she shot him, probably with his own gun. The second alternative, which we prefer by far. It would be hard to nail her. She might be

 able to prove she was at that lecture but not what time she left. Possibly she wasn't there at all. She spent the evening at Sixty-three Arbor Street, having it out with the bold lover, and she shot him before the G-men arrived. Does that appeal to you?"

Yes."
"That's just dandy. Agencies are closed today and tomorrow, so Hewitt can't start looking until Monday. I'll be at the Flamingo this evening if anything happens; for instance, if Hewitt calls to say he has decided that it's too much trouble and we have to find someone else. Tomorrow Miss Rowan is having a crowd in for Sunday lunch and dancing and I'll stay afterwards to help empty ashtrays. Any instructions for this afternoon?"
"Turn off the radio," he growled.

==> It bothered me for four days and four nights, from Saturday afternoon, when Wolfe said we would forget the murder, to Wednesday morning, when I did something about it on my own. <==
There were two aspects. First, if the conjecture about Sarah Dacos, or something like it, was actually a fact, I had removed evidence from the scene of a murder and was withholding it. Of course the cops had had their whack at it, they had certainly seen the photograph and had left it there, and Mrs. Althaus had given me the keys, but that was only a legal out. It was the second aspect that really bothered me. Cramer had saved our licenses for us, at least so far, and it was me, Archie Goodwin, he had invited to a conference and bought a carton of milk for and turned loose on a homicide. I have no objection to playing games with cops, sometimes you want to and sometimes you have to, but this was different. I owed Cramer something personally.
So it bothered me, but something else was bothering me still more, the act Wolfe was staging, the fanciest on record. Too much of it, nearly all of it, was entirely out of our control. For instance, when I called Hewitt from a booth Monday evening to ask how he had made out, and he said fine, he had got one actor at one agency and the other at another, and they would both come to his place Tuesday afternoon, and I asked if he had made sure that the one for me could drive a car and had a license, he said he had forgotten to ask, but everyone could drive a car! And that was absolutely vital and he knew it. He said he would find out right away; he had the actor's phone number. On some other details he was okay, like his phone call to our number Tuesday noon, as arranged. He told Wolfe he was extremely sorry, he apologized, but he would be able to include only twelve "Phalaenopsis Aphrodite" in the shipment instead of twenty, and no

 "Oncidium flexuosum" at all. He said he would do his best to get it off by noon Wednesday, so it should arrive by two o'clock. He handled that perfectly. He was also okay on the call he made Tuesday evening, to report on the supplies and arrangements for the dinner for the Ten for Aristology, but for him that was just routine, and anyway it was straight.
Fred Durkin and Orrie Cather were no worry because they had been left to Saul to handle, and if there was any snag he would let us know. How was up to him.

Off and on all day and evening Monday, and even some on Tuesday, Wolfe and I discussed a problem. It wasn't an argument; we just discussed it. Should I phone Wragg, the special agent in charge, arrange to meet him somewhere, tell him that Wolfe had got enough dope on the Althaus homicide to make it really tough and I wanted out, and offer to pass everything we had over to him for ten grand or twenty grand or fifty grand? The trouble was we didn't know him. It might make it next to certain that he would take the bait, but it might do just the opposite, make him smell a rat. Finally, late Tuesday morning, we crossed it off. It was too chancy, and time was too short.
At nine o'clock Wednesday morning, when I heard the elevator taking Wolfe up to the plant rooms, I took my second cup of breakfast coffee to the office, to sit and look at an idea that had been pecking at me off and on since Monday morning. There would be nothing for me until the truckload of orchids arrived at two o'clock; everything had been done that could be done as far as I knew, which wasn't very far. When I finished the coffee it was only nine-twenty, and Sarah Dacos probably didn't start the day at the Bruner office until nine-thirty or even ten. I went to the cabinet, unlocked the drawer where we keep assortments of keys, and made some selections. It wasn't complicated, since I knew the lock was a Bermatt. From another drawer I got a pair of rubber gloves.

I came mighty close to passing it by. The bedroom closet was crammed - clothes on hangers, shoe racks, luggage, cartons and hatboxes on two high shelves. The bag and two suitcases were packed with summer clothes, and I skipped the hatboxes; I would have given a finif of "my" money to know if the cleaning woman came Wednesdays. But ten minutes later, going through a drawerful of photographs one by one, I realized that it was dumb to skip the hatboxes and then waste time with a bunch of photographs which could tell me nothing I didn't already know, so I took a chair to the closet, mounted it, and got the boxes down. There were three. The first one contained three so-called hats and two bikinis. The second one held one big floppy hat. I lifted it out, and there on the bottom was a revolver. I gawked at it for five seconds, then took it out and inspected it.

 It was an S &amp; W.38 and held one cartridge that had been fired and five that hadn't.
I stood with it in my hand. It was a hundred to one that it was the gun that Althaus had had a permit for, and it had fired the bullet that had gone through him, and Sarah Dacos had pulled the trigger. To hell with the one chance in a hundred. The question was what to do with it. If I took it, it would never be an acceptable exhibit in a murder trial, since I had got it illegally. If I left it there and went out to a phone booth and rang Cramer to tell him to get a warrant to search Sarah Dacos's apartment, the cops would get the gun all right, but if the FBI found out about it within thirty-six hours, as they easily might, the big act for Thursday night would be kaput. And of course if I left it in the hatbox and "didn't" phone Cramer, Sarah Dacos might decide that tonight would be a good time to take it and toss it in the river.
Since that left only one alternative, the only decision that had to be made was where to put it. I returned the hat to the box and the boxes to the shelf, put the chair back where it belonged, and looked around. No spot in the bedroom appealed to me, and I moved to the living room. It was now more than ever desirable not to be interrupted by a cleaning woman or anyone else. I went and examined the couch and found that underneath the cushion was a box spring, and underneath the spring was a plywood bottom. Good enough. If she got the hatbox down and found the gun gone, she certainly wouldn't suppose it had merely been moved to another spot in the apartment and start looking. I put it on the bottom under the spring, glanced around to see that things were as I had found them, grabbed my hat and coat, and got out of there in such a hurry that I almost appeared on the sidewalk wearing rubber gloves.
==> In the taxi I had to answer another question: did I or didn't I tell Wolfe? Why not wait until Thursday night had come and gone? The answer was really simple, but of course that's one thing we use our minds for, finding complicated reasons for dodging simple answers. By the time the cab stopped in front of the old brownstone my mind had run out of reasons and I was facing the fact that it wouldn't improve with age. <==
It was ten minutes past eleven, so Wolfe would be down from the plant rooms, but he wasn't in the office. There was noise in the kitchen, the radio going loud, and I went there. Wolfe was standing by the big table scowling at Fritz, who was bending over to sniff at a slab of smoked sturgeon. They didn't hear me enter, but Fritz saw me when he straightened up, and Wolfe turned and demanded,

 "Where have you been?"
I told him I had a report. He told Fritz to have the cutlets ready at a quarter past two, he wasn't going to wait longer than that, and headed for the office, and I followed. I turned the radio on. As I brought a yellow chair around I saw three screwdrivers on his desk pad - one from my desk drawer and two from the kitchen, and I had to grin. He had the tools ready, himself. As I sat I told him I had assumed that he would eat an early lunch. He said no, if a man has guests he should be at table with them.
"Then there's plenty of time," I said, "to discuss a brief report. With so much on your mind I could save it, but you'll like to know that I have clinched the alternative we prefer. I went for a walk and happened to pass Sixty-three Arbor Street, and I happened to have a key in my pocket that fitted the lock on Sarah Dacos's door, so I went in and looked around, and in a hatbox in a closet I found a revolver, an S and W thirty-eight. One cartridge had been fired. As you know, Cramer told me that Althaus had a permit for an S and W thirty-eight and it wasn't in his apartment, though there was a box of cartridges in a drawer. So she -"

 Even if she stays put I'll have a problem, if tomorrow night is a turkey. If and if. Just now I wanted to ring Hewitt from a booth and ask him if the orchids are packed. Shall I?"
"No. He's busy. I believe guns can be identified?"
"Sure. Scientists can do it now even if the number has been filed off. And Cramer will have the number of the one Althaus had a permit for."
"Then there will be no problem. I must see about that sturgeon." He left his chair and headed for the door. Short of it he stopped and turned, said, "Satisfactory," and went. I shook my head and went on shaking it as I replaced the yellow chair. "There will be no problem," for God's sake. I thought if I had an ego that size I'd be the boss of the FBI, and then realized that that wasn't exactly the way to put it. I returned the keys and gloves to the cabinet, went to the kitchen to get a glass of milk, since lunch would be late, and to listen to them discuss sturgeon.
==> With a couple of hours to go, possibly more, after the milk was down I made the rounds - first two flights up to my room, to see that everything was in order for the guests who would occupy my bed. Fritz isn't supposed to touch my room; it's mine, including the responsibility. It was okay, except that the two pillows I had got from the closet that morning weren't the same size, but that couldn't be helped. Then to the South Room, which is above Wolfe's, where two more guests would sleep on the twin beds. That visit was unnecessary, since Fritz never makes mistakes, but I had time to kill. <==
It got killed somehow.
I wasn't expecting them until two at the earliest, but I should have known better, since Saul was in charge. Wolfe was in the kitchen and I was in the front room, which adjoins the office, checking that blankets were on the sofa, when the doorbell rang and I glanced at my watch. Twenty to two, so it couldn't be the truck.
But it was. Going to the hall, I saw a big bozo in a leather jacket on the stoop. When I opened the door he boomed at me, "Nero Wolfe? Orchids for you!"
I stepped out. At the curb was a big green truck with red lettering on its side: NORTH SHORE TRUCKING CORPORATION. Another big bozo was at its rear, opening the doors. I said fairly loud that it was pretty damn cold for orchids and I would come and help. By the time I got my coat on and went out they had

I shook my head and went on shaking it as I replaced the yellow chair. "There will be no problem," for God's sake. I thought if I had an ego that size I'd be the boss of the FBI, and then realized that that wasn't exactly the way to put it. I returned the keys and gloves to the cabinet, went to the kitchen to get a glass of milk, since lunch would be late, and to listen to them discuss sturgeon.
With a couple of hours to go, possibly more, after the milk was down I made the rounds - first two flights up to my room, to see that everything was in order for the guests who would occupy my bed. Fritz isn't supposed to touch my room; it's mine, including the responsibility. It was okay, except that the two pillows I had got from the closet that morning weren't the same size, but that couldn't be helped. Then to the South Room, which is above Wolfe's, where two more guests would sleep on the twin beds. That visit was unnecessary, since Fritz never makes mistakes, but I had time to kill.
It got killed somehow.
==> I wasn't expecting them until two at the earliest, but I should have known better, since Saul was in charge. Wolfe was in the kitchen and I was in the front room, which adjoins the office, checking that blankets were on the sofa, when the doorbell rang and I glanced at my watch. Twenty to two, so it couldn't be the truck. <==
But it was. Going to the hall, I saw a big bozo in a leather jacket on the stoop. When I opened the door he boomed at me, "Nero Wolfe? Orchids for you!"
I stepped out. At the curb was a big green truck with red lettering on its side: NORTH SHORE TRUCKING CORPORATION. Another big bozo was at its rear, opening the doors. I said fairly loud that it was pretty damn cold for orchids and I would come and help. By the time I got my coat on and went out they had

 a box on the edge at the back and were pulling it around. I happened to know its exact size - three feet wide, five feet long, and two feet high - because I had packed boxes exactly like it with orchid plants on their way to dealers or exhibitions. On its side it was marked:

==> I descended to the sidewalk, but they lifted it off and got the handles at the ends, obviously not needing any help, even up the steps. Above, Wolfe had the door open and they entered. The natural thing for me was to stay and guard the truck, so I did. There were five more boxes inside, all the same. One of the five would be quite a load even for those two huskies, but I didn't know which one. It proved to be the next to the last. As they eased it down and took the handles one of them said, "Jesus, these must be in lead pots," and the other one said, "Naw, gold." I wondered if there was a G-man close enough to hear. They got it up the stoop without a stumble, though it was close to three hundred pounds, counting the box - or I hoped it was. When they took the last one in I went along. Wolfe signed a receipt, and I gave each of them two bucks and got thanked and waited until they were on the sidewalk to shut the door and bolt it. <==
The boxes were strung along the hall, the radio in the office was on loud, and Wolfe was using a screwdriver on the third box from the end. I asked him if he was sure, and when he said yes, an X was chalked on it, I got another screwdriver. There were only eight screws, and in a couple of minutes we had them out. I lifted the top off, and there was Saul Panzer, on his side with his knees pulled up. I started to tilt the box, but Saul, who is undersized except for his ears and nose, twisted around and was on his knees and then his feet.
"Good afternoon," Wolfe said.
"Not very." Saul stretched. "I can talk?"
"Yes, with the radio."
He stretched again. "That was a ride. I hope they're alive."

"Ashley Jarvis. That's you. Dale Kirby is Archie. We'd better get them out." That was the first and only time I have ever heard men introduced while boxed.

In a moment," Wolfe said. "You have given them a full explanation?"
"Yes, sir. They are not to speak, not a word, unless you ask them to - or Archie. They don't know who has bugged the house and is watching it, or why, but they have bought Hewitt's promise that they are in no danger and won't be. He gave them five hundred dollars apiece and you are to give them another five hundred. He also gave them the statements signed by you. I think they'll do." He lowered his voice a little. "Kirby is better than Jarvis, but they'll do."

==> Wolfe made a face. "Very well. Fred and Orrie first." <==
"They're marked." He took the screwdriver from Wolfe, went to the box with a circle chalked on it, told me, "Orrie's has a triangle," and started on a screw. I found the triangle and started on it. He had Fred out before I got Orrie because one of the screws had a bad head. They too had been told not to speak unless spoken to, and from the expressions on their faces when they got upright I thought it was just as well. I raised my brows at Saul and tapped my chest, and he pointed to the box at the far end, and I went and started on it.
I realize that professional actors have had a lot of practice saying only what they are supposed to say and keeping their traps closed if that's what the script calls for, but even so I had to hand it to Ashley Jarvis and Dale Kirby. They had had a rough two hours or more - especially Jarvis, who carried fully as many pounds as Wolfe, and it wasn't quite as well distributed. We had to ease the box over on its side before he could come loose, and he stayed on the floor a good five minutes, refusing offers of help, working his arms and legs, but when he finally made it and was erect he turned to Wolfe and bowed, a damn good bow. Kirby hadn't bowed to me, but he hadn't said a word. While we waited for Jarvis to get up he stood to one side doing calisthenics, keeping time with the music on the radio.

was agreeing with Saul, they'll do. Kirby was half an inch shorter than me, but his build was just right. Jarvis was exactly Wolfe's height. His shoulders weren't quite as broad and his middle was a little farther around, but with an overcoat on he would do fine. The faces were only so-so, but it would be dark and no C-man was going to get a close-up.
Wolfe returned the bow with a nod, said, "Come, gentlemen," and entered the office. Instead of going to his desk, he moved a yellow chair to the center of the rug, which was thick enough to prevent noise, and went for another one. I got a couple, and Saul and Fred and Orrie each got one, and we all sat, in two circles, with Wolfe and Jarvis and Kirby on the inside. But Wolfe said, "The money, Archie," and I got up and went to the safe for it - two wads with twenty-five twenties in each which were there waiting.

During that period there must be no single sound which, if overheard, would disclose your presence in this house. Your room is two flights up. You will use the stairs, not the elevator.

"They're marked." He took the screwdriver from Wolfe, went to the box with a circle chalked on it, told me, "Orrie's has a triangle," and started on a screw. I found the triangle and started on it. He had Fred out before I got Orrie because one of the screws had a bad head. They too had been told not to speak unless spoken to, and from the expressions on their faces when they got upright I thought it was just as well. I raised my brows at Saul and tapped my chest, and he pointed to the box at the far end, and I went and started on it.
I realize that professional actors have had a lot of practice saying only what they are supposed to say and keeping their traps closed if that's what the script calls for, but even so I had to hand it to Ashley Jarvis and Dale Kirby. They had had a rough two hours or more - especially Jarvis, who carried fully as many pounds as Wolfe, and it wasn't quite as well distributed. We had to ease the box over on its side before he could come loose, and he stayed on the floor a good five minutes, refusing offers of help, working his arms and legs, but when he finally made it and was erect he turned to Wolfe and bowed, a damn good bow. Kirby hadn't bowed to me, but he hadn't said a word. While we waited for Jarvis to get up he stood to one side doing calisthenics, keeping time with the music on the radio.

was agreeing with Saul, they'll do. Kirby was half an inch shorter than me, but his build was just right. Jarvis was exactly Wolfe's height. His shoulders weren't quite as broad and his middle was a little farther around, but with an overcoat on he would do fine. The faces were only so-so, but it would be dark and no C-man was going to get a close-up.
Wolfe returned the bow with a nod, said, "Come, gentlemen," and entered the office. Instead of going to his desk, he moved a yellow chair to the center of the rug, which was thick enough to prevent noise, and went for another one. I got a couple, and Saul and Fred and Orrie each got one, and we all sat, in two circles, with Wolfe and Jarvis and Kirby on the inside. But Wolfe said, "The money, Archie," and I got up and went to the safe for it - two wads with twenty-five twenties in each which were there waiting.
==> Wolfe's eyes went from Jarvis to Kirby and back. "Lunch is ready," he said, "but first a few points. That money is yours. Archie?" <==
I handed it to them, a wad to each. Jarvis merely glanced at it and stuck it in his side pocket. Kirby got a wallet from his breast pocket, put the bills in nice and neat, and replaced the wallet.
"Mr. Hewitt explained," Wolfe said, "that you would each receive one thousand dollars, and now you have. But having seen you emerge from those boxes, I feel that you have already earned the thousand. Amply. Therefore, if you perform the rest of it satisfactorily, I shall feel that you have earned another thousand, and you will receive it. Friday or Saturday."
Jarvis opened his mouth, remembered just in time, and shut it. He pointed to Kirby, tapped his own chest, and looked a question.
Wolfe nodded. "Two thousand. One to each of you. A little closer, Mr. Kirby. I must keep my voice down. You gentlemen will be here twenty-eight hours. During that period there must be no single sound which, if overheard, would disclose your presence in this house. Your room is two flights up. You will use the stairs, not the elevator. If you need something there will be a man in the hall outside. If you must communicate you will whisper. There are several dozen books in your room. If none of them is to your taste you may select one from these shelves. No radio or television; the house must not be a hubbub.

 pursed his lips. "I think that covers it. If you have questions, ask them now, in an undertone near my ear. Have you?"
They shook their heads.

I wouldn't want to go through that twenty-eight hours again.
Going through a forest where you know there are snipers and one might be up any tree takes only guts and sharp eyes. But if you don't "know" there are snipers but only that there could be, that's different. Why all the guts and the keen and careful eyes? We didn't know the house was bugged, only that it might be. If Jarvis or Kirby caught a finger in the bathroom door and yelled ouch or goddammit, it might wreck the act, but only "might", and that was the hell of it. Every time I made a trip upstairs to check that Saul or Fred or Orrie was there in the hall, and that they hadn't got fed up and started talking, I felt foolish. Grown men don't look under the bed every night to see if there's a burglar, though there "might" be one.
==> The two meals were screwy, with Wolfe and me, mostly Wolfe, carrying on with table talk, while the other five just ate and listened. Try it sometime. I couldn't even ask one of them to pass the butter; I could just point. And when we were doing something, for instance taking the boxes up to the potting room and stacking them, even I couldn't talk, because whom would I be talking to? <==
I left the house only once, late Wednesday afternoon, to call Hewitt from a booth and tell him the shipment had arrived in good condition, and to the garage to give Tom Halloran the picture.
There were bright spots, two of them on Wednesday and four on Thursday, when Jarvis observed Wolfe. Jarvis would stand at the foot of the stairs and study Wolfe coming down, at the top and study him going down, and in the hall and study him on the level. By the second session Thursday I knew Jarvis was pulling Wolfe's leg, enjoying the look on his face, but I was enjoying it too. Of

 course Kirby observed me the same way, but that was no hardship; on a normal day I go up and down those stairs a dozen times or more. What Kirby couldn't observe was my driving. They would probably be tailed all the way to Hewitt's, and if his style at the wheel was too different from mine it could make a smart G-man suspicious. Thursday morning I took him to the office and turned on the radio and discussed it for half an hour.
Looking back at it, I don't think we missed a single bet. Around eleven o'clock Wednesday night I went up to my room, which fronts on Thirty-fifth Street, paid no more attention to the curtains than usual, changed to pajamas, sat on the bed, and turned out the light on the bed stand. In a couple of minutes Fred and Orrie entered and undressed in the dark, and I got out and they got in. Saul slept on the sofa in the front room, and we didn't turn the lights on in there at all. We rarely do.

I mention a funny thing. As I turned the office lights out Wednesday night and got between sheets on the couch, I was thinking not of the trap we were setting and whether it was going to work, but of the couch in Sarah Dacos's apartment. What if the cleaning woman decided to turn the cushion over and looked under the spring? If I had stayed another five minutes maybe I could have found a better spot.
The two meals I mentioned were Wednesday's lunch and dinner. Thursday's breakfast and lunch were different because Fritz wasn't there. The arrangement was that Hewitt would have a car there for Fritz at eight o'clock, and it came right on time. I carried his bag out for him, and at the car door he shook my hand, looking glum. He was in no mood for producing masterpieces for a bunch of aristologists. Saul and I handled the breakfast problem, and for lunch we had cold cuts, including the sturgeon, which had been passed as edible, two bottles of champague, and five kinds of cheese.

==> At 4:45 Thursday afternoon I was in the office with Saul and Fred and Orrie when Theodore Horstmann, the orchid nurse, who had been told to leave early, came downstairs, said good night, and left. Wolfe was up in his room. At 5:10 I went up to my room, turned on the lights, and started changing. I could have made sure that there was no chink in the curtains and just sat, but it wouldn't have been normal for me to bother about chinks and we damned well wanted everything normal. Wolfe, in his room, was doing likewise. At 5:40, dressed for dinner, I went back down to the office, and at 5:45 there was the sound of the elevator, and Wolfe appeared, also dressed. He and I started talking, no radio, <==

 about traffic problems. At 5:55 on the dot there was a faint sound of footsteps in the hall, and Jarvis and Kirby were there. Jarvis's dinner uniform was a big improvement on Wolfe's, which had seen better years, but Kirby's wasn't up to mine, which had set me back three Cs. They stood at the door. I told Wolfe I would wait in the car, went to the hall, held my coat for Kirby and handed him my hat, and stayed in the corner out of range as he opened the door, crossed the sill, and pulled the door shut. As Jarvis came and stood looking out through the one-way glass, with me at his elbow, the lights in the office went out, and I got Wolfe's coat and hat for Jarvis. In about half an hour which was really about six minutes the Heron showed and came to a stop at the curb. Jarvis flipped the light switch and the hall was dark, but I moved out of range until he was out and the door closed. I watched him and decided he was earning the extra grand. I had had no opinion about Kirby, since I don't know how I look when I walk, but I would have sworn it was Wolfe going down the steps, crossing the sidewalk, and getting into the car, if I hadn't known. The Heron rolled away, smooth, no jerks, like me, and I realized I had been holding my breath God knows how long.
The office was now empty if they had followed the script. Before the lights went out in the hall Wolfe had gone to the dark kitchen, Orrie to the dark dining room, and Saul and Fred through the connecting door to the dark front room. I hadn't heard them, so no one had. I put my hand in my side pocket to touch the Marley.38, stepped to the door and touched the edge to make sure it was closed, stood until my eyes were as well adjusted to the dark as they would get, and sat down on the chair at the wall opposite the rack.
I felt fine. The strain was over. It could have been spoiled a hundred different ways, by either bad handling or bad luck, but here we were, all set, with nothing to do but wait. Either they had decided to do a bag job or they hadn't, and that was their strain, not mine. I didn't know what their score was on bag jobs, no outsider does, but I knew of four in New York the past year, definitely, and I had heard talk of several more. It depended on whether Wragg believed that a G-man had killed Althaus. If he did, ten to one they would come. If he didn't, if he had somehow been satisfied that his men were clean on the murder, they wouldn't come. Whether the bait was good enough depended on him, not on us. I felt fine.
When I decided half an hour had passed I went to the door to look at my watch by the light coming through the one-way glass, and when I saw 6:22 I felt a little less fine. Wrong by eight minutes. I am supposed to be good at judging time, so evidently I wasn't as unstrained as I thought I was. Instead of sitting, I walked

 down the hall to the office door and felt still less fine when I rubbed against the wall twice. That was inexcusable. Of course going back to the front, toward the rectangle of light, was simple, but damn it, I should be able to go straight down the center of the hall I knew so well into the pitch dark. I did, three times, and then went to the chair and sat.

I didn't know what their score was on bag jobs, no outsider does, but I knew of four in New York the past year, definitely, and I had heard talk of several more. It depended on whether Wragg believed that a G-man had killed Althaus. If he did, ten to one they would come. If he didn't, if he had somehow been satisfied that his men were clean on the murder, they wouldn't come. Whether the bait was good enough depended on him, not on us. I felt fine.
When I decided half an hour had passed I went to the door to look at my watch by the light coming through the one-way glass, and when I saw 6:22 I felt a little less fine. Wrong by eight minutes. I am supposed to be good at judging time, so evidently I wasn't as unstrained as I thought I was. Instead of sitting, I walked

 down the hall to the office door and felt still less fine when I rubbed against the wall twice. That was inexcusable. Of course going back to the front, toward the rectangle of light, was simple, but damn it, I should be able to go straight down the center of the hall I knew so well into the pitch dark. I did, three times, and then went to the chair and sat.
I can't give the precise time that they came because I was determined not to look again until seven o'clock, but it was close to seven. Suddenly the dim light at the door was even dimmer and there they were. Two of them. A third was probably down on the sidewalk. One of them bent over to look at the lock, and the other stood at the top of the first step, his back to the door, facing the street.

I have since argued with Saul about how long it took him. He says the door opened eight minutes after I hissed, and I say ten. Anyway it opened, and as it started I moved into the office, got my back against the wall to the left of the door, put my left hand behind me with a finger on the light switch, and took the Marley from my pocket with the right.
Once in, they didn't listen more than five seconds, which was bad technique. They came straight down the hall. With my head turned, I saw the faint gleam of a pencil-flash grow brighter, then streak into the office, and then them. They came in three or four steps and stopped. The one with the flash started it around and in three seconds it would have hit me, so I sang out, "Play ball!" raised the Marley, and flipped the switch, and there was light.
One of them just gawked, but the one with the flash dropped it and started his hand inside his jacket. But not only did I have my gun out, Orrie was there beside me with his, and Saul's voice came from the door of the front room, "Strike one!" They turned their heads and saw two more guns.
"It looks bad," I said. "We don't even need to frisk you, you can't shoot in two

==>  directions at once. Mr. Wolfe!" <==
He was there. He must have left the kitchen when I called, "Play ball." I said, "Go around," but he had already started that way, to the right of the red leather chair, well out of their reach. At his desk he sat and eyed them - their profiles, since they were facing Orrie and me.
He spoke. "This is deplorable. Archie, call the police." I moved. I didn't make as wide a detour as Wolfe had, but the program would go better without a scuffle, so I circled around. Halfway to my desk I stopped and said, "Look. If you jump me when I'm dialing you won't leave here on your feet. I suppose you know the law, crashers do. You're inside. If you try getting rough they'll plug you and all they'll get from the law is thanks."
"Balls." It was the big handsome one with a square jaw and square shoulders. The other one was taller, but skinny, with a face that showed the bones. Handsome was giving me the stony stare. "We're not crashers, and you know it."
"Like hell I do. You crashed. You can explain it to the cops. I've warned you. Stay put. Start moving and you'll get stopped. One of them has a quick finger."
To get to the phone at my desk I had to give them my back. I did, and as I reached for the phone he snapped, "Cut the comedy, Goodwin. You know damn well what we are." He turned to Wolfe. "We're agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and you know it. We have touched nothing, and we didn't intend to. We wanted to see you. When we rang there was no answer, and the door wasn't locked, and we came in."

When you are searched, by the police, your tools will be found. Federal Bureau of Investigation? Pfui. Get the police, Archie, and tell them to send men capable of handling a pair of ruffians."
Before I turned to dial I said, "Fred," and bent a finger at him, and he came. Passing them, he barely gave them elbow room. He had once had an arm twisted by a G-man, and he would have welcomed a chance to even up. With the backs of his thighs against Wolfe's desk, facing them, his gun at his hip, he looked much nastier than he actually is. He is really a nice guy, with a wife and four children. As I started dialing I would have given a hundred to one that I wouldn't

 finish, and I didn't. At the fourth whirl Handsome blurted, "Hold it, Goodwin," and I stopped my finger and turned. He was slipping his left hand inside his coat. I cradled the phone and moved beside Fred. The G-man's hand came out with his little black leather fold. "Credentials," he said, and opened it and displayed it.
That was the ticklish spot. They're supposed to show it but hang on to it. Wolfe growled, "I'll inspect it," and Handsome made a move forward, and Fred's big left hand shot out and shoved him back. I put a hand out, palm up, but said nothing. He hesitated, not long, and put it on my palm. I said, "You too," to Skinny and stretched my arm. He had his fold already out and put it on top of the other one, and I turned and handed them to Wolfe. He looked at one and then the other, opened a drawer and got his big glass, inspected them through the glass, taking his time, returned the glass to the drawer, dropped the folds in on top of it, shut the drawer, and regarded them.

It must have taken a lot of control for them to hold tight. I would have admired them if my mind hadn't been occupied. They both went stiff but they didn't move; then Skinny said, "You fat sonofabitch."

He cleared his throat. "Now. Still on the assumption. I am going to keep your credentials as hostages.

If you are armed we should take your weapons and also the tools you brought to open my door - and, no doubt, to open doors and drawers in this office. And the gloves you're wearing. I advise you to leave without delay. These four men are not fond either of burglars or of the FBI, and they would enjoy humiliating you. Confound it, go!" <==
They stood and looked at him. Handsome's line of vision was between Fred's shoulder and mine, and Skinny's was to the right of Fred. They exchanged glances, looked at Wolfe again, and moved. As they approached the door Orrie backed into the hall, his gun on them. He likes to point a gun. Saul went through the front room to the hall and turned the light on. Fred and I followed the G-men. When they neared the front door Saul opened it, and Orrie and Fred and I joined him to watch them descend to the sidewalk. Almost certainly there had been a third one, but he was nowhere in sight. They turned left, toward Tenth Avenue, but we didn't go out to see them to their car. Before we closed the door we examined the lock and found it intact. As I slid the bolt in Fred said that they must have the finest key collection in the world.
When we filed back into the office Wolfe was standing in the center of the rug, inspecting an object in his hand - the pencil flash Handsome had dropped. He tossed it onto my desk and roared, "Talk! All of you! Talk!"
Everybody laughed.

"I'm offering a reward," I said, loud. "A framed photograph of J. Edgar Hoover to anyone who will prove that it "is" bugged and they have a tape of that to send him."

I advise you to leave without delay. These four men are not fond either of burglars or of the FBI, and they would enjoy humiliating you. Confound it, go!"
They stood and looked at him. Handsome's line of vision was between Fred's shoulder and mine, and Skinny's was to the right of Fred. They exchanged glances, looked at Wolfe again, and moved. As they approached the door Orrie backed into the hall, his gun on them. He likes to point a gun. Saul went through the front room to the hall and turned the light on. Fred and I followed the G-men. When they neared the front door Saul opened it, and Orrie and Fred and I joined him to watch them descend to the sidewalk. Almost certainly there had been a third one, but he was nowhere in sight. They turned left, toward Tenth Avenue, but we didn't go out to see them to their car. Before we closed the door we examined the lock and found it intact. As I slid the bolt in Fred said that they must have the finest key collection in the world.
==> When we filed back into the office Wolfe was standing in the center of the rug, inspecting an object in his hand - the pencil flash Handsome had dropped. He tossed it onto my desk and roared, "Talk! All of you! Talk!" <==
Everybody laughed.

"I'm offering a reward," I said, loud. "A framed photograph of J. Edgar Hoover to anyone who will prove that it "is" bugged and they have a tape of that to send him."
"By God," Fred said, "if only they had tried something." "I want champagne," Saul said.
"Make mine bourbon," Orrie said. "I'm hungry."

==> It was twenty minutes to eight. We went to the kitchen, including Wolfe, everybody talking at once. Wolfe began getting things from the refrigerator - caviar, "pate de foie gras", sturgeon, a whole smoked pheasant. Saul opened the freezer to get ice for champague. Orrie and I got bottles from the cupboard. Fred asked if he could use the phone to call his wife, and I said yes and give her my love, but Wolfe spoke. <==
"Tell her you will stay here tonight. You will all stay. In the morning Archie will take those things to the bank, and you'll go with him. They will probably do nothing, but they might try anything. Fred, tell nothing of this to your wife, or to anyone else. It isn't finished, it's only well started. If you men want something hot I can have Yorkshire Buck in twenty minutes if Archie will poach the eggs.
They all said no, which suited me fine. I hate to poach eggs.
An hour later we were having a pleasant evening. The three guests and I were in the front room, in a tight game of pinochle, and Wolfe was in his one and only chair in the office, reading a book. The book was "The FBI Nobody Knows". He was either gloating or doing research, I didn't know which.
At ten o'clock I had to excuse myself from the card table briefly; Wolfe had said he wanted to call Hewitt then, when the aristologists would presumably have finished their meal. I went to the office and made the call. Wolfe told Hewitt it had worked perfectly and thanked him. Hewitt said they had found the standins very entertaining; Jarvis had recited passages from Shakespeare and Kirby had mimicked President Johnson and Barry Goldwater and Alfred Lunt. Wolfe said to give them his regards, and I went back to pinochle and Wolfe to his book.
But there was another interruption a little after eleven o'clock. The phone rang, and Wolfe hates to answer it, so I went and got it at my desk.

"Nero Wolfe's residence, Archie Goodwin speaking."
"This is Richard Wragg, Goodwin." The voice was a drawl, smooth and low- pitched. "I want to speak to Wolfe."

"I'm sorry, Wragg, that isn't possible. He's very busy. The earliest would be eleven in the morning."
"What's he busy at?"
"He's reading a book. "The FBI Nobody Knows." In half an hour hell be in bed." "I'll be there at eleven."
==> It sounded as if he cradled it with a bang, but I could have imagined that. I turned to Wolfe. "I called him Wragg because that's his name. Eleven o'clock tomorrow morning. As expected." <==
"And desired. We must confer. When your game is finished."
I rose. "It won't take long. I just melded three hundred and forty."

I need, and nearly always get, a good eight hours' sleep, but that night I got six. At 1:10, with Wolfe gone up to bed, and also Fred and Orrie, and Saul on the sofa in the front room, I was about to crawl in on the couch when the doorbell rang. It was Fritz and Jarvis and Kirby, and when I saw Kirby stagger across the threshold I wondered what ditch the Heron was in. I asked him where the car was and he just goggled at me, his lips pressed tight. Thinking he was sticking to

 the instructions, I told him he could talk now, and Fritz said he could not talk now because he was too drunk, and added that the car was out in front, perfectly all right, but only the good God knew how it had got there. He took them up to their room in the elevator, and I put on shoes and my overcoat over pajamas, and went out and took the Heron to the garage. Not a scratch.
The first number on the program for Friday was scheduled for 8:30. At 7:45 I turned on the will power and rolled out, got my arms full of blankets and sheets and pillow, and made it up to my room. When I came out of the bathroom after showering and shaving, Fred and Orrie were sitting on the edge of the bed, yawning. I remarked that we would be leaving in an hour and twenty minutes and they told me to go soak my head, but I already had. I was expecting to have to manage my own breakfast, but as I was going downstairs Fritz emerged from Wolfe's room, having delivered the breakfast tray nearly on time. It was 8:28, and I went to the office and started the day by dialing Mrs. Bruner's number and got her. I told her I was sorry to disturb her so early in the day, but I had an important message, and would she please go out to a booth and ring me at a certain number, which I gave her, at 9:45 or as soon after as possible. She said it would interfere with an appointment and how important was it, and I said extremely, and she said all right.
So we could take our time at breakfast, and it was just as well. Fritz knows that Saul and Fred and Orrie all like eggs "au beurre noir", so that was the main item, with toast and bacon, and two rounds for each of us, two eggs to a round, added up to sixteen eggs. The expense account for that operation was going to be a lulu.
With the credentials in my pocket, I left the house with my bodyguard at 9:40, walked to the drugstore at the corner, and stationed myself near the booth. With my understanding of women, I was prepared to wait up to twenty minutes, but at 9:46 it rang, just as a man who had entered was heading for the booth. As I lifted the receiver I decided that he was not a G-man come to take the call; he didn't look the part.

"You couldn't possibly have any appointment half as important," I told her. "Forget appointments. You are to be at Mr. Wolfe's office at a quarter to eleven, not one second later."

"But why? What is it?"
"I'm just the messenger boy. You'll find out when you come. It's not just important, it's vital."

"Nothing." I hung up.
I didn't feel vital, with only six hours' sleep, but I felt important as I walked crosstown to the Continental Bank and Trust Company on Lexington Avenue with the winter wind at my back. Not many men have had such a bodyguard - the best operative between the two oceans plus two damned good ones. If you think we were overdoing it, what if I stumbled and cracked my skull, or what if I ran into a siren who dazzled me and she turned out to be a G-woman? Anyway, they were there in the house and a walk would do them good. At the bank I went downstairs first, to the safe-deposit box, and stashed the credentials. Upstairs, as I cashed a check for five grand to replenish the cash reserve in the safe, I was thinking that it had been just nine days, to the hour, since I had been there to deposit the retainer. I had thought then that there was one chance in a million. Now...
We had to step on it to get back to the old brownstone by a quarter to eleven, and we barely made it. We were in the hall, shedding coats, when I saw Mrs. Bruner's Rolls pull up out in front. When she reached the stoop I had the door

 open. Fred and Orrie started off, but I called them back.
==> "Mrs. Bruner," I said, "how would you like to meet three men who, working for you, rode sixty miles in a truck, curled up inside wooden boxes with the lids screwed on? And who stood for twenty minutes last evening with guns pointed at two FBI men while Mr. Wolfe told them things?" <==
"Why - I would like to."
"I thought so. Mr. Saul Panzer. Mr. Fred Durkin. Mr. Orrie Cather. You will spend some time with Mr. Panzer. If you don't mind, I'll put your coat in the front room. Richard Wragg, the top G-man in New York, is coming, and shouldn't see it."
Her eyes were wide but her mouth was closed. I decided to marry her in spite of her pile. As I took her coat Fred and Orrie headed for the stairs, to hang around outside the South Room and not let Jarvis and Kirby come down and interrupt the conversation.
At the kitchen end of the hall there is an alcove on the left, and around the corner in the alcove there is a hole in the wall at eye level. On the alcove side of the hole there is a sliding panel, and on the office side the hole is covered by a trick picture of a waterfall. If you stand in the alcove and open the panel you have a view of most of the office through the waterfall, and of course you can hear.
Taking Mrs. Bruner to the alcove, followed by Saul, I slid the panel and showed her the hole. "As I said," I told her, "Wragg is coming and will be in the office with Mr. Wolfe and me. Mr. Panzer will bring the stool from the kitchen, and you'll sit here on it, and he'll stand here. It will last anywhere from ten minutes to two hours, I don't know. You won't understand everything you hear, but you'll understand enough. If you feel a cough or sneeze coming, go to the kitchen fast on your toes. Saul will motion to you if - "

At the kitchen end of the hall there is an alcove on the left, and around the corner in the alcove there is a hole in the wall at eye level. On the alcove side of the hole there is a sliding panel, and on the office side the hole is covered by a trick picture of a waterfall. If you stand in the alcove and open the panel you have a view of most of the office through the waterfall, and of course you can hear.
==> Taking Mrs. Bruner to the alcove, followed by Saul, I slid the panel and showed her the hole. "As I said," I told her, "Wragg is coming and will be in the office with Mr. Wolfe and me. Mr. Panzer will bring the stool from the kitchen, and you'll sit here on it, and he'll stand here. It will last anywhere from ten minutes to two hours, I don't know. You won't understand everything you hear, but you'll understand enough. If you feel a cough or sneeze coming, go to the kitchen fast on your toes. Saul will motion to you if - " <==
The doorbell rang. I stuck my head around the alcove corner, and there he was on the stoop, five minutes ahead of time. I told Saul to get the stool, and as he headed for the kitchen I started down the hall. At the door I looked back, got a nod from him at the alcove corner, and opened the door.
Richard Wragg was forty-four years old. He lived in an apartment in Brooklyn with a wife and two children and had been with the FBI fifteen years. Detectives

 know things. He was about my height, with a long face and a pointed chin, and would be bald on top in four years, or maybe three. He didn't offer to shake, but he turned his back as I peeled his coat off, so he trusted me to a certain extent. When I ushered him to the office and to the red leather chair he stood and looked the room over, and I thought he was too interested in the picture of the waterfall, but perhaps not. He was still standing when the sound of the elevator came and Wolfe entered and stopped short of his desk to say, "Mr. Wragg? I'm Nero Wolfe. Be seated." As he went to his chair Wragg sat down, found he was only on the edge, and slid back.
Their eyes met. From my angle I couldn't see Wolfe's, but Wragg's were straight and steady.

"But now ours have. I assume that this is being recorded."
"No. There is equipment, but it isn't turned on. We might as well ignore such matters. I have assumed for a week that everything said in this house was overheard. You may have a device on your person. I might have my recorder going - though, as I say, I haven't. Let's ignore it."

"I want those credentials."

I went to the safe and got it. As I returned Wolfe nodded at Wragg, and I handed it to him. I stood there, and when he had read it I put out a hand. He read it again, slower, and handed it over without looking up at me, and I went to my desk and put it in a drawer.
"Quite a document," he told Wolfe. "For the record, if there was any espionage of Mrs. Bruner or her family or associates, which I am not admitting, it was in connection with a security check."
Wolfe nodded. "You say that, of course. A routine lie. I am describing the situation. Your men departed last night, leaving their credentials in my possession, because they dared not call on the police to rescue them. They knew that if a citizen charged them with the crime of entering his house illegally, and pushed the charge, the sympathy of the New York police and the District Attorney would be with the citizen. You know it too. You will not take legal steps to recover the credentials, so they will not be recovered. I shall keep them. I suggest an exchange.

"I haven't conceded the surveillance."
"Bah. If you - No. It's simpler to rephrase it. Disregarding the past, you engage that from six o'clock today there will be by your bureau no surveillance of Mrs. Bruner or her family or associates, or her house, which includes a wiretap, and no surveillance of Mr. Goodwin or me, or my house. I engage to leave the credentials where they are, in my safe-deposit box, to take no action against your men for their invasion of my premises, and to make public no disclosure of it. That's the situation, and that's my offer."

Wragg looked at me. I thought he was going to ask me something, but no, I was just a place to give his eyes a rest from Wolfe while he answered some question he had asked himself. It took him a while. Finally he went back to Wolfe.
"You've left something out," he said. "You say your sole purpose is to do the job you've been hired for. Then why have you been investigating a homicide we have no connection with? Why has Goodwin gone twice to see Mrs. David Althaus, and twice to Morris Althaus's apartment, and why did you have those six people here last Thursday evening?"

==> Wolfe got testy. "Confound it, sir, can't you talk sense? What could they have conceivably been after when they invaded my house? You suspected that I had somehow discovered that three of your men had been in Morris Aithaus's apartment the night he was killed, as indeed I had. They had reported to you that he was dead when they arrived, but you didn't believe them. At least you doubted them. I don't know why; you know them; I don't. And you suspected or feared that I had not only learned that they were there but had also secured <==

 evidence that they, one of them, had hilled him. Talk sense."
"You still haven't told me why you were investigating a homicide."
"Isn't that obvious? Because I had learned that your men had been there." "How did you learn that?"
Wolfe shook his head. "That's reserved."

"Have you been in touch with Inspector Cramer?"
"No. I haven't seen or spoken with him for months."
"Or the District Attorney's office?"
"No."
"Are you going to continue the investigation?"

"Have you been in touch with Inspector Cramer?"
"No. I haven't seen or spoken with him for months."
"Or the District Attorney's office?"
"No."
"Are you going to continue the investigation?"
==> A corner of Wolfe's mouth went up. "You know, Mr. Wragg, I am both able and willing to relieve your mind, but first I must be assured that I have done my job. Have you accepted my offer? Do you assure me that from six o'clock this afternoon there will be no surveillance of any kind by your bureau of Mrs. Bruner or anyone connected with her?" <==
"Yes. That's settled."
"Satisfactory. Now I ask you to make another engagement. I want you to return here, when requested by me, and bring the bullet which one of your men picked up on the floor of Morris Althaus's apartment."
It probably wasn't easy to faze Richard Wragg. You don't get to be the top G- man at the most important spot, next to Washington, if you faze easy. But that got him. His mouth came open. It took him only two seconds to close it, but he had been fazed.
"Now "you're" not talking sense," he said.
"But I am. If you'll bring me that bullet when I ask for it, it is next to certain - I am tempted to say certain - that I can establish that Althaus was not killed by one

"Now "you're" not talking sense," he said.
"But I am. If you'll bring me that bullet when I ask for it, it is next to certain - I am tempted to say certain - that I can establish that Althaus was not killed by one

 of your men.
"God, you're raw." Wragg's mouth wasn't open now. His eyes were narrowed to slits. "If I had such a bullet I might bring it just to call you."
==> "Oh, you have it." Wolfe was patient. "What happened that night in Althaus's apartment? A person I'll call X - I could give a better name, for now X will do - shot him with his own gun. The bullet went through him to the wall and fell to the floor. X departed, taking the gun. Soon your three men arrived, entering just as they entered this house last night. Shall I go into detail?" <==
"Yes."
"Here they didn't ring the bell because it was known, so they thought, that the house was empty. It had been under surveillance for a week. They rang Althaus's bell, and probably his telephone, but he didn't answer because he was dead. After they had searched the apartment and got what they had come for, it occurred to them that you would suspect that one of them had killed him, and as evidence that they hadn't they took the bullet, which was there on the floor. That violated a law of the State of New York, but they had already violated one, why not another? They took it and gave it to you with their report."
He flipped a hand. "Possibly their bringing the bullet, instead of convincing you of their innocence, had the opposite effect, but I won't speculate about your mental processes, why you didn't believe them. As I said, you know your men. But of course you still have the bullet, and I'm going to want it."
Wragg's eyes had stayed narrow. "Listen, Wolfe. You trapped us once, damn you. You trapped us good. But not again. If I had that bullet I wouldn't be sap enough to give it to "you"."
"You will be a sap if you don't." Wolfe made a face. There are a few slang words he likes and uses, but "sap" isn't one of them, and he had uttered it. He straightened his face. "I concern myself with this because I have an obligation - to the person from whom I learned that your men were there that night - and I don't like obligations. Exposing the murderer will cancel that debt and, incidentally, relieve your mind. Wouldn't you like it to be established that Althaus was not killed by one of your men? Bring me that bullet, and it will be. I make another offer: bring me that bullet, and if your men are not cleared within a month by disclosure of the murderer I'll give you those credentials. It shouldn't

Wragg ignored the dig. "When would you want the bullet - if I had it?"
"I don't know. Possibly later today. Or tomorrow. I would want to receive it from your hands."
"If I had it." Wragg stood up. "I have some thinking to do. I'm promising nothing. I'll - "
"But you are. You have. No surveillance of my client or me.
"That, yes. I mean - you know what I mean." He moved, then stopped and turned. "You'll be here all day?"
==> "Yes. But if you telephone, my line is tapped." He didn't think that was funny. I doubt if he would have thought anything whatever was funny. As I followed him to the hall and held his coat and handed him his hat, he didn't even know I was there. When I turned from shutting the door behind him I saw the client entering the office, Saul at her heels, and I decided not to marry her. She should have waited for me to come and escort her. When I reached the office there was a tableau. Mrs. Bruner and Saul were standing side by side at Wolfe's desk, looking down at him, and he was leaning back with his eyes closed. It was a nice <==

 picture, and I stopped at the door to enjoy it. Half a minute. A full minute. That was enough, since she had appointments, and as I crossed to them I asked, "Could you hear all right?"
Wolfe's eyes opened. Not answering me, she told him, "You're an incredible man. Utterly incredible. I didn't really think you could do it. Incredible. Is there "anything" you couldn't do?"
He straightened up. "Yes, madam," he said, "there is. I couldn't put sense in a fool's brain. I have tried. I could mention others. You understand why it was desirable for you to come. The letter you signed says 'if you get the result I desire.' Are you satisfied?"
"Of course I am. Incredible."

"I find it a little hard to believe, myself. Please sit down. There is something I must tell you."
"There certainly is." She went to the red leather chair. Saul went to a yellow one and I to mine. She asked, "What was the trap you set?"
Wolfe shook his head. "Not that. That can wait. Mr. Goodwin will give you all the details at your and his convenience. I must tell you not what has been done but what should now be done. You are my client and I must protect you from embarrassment. How discreet are you?"

She frowned. "Why do you ask that?"
"Please answer it. How discreet are you? Can you be trusted with a secret?"
"Yes."
His head turned. "Archie?"
Damn him anyway. It was all right to embarrass "me". What if I changed my mind again and decided to marry her?

"Yes," I said, "if I know where you're headed, and I think I do."
"Of course you do." To her: "I wish to save you the embarrassment of having your secretary taken from your office by the police, perhaps in your presence, to

 be questioned regarding a murder which she probably committed."
He had only fazed Wragg, but that staggered the client. Her mouth didn't drop open; she just stared, speechless.
==> "I say probably," Wolfe said, "but it is barely short of certainty. The victim was Morris Althaus. Mr. Goodwin will give you the details of this too, but not now, not until the situation has been resolved. I would have preferred not to give you even the bare fact now, but as my client you merit my protection. I wish to make a suggestion." <==
"I don't believe it," she said. "I want the details "now"."
"You won't get them." He was curt. "I have had a trying week, and night, and day. If you make this difficult too I'll leave the room and you'll leave the house, and probably question Miss Dacos. That will alarm her and she'll skedaddle, and after the police find her and bring her back they will have questions for you - civil questions, but many of them. Do you want that?"
"No."
"Do you think I would make so grave an accusation idly?"
"No."

"No."
"Nor would you have wanted the disagreeable surprise of sitting in your office with your secretary and having the police suddenly appear and drag her out."

 "No."
"Then you may thank me at your convenience for preventing it. You're not in a humor to thank anyone for anything at the moment. Shall Mr. Panzer go in your car with you, or separately? You could discuss it with him on the way. He is "not" a fool."
==> She looked at me and back at Wolfe. "Can Mr. Goodwin go?" <==
Saul has not yet heard the last of that. It didn't change my decision about marriage because I prefer to do the courting myself, but it gave me one on Saul. Wolfe told her no, Mr. Goodwin had work to do, and the poor woman had to settle for Saul. He brought her coat from the front room and held it for her, and I admit I had a pang. By the time they got to Seventy-fourth Street she would be appreciating him. Not wanting to intrude, I didn't go to the hall with them.
When the sound came of the front door closing Wolfe cocked his head at me and demanded, "Say something."
"Bejabers," I said. "Will that do? A guy I know named Bimbaum uses it to show he's not prejudiced. Bejabers."
"Satisfactory."
"All of that."

The office of the inspector in command of Homicide South on West Twentieth Street is not really shabby, but it's not for show. The linoleum floor has signs of

 wear, Cramer's desk would appreciate a sanding job, I have never seen the windows really clean, and the chairs, all but Cramer's, are plain, honest, hard wood. As I put my fundament on one of them at 2:35 p.m. he snapped at me, "I told you don't come and don't phone."
==> I nodded. "But it's okay now and I had to. Mr. Wolfe - " "What's okay?" <==
"He has earned the hundred grand "and" a fee."
"The hell he has. He has got them to quit on that Mrs. Bruner?" "Yes. Bejabers. But we haven't filled your order. We have - " "I didn't give any order."
"Oh, all right. We have learned that it wasn't a G-man who shot Morris Althaus. We think we know who did, and we think we know how it can be tagged. I'm not going to tell you how we put the screws on the FBI. That's not what I came for, and Mr. Wolfe will enjoy telling you some time at your leisure, and you'll enjoy listening. It was the longest shot he has ever played, and it hit. I'm here to talk homicide."
"Go ahead. Talk."
I reached to my breast pocket, took something out, and handed it to him. "I doubt if you've seen that before," I said, "but one or more of your men have. It was in a drawer in Althaus's bedroom. His mother gave me the keys, so don't book me for illegal entry. Look at the back."

He turned it over and read the poetry.
"That," I said, "is a take-off of the last four lines of the second stanza of Keats's 'Ode on a Grecian Urn.' Rather clever. It was written by Miss Sarah Dacos, Mrs. Bruner's secretary, who lives at Sixty-three Arbor Street, second floor, below Althaus's apartment. The way I know, I got samples of her handwriting from Mrs. Bruner. Here they are." I got them from a pocket and handed them over. "By the way, she saw the three G-men leave the house. From her window. Remember that when you're working on her."

"Working on her for what? This?" He tapped the photograph.
"No. The main thing I came for was to place a bet. One will get you fifty that if you get a warrant and comb her apartment you'll get something you'll appreciate. The sooner the better." I stood up. "That's all for now. We would - "
"Like hell it's all." His red round face was redder. "Sit down. I'll work on "you". What will we find and when did you put it there?"
==> "I didn't. Listen. As you know, when you deal with me you're dealing with Mr. Wolfe. You also know that I always stick to instructions. For the present I'm through. I stand mute. Any time you spend barking at me will be wasted. Get the warrant and use it, and if you find anything Mr. Wolfe will be glad to discuss it." <==
"I'll discuss it with you first. You'll stay right here."
"Not unless I'm put under arrest." I got sore. "What more do you want, for God's sake? You've had this homicide nearly two months! We've had it one week!"
I turned and walked out. It was even money I would be stopped, if not there by him then down on the ground floor when I left the elevator. But all I got, from the bull on duty in the downstairs hall, who knew me by sight, was a nod, not too friendly but almost human. I didn't loiter.
I crossed town to Sixth Avenue and turned south. Everything was under control at the old brownstone. Ashley Jarvis and Dale Kirby, not too badly hung over, had been fed a hearty breakfast and handed the bonus of one grand each, and had departed. Fred and Orrie had each been given three Cs for two days' work, not to mention nights, miles above scale, and had also departed. Saul was up at Mrs. Bruner's office getting ready to paint or plaster, whichever suited. Wolfe would of course be reading a book, certainly not "The FBI Nobody Knows", since he knew them now, anyhow three of them, and at four o'clock he would go up to the plant rooms, back on schedule. Since I never take an afternoon nap, even when I'm short on sleep, I could go for a walk, and did.
I came to a stop across the street from 63 Arbor Street. But the thermometer outside the front-room window had said sixteen above zero when I got up, and it had climbed only about five notches since, and I had the keys in my pocket, so I crossed the street, entered, and mounted the two flights to Althaus's apartment. I include this in the report not because it changed anything, but because I

"Like hell it's all." His red round face was redder. "Sit down. I'll work on "you". What will we find and when did you put it there?"
"I didn't. Listen. As you know, when you deal with me you're dealing with Mr. Wolfe. You also know that I always stick to instructions. For the present I'm through. I stand mute. Any time you spend barking at me will be wasted. Get the warrant and use it, and if you find anything Mr. Wolfe will be glad to discuss it."
"I'll discuss it with you first. You'll stay right here."
"Not unless I'm put under arrest." I got sore. "What more do you want, for God's sake? You've had this homicide nearly two months! We've had it one week!"
I turned and walked out. It was even money I would be stopped, if not there by him then down on the ground floor when I left the elevator. But all I got, from the bull on duty in the downstairs hall, who knew me by sight, was a nod, not too friendly but almost human. I didn't loiter.
==> I crossed town to Sixth Avenue and turned south. Everything was under control at the old brownstone. Ashley Jarvis and Dale Kirby, not too badly hung over, had been fed a hearty breakfast and handed the bonus of one grand each, and had departed. Fred and Orrie had each been given three Cs for two days' work, not to mention nights, miles above scale, and had also departed. Saul was up at Mrs. Bruner's office getting ready to paint or plaster, whichever suited. Wolfe would of course be reading a book, certainly not "The FBI Nobody Knows", since he knew them now, anyhow three of them, and at four o'clock he would go up to the plant rooms, back on schedule. Since I never take an afternoon nap, even when I'm short on sleep, I could go for a walk, and did. <==
I came to a stop across the street from 63 Arbor Street. But the thermometer outside the front-room window had said sixteen above zero when I got up, and it had climbed only about five notches since, and I had the keys in my pocket, so I crossed the street, entered, and mounted the two flights to Althaus's apartment. I include this in the report not because it changed anything, but because I

 remember so well my state of mind. Fifty-three hours had passed since I had put the gun under the box spring, and that was time enough for a healthy girl to find a dozen guns and put them somewhere else. If it wasn't there we would now be out on a limb, and a shaky one, since I had told Cramer. He knew Wolfe hadn't sent me there just on a suspicion or a hunch; he knew we knew there was something hot in that apartment, and if it was gone we were in for it. If I told him about the gun I would be admitting I had tampered with evidence; if I didn't, I would be suspected of something even worse, and good-by licenses.
You may not be interested in my state of mind, but believe me I was. At one of the front windows in Althaus's living room I pushed the drape aside and pressed my forehead against the glass so I could see the sidewalk below. That was fairly dumb, but a state of mind cars make you dumb. It was 3:25. I had left Cramer only thirty-five minutes ago, and it would take them about an hour to get the warrant, so what was I expecting to see? Also the glass was cold, and I backed away a couple of inches. But I was really on edge, and now and then I put my forehead to the glass again, and after a while I did see something. Sarah Dacos came in view on the sidewalk with a big brown paper bag under her arm and turned in at the entrance. It was ten minutes to four. Seeing her didn't help my state of mind any. I had nothing against Sarah Dacos. Of course I had nothing for her either. A woman who sends a bullet through a man's pump may or may not deserve some sympathy, but she damn well can't expect a stranger to take a detour if she gets in his way while he's doing a job.
Bending my ears, I heard the door of her apartment open and close.

Bending my ears, I heard the door of her apartment open and close.
At a quarter past four two police cars stopped out in front. One of them found a spot at the curb and the other one double-parked, and I recognized all three of the homicide dicks who got out and headed for Number 63. One of them, Sergeant Purley Stebbins, was probably thinking of me as he pushed the button at the door. He hates to find Nero Wolfe or me in the same county with a homicide, and here he was on an errand we were responsible for. I wanted to go to the hall to hear the conversation when he showed her the warrant, but didn't. He might smell me and it would hold up the search.
It took them not more than ten minutes to find it. They entered the apartment at 4:21, that was when I heard the door close, and Purley left the house with her at 4:43. I'm allowing twelve minutes for him to ask her a few questions after he got the gun. I stood at the window and watched Purley get in the car with her, and

 the car pull off, and then went and sat on the couch. Since he had taken her, the question about the gun was answered. I stayed on the couch a few minutes while my state of mind got adjusted.
I got my hat and coat and went. There was still a NYPD car out in front, waiting for the two dicks still in the apartment, and the driver might know me, but so what? I hadn't recognized him from the window, and I don't know if he knew me or not. As I walked past the car, no hurry, he gave me a hard eye, but that could have been because I had come out of that house.
I walked home. It was a little after half past five, dark, when I mounted the stoop and let myself in. I went to the kitchen, got a glass of milk, and asked Fritz, "Has he told you that we're off the hook?"

He leveled his eyes at me. "Archie, that is never to be mentioned. That terrible day. "Epouvantable." My mind was here with you. I don't know what I did, I don't know what was served. I will forget it if possible."
"Hewitt said on the phone that they stood and applauded you."
"But certainly. They were polite. I "know" I put no truffles in the "Perigourdine"."
"Good God. I'm glad I wasn't there. Okay, we'll forget it. May I have a carrot? It's wonderful with milk."
He said certainly, and I helped myself.
==> I was at my desk, making out checks to pay bills, when Wolfe came down from the plant rooms. Though he hadn't said so I knew he was as much on edge as I <==

 had been, and as he went to his desk I turned my head and said, "Relax. They got the gun."
"How do you know?"
I told him, beginning with the conversation with Cramer and ending with the conversation with Fritz. He asked if I had got a receipt for the photograph.
"No," I said, "he wasn't in a mood for signing receipts. I had told him that Althaus hadn't been killed by a G-man, and that hurt."

"No doubt. Will Mr. Wragg be at his office?" "He could be."
"Get him."
I turned and got the phone, but as I started to dial the doorbell rang. I cradled it and went to the hall for a look, turned, and said, "You can ask him for the receipt."
He took a breath. "Is he alone?"
I told him yes and went to the front and opened the door. Cramer didn't have a carton of milk for me. He had nothing at all for me, not even a nod. When I had his coat he made for the office, and when I got there he was planted in the red leather chair and talking. I got the end of it: "...and I might have known better. God knows I "should" know better." He switched to me as I sat. "Where did you get that gun and when did you put it there?"
==> "Confound it," Wolfe growled, "you shouldn't have come. You should have waited until you had arranged your mind. Archie, get Mr. Wragg." <==
When Cramer is boiling it isn't easy to stop the steam, but that did, the name Wragg. I didn't see him clamp his jaw and glare at Wolfe, I only knew he did, because my back was turned as I dialed LE5-7700. I was supposing it would take patience and staying power to get through to the top, but not at all. Apparently word had been passed down that a call from Nero Wolfe had priority, which was a good sign. In no time the smooth low-pitched drawl was in my ear, and in Wolfe's too, for he had picked up his phone. I stayed on.

"Wolfe?"
"Yes. Mr. Wragg?" "Yes."
"I'm ready for that bullet. Now. As we agreed. Bring the bullet, and I surrender the credentials if you are not satisfied within a month. I think it will be sooner, much sooner.

"Yes. I suggest that you postpone your onslaught until he arrives - and, perhaps, goes - and meanwhile I'll describe an operation which has been concluded. I have told Mr. Wragg that I will make no public disclosure of it, but you are not the public, and since you made it possible I owe it to you. But it will help in dealing with him if you will answer two questions. Was a gun found in Miss Dacos's apartment?"
"Certainly. I just asked Goodwin when he put it there, and I'm going to ask him again."
"You may not after we finish with Mr. Wragg. Was it the gun Morris Althaus had a permit for?"
"Yes."

When he came to the scene in the office, with the two G-men completely surrounded by guns and him dropping their credentials in his drawer, I saw something I had never seen before and will probably never see again, a broad smile on the face of Inspector Cramer. And it was there again when, reporting the conversation with Wragg that morning, Wolfe came to where he had told him that his word was much better.

I have mentioned that Wragg was fazed when Wolfe asked him to bring the bullet, but that was nothing compared to the jolt he got when he walked into the office and saw Cramer. I was behind him and couldn't see his face, but I saw him go stiff and his fingers curl. Cramer, on his feet, started a hand out but took it back.
As I brought a yellow chair Wragg spoke to Wolfe. "Your word? Better than mine? You goddam skunk!"
"Sit down," Wolfe said. "Whether my word is better or not, my brain is. I don't judge a situation before I understand it. Mr. Cramer is - "
"All agreements are off."

You, Mr. Wragg, want it made manifest that your men are not criminally implicated in a murder. You, Mr. Cramer, want to identify and bring to account the person who killed Morris Althaus. It couldn't be simpler. You, Mr. Wragg, give Mr. Cramer the bullet you have in your pocket and tell him where it came from. You, Mr. Cramer, have a comparison made of that bullet with one fired from the gun which was taken this afternoon from the apartment of Sarah Dacos, and along with other evidence which no doubt your men are securing now, that will settle it. There is no - " <==
"I haven't said I have a bullet in my pocket."
"Nonsense. I advise you to pull in your horns, Mr. Wragg. Mr. Cramer has good reason to suppose that you have on your person an essential item of evidence in a homicide which occurred in his jurisdiction. Under the statutes of the State of New York he may legally search you, here and now, and get it. Is that correct, Mr. Cramer?"
"Yes."
"But," Wolfe told Wragg, "that shouldn't be necessary. You do have a brain. Obviously it is to your interest and that of your bureau that you give Mr. Cramer that bullet."
"The hell it is," Wragg said. "And one of my men gets on the stand and says under oath that he was in that apartment and took it? The hell it is."

"My men are not perjurers," Cramer said.
"Bah. This is not being recorded. If Mr. Wragg hands you a bullet and says it was found on the floor of Morris Althaus's apartment around eleven o'clock in the evening of Friday, November twentieth, will you believe him?"

"He might not be posing," Wragg cut in. "He might go on the stand himself and tell how he got it. Then I'm called to the stand."
==> Wolfe nodded. "Fine. He might. But he wouldn't. If he did, I too would be called to the stand, and Mr. Goodwin, and a much larger audience than this one would learn how the murderer of Morris Althaus had been disclosed after the police and the District Attorney had spent eight futile weeks on it. He wouldn't." <==
"Damn you," Cramer said. "Both of you."
Wolfe looked at the clock. "It's past my dinner hour, gentlemen. I've said all I have to say, and I have disposed of my obligation. Do you want to settle it, or mulishly fail to, elsewhere?"
Wragg looked at Cramer. "Do you see anything wrong with it?"
The eyes of the cop and the Gman met and held. "No," Cramer said. "Do you?" "No. You have the gun?"
"Yes." Cramer turned to Wolfe. "You said I might not ask Goodwin after we finished with Wragg. I won't. I may later if we hit a snag. I would only get a runaround, and to hell with it." He went back to Wragg. "It's up to you.

Wragg's hand went to a pocket and came out with a little plastic vial. He rose and took a step. "This bullet," he said, "was found on the floor of Morris Althaus's apartment, in the living room, around eleven o'clock in the evening on Friday, November twentieth. Now it's yours. I have never seen it."
Cramer stood up to take it. He removed the lid of the vial, let the bullet drop into his palm, inspected it, and returned it to the vial.

==> Three evenings later, Monday around half past six, Wolfe and I were in the office, debating a point about the itemization of expenses to go with the bill to Mrs. Bruner. I admit it was a minor point, but it was a matter of principle. He was maintaining that it was just and proper to include the lunch at Rusterman's, on the ground that the meals we got there were in consideration of services he had rendered and was still rendering to the restaurant and so were not actually gratis. My position was that the past services had already been rendered, and the present ones would be rendered, even if she and I had gone to the Automat for lunch. <==
"I realize," I said, "that you're up against it. Even if you push the fee to the limit, say another hundred grand, it still might not be enough to last the whole year, and around Labor Day, or at least Thanksgiving, you might have to take on a job, so you need to squeeze out every nickel you can. But she has been a marvelous client, and you should have some consideration for her, and indirectly for me too in case I decide to marry her. She has a lot of other expenses besides you, and now she'll have another one, now that she's going to supply a high- priced lawyer to defend Sarah Dacos. Have a heart."
"As you know, Miss Dacos has confessed."
"So she'll need a lawyer even more. I feel very strongly about this. I invited her to lunch. I am almost prepared to say that if she is billed for it I will feel that I must tell her privately that it was on the house. She may want - "
The doorbell rang. I got up and went to the hall and saw a character on the stoop I had never seen before, but I had seen plenty of pictures of him. I stepped back in and said, "Well, well. The "big" fish."
He frowned at me, then got it, and did something he never does. He left his chair and came. We stood side by side, looking. The caller put a finger to the button, and the doorbell rang.

"Skip it. Any time now, any minute, I may be hauled in on a charge of murder, and then where am I? Or suppose I somehow made it stick that I did not agree to meet you there, that you’re lying to them, and I wasn’t there. Then where will you be? The way it stands, the way you’ve staged it, today or tomorrow either you or I will be in the jug with no out. So either I - "
"But Archie, you - "
"Don’t interrupt. Either I wriggle off by selling them on you - and by the way, I haven’t asked you." I got up and went to her. "Stand up. Look at me." I extended my hands at waist level, open, palms up. "Put your hands on mine, palms down. No, don’t press, relax, just let them rest there. Damn it, relax! Right. Look at me. Did you kill Ken?"
"No."
"Again. Did you kill him?" "No, Archie!"
==> I turned and went back to my chair. She came a step forward, backed up, and sat. "That’s my private lie detector," I told her. "Not patented. Either I wriggle off by selling them on you, and it would take some wriggling, which is not my style, or I do a job that is my style - I hope. As you know, I work for Nero Wolfe. First I see him and tell him I’m taking a leave of absence - I hope a short one. Then you and I go some place where we’re sure we won’t be interrupted, and you tell me things, a lot of things, and no fudging. Where I go from there depends on what you tell me. I’ll tell you one thing now, if you - " <==
The door opened and Wolfe was there. He crossed to the corner of his desk,

 faced her, and spoke. "I’m Nero Wolfe. Will you please move to this chair?" He indicated the red leather chair by a nod, circled around his desk, and sat. He looked at me. "A job that is your style?"
Well. As I remarked when he insisted that I see her in the office, if I hadn’t been pooped I would have given that offer a little attention. If I had been myself I would have known, or at least suspected, what he intended. I suppose he and I came as close to trusting each other as any two men can, on matters of joint concern, but as he had told Parker, this was my affair, and I was discussing it with someone in his office, keeping him away from his favorite chair, and I had just told him that nothing of what I had told Cramer was flummery. So he had gone to the hole in the alcove.
I looked back at him. "I said I hope. What if I heard the panel open and steered clear?"

"Pfui. Clear of what?"
"Okay. Your trick. But I think she has a right to know."
"I agree." Sue had moved to the red leather chair, and he swiveled. "Miss McLeod. I eavesdropped, without Mr. Goodwin’s knowledge. I heard all that was said, and I saw. Do you wish to complain?"

Of course it was possible the murderer was someone Sue had never heard of and the motive had no connection with her, but that would make it really tough, and there she was, and Wolfe got all she had - or at least everything she would turn loose of. She didn’t know how many different men she had had dates with in the twenty months she had been modeling - maybe thirty. More in the first year than recently; she had thought it would help to get jobs if she knew a lot of men, and it had, but now she turned down as many jobs as she accepted. When she said she didn’t know why so many men wanted to date her Wolfe made a face, but I

she really meant it. It was hard to believe that a girl with so much born come-on actually wasn’t aware of it, but I knew her, and so did my friend Lily Rowan, who is an expert on women.
She didn’t know how many of them had asked her to marry them; maybe ten; she hadn’t kept count. Of course you don’t like her; to like a girl who says things like that, you’d have to see her and hear her, and if you’re a man you wouldn’t stop to ask whether you liked her or not. I frankly admit that the fact that she couldn’t dance had saved me a lot of wear and tear.
From the time she had met Ken Faber she had let up on dates, and in recent months she had let only three other men take her places. Those three had all asked her to marry them, and they had stuck to it in spite of Ken Faber. Carl Heydt, who had given her her first modeling job, was nearly twice her age, but that wouldn’t matter if she wanted to marry him when the time came. Peter Jay, who was something important in a big advertising agency, was younger, and Max Maslow, who was a fashion photographer, was still younger.
==> She had told Carl Heydt that what Ken had told him wasn’t true, but she wasn’t sure that he had believed her. She couldn’t remember exactly what Peter Jay and Max Maslow had said that made her think that Ken had told them too; she hadn’t had the suspicion until Monday, when Carl had told her what Ken had told him. She had told no one that she was going to Rusterman’s Tuesday to see Ken. All three of them knew about the corn delivery to Rusterman’s and Nero Wolfe; they knew she had made the deliveries for two summers and had kidded her about it; Peter Jay had tried to get her to pose in a cornfield, in an evening gown, for a client of his. They knew Ken was working at the farm and was making the deliveries. From the notebook, Wolfe speaking: "You know those men quite well. You know their temperaments and bents. If one of them, enraged beyond endurance by Mr. Faber’s conduct, went there and killed him, which one? Remembering it was not a sudden fit of passion, it was premeditated, planned. From your knowledge of them, which one?" <==
She was staring. "They didn’t."
"Not ‘they.’ One of them. Which?" She shook her head. "None of them."
Wolfe wiggled a finger at her. "That’s twaddle, Miss McLeod. You may be shocked at the notion that someone close to you is a murderer; anyone would be;

 but you may not reject it as inconceivable. By your foolish subterfuge you have made it impossible to satisfy the police that neither you nor Mr. Goodwin killed that man except by one procedure: demonstrate that someone else killed him, and identify him. I must see those three men, and, since I never leave my house on business, they must come to me. Will you get them here? At nine o’clock this evening?"

He grunted. "Have you finished it?" "Yes. Twelve pages."
"May I see it?"
Not an order, a request. At least he was remembering that it was a joint affair. I opened a drawer, got the original, and took it to him. He inspected the heading

 and the first page, flipped through the sheets, took a look at the end, dropped it on his desk, and said, "Your notebook, please." I sat and got my notebook and pen.
==> "There will be two," he said, "one for you and one for me. First mine. Heading in caps, affidavit by Nero Wolfe. The usual State of New York, County of New York. The text: I hereby depose that the twelve foregoing typewritten pages attached hereto, comma, each page initialed by me, comma, are a full and accurate record of a conversation that took place in my office on October thirteenth, nineteen sixty-one, by Susan McLeod, comma, Archie Goodwin, comma, and myself, semicolon; that nothing of consequence has been omitted or added in this typewritten record, semicolon; and that the conversation was wholly impromptu, comma, with no prior preparation or arrangement. A space for my signature, and below, the conventional formula for notarizing. The one for you, on the same sheet if there is room, will be the same with the appropriate changes." <==
I looked up. "All right, it wasn’t just to keep me off your neck. Okay on the power. But there’s still the if on the preference. She didn’t kill him. She came to me and opened the bag. I’m her hero. She as good as told Maslow that she’d marry me if I asked her. Maybe she could learn how to dance if she tried hard, though I admit that’s doubtful. She makes a lot more than you pay me, and we could postpone the babies. You said you doubt if she would be convicted, but that’s not good enough. Before I sign that affidavit I would need to know that you won’t chuck the joint affair as soon as the heat is off of me."
"Rrrhhh," he said.
"I agree," I said, "it’s a goddam nuisance. It’s entirely her fault, she dragged me in without even telling me, and if a girl pushes a man in a hole he has a right to wiggle out, but you must remember that I am now a hero. Heroes don’t wiggle. Will you say that it will be our joint affair to make sure that she doesn’t go to trial?"
"I wouldn’t say that I will make sure of anything whatever." "Correction. That you will be concerned?"
He took air in, all the way, through his nose, and let it out through his mouth. "Very well. I’ll be concerned." He glanced at the twelve pages on his desk. "Will

10/14 SP exp AG 100
I put it back, shut the door, twirled the knob, and considered Wolfe had summoned Saul, and he had come and had been given an errand for which he needed a car. What errand, for God’s sake? Not to drive to Putman County to get the corn that had been ordered for Friday; for that he wouldn’t need to start in the morning, he wouldn’t need a hundred bucks for possible expenses, and the entry wouldn’t say "exp AG." It shouldn’t say that anyway since I wasn’t a paying client; it should say "exp JA" for joint affair. And if we were going to split the outlay I should damn well have been consulted beforehand. But up in my room, as I took off and put on, what was biting me was the errand. In the name of the Almighty Lord or J. Edgar Hoover, whichever you prefer, what and where was the errand?
Wolfe eats breakfast in his room from a tray taken up by Fritz, and ordinarily I don’t see him until he comes down from the plant rooms at eleven o’clock. If he has something important or complicated for me he sends word by Fritz for me to go up to his room; for something trivial he gets me on the house phone. That Friday morning there was neither word by Fritz nor the buzzer, and after a late and leisurely breakfast in the kitchen, having learned nothing new from the report of developments in the morning papers on the Sweet Corn Murder, as the Gazette called it, I went to the office and opened the mail. If Wolfe saw fit to

ep Saul’s errand strictly private, he could eat wormy old corn boiled in water before I’d ask him. I decided to go out for a walk and was starting for the kitchen to tell Fritz when the phone rang. I got it, and a woman said she was the secretary of Mr. Bernard Ross, counsel for Miss Susan McLeod, and Mr. Ross would like very much to talk with Mr. Wolfe and Mr. Goodwin at their earliest convenience. He would greatly appreciate it if they would call at his office today, this morning if possible.
==> I would have enjoyed telling Wolfe that Bernard Ross, the celebrated attorney, didn’t know that Nero Wolfe, the celebrated detective, never left his house to call on anyone whoever, but since I wasn’t on speaking terms with him I had to skip it. I told the secretary that Wolfe couldn’t but I could and would, went and told Fritz I would probably be back for lunch, put a carbon copy of the twelve- page conversation with affidavits in my pocket, and departed. <==
I did get back for lunch, just barely. Including the time he took to study the document I had brought, Ross kept me a solid two hours and a half. When I left he knew nearly everything I did, but not quite; I omitted a few items that were immaterial as far as he was concerned - for instance, that Wolfe had sent Saul Panzer somewhere to do something. Since I couldn’t tell him where, to do what, there was no point in mentioning it.
I would have preferred to buy my lunch somewhere, say at Rusterman’s, rather than sit through a meal with Wolfe, but he would be the one to gripe, not me, if he didn’t know where I was. Entering his house, and hearing him in the dining room speaking to Fritz, I went first to the office, and there on my desk under a paperweight were four sawbucks. Leaving them there, I went to the dining room and said good morning, though it wasn’t.
He nodded and went on dishing shrimps from a steaming casserole. "Good afternoon. That forty dollars on your desk can be returned to the safe. Saul had no expenses and I gave him sixty dollars for his six hours."
"His daily minimum is eighty."
"He wouldn’t take eighty. He didn’t want to take anything, since this is our personal affair, but I insisted. This shrimp Bordelaise is without onions but has some garlic. I think an improvement, but Fritz and I invite your opinion."

question had arisen whether he was more pigheaded than I was strong- minded. I was supposed to explode. I was supposed to demand to know where and how Saul had spent the six hours, and he would then be good enough to explain that he had got an idea last night in my absence, and, not knowing where I was, he had had to call Saul. So I wouldn’t explode. I would eat shrimp Bordelaise without onions but with garlic and like it. Obviously, whatever Saul’s errand had been, it had been a washout, since he had returned and reported and been paid off. So it was Wolfe’s move, since he had refused to see the three candidates when they came and rang the bell, and I would not explode. Nor would I report on last night or this morning unless and until he asked for it. Back in the office after lunch, he got settled in his favorite chair with My Life in Court, and I brought a file of cards from the cabinet and got busy with the germination records. At one minute to four he put his book down and went to keep his date with the orchids. It would have been a pleasure to take the Marley .32 from the drawer and plug him in the back.
I was at my desk, looking through the evening edition of the Gazette that had just been delivered, when I heard a noise I couldn’t believe. The elevator. I looked at my watch: half past five. That was unprecedented. He never did that. Once in the plant rooms he stuck there for the two hours, no matter what. If he had a notion that couldn’t wait he buzzed me on the house phone, or Fritz if I wasn’t there. I dropped the paper and got up and stepped to the hall. The elevator jolted to a stop at the bottom, the door opened, and he emerged.
"The corn," he said. "Has it come?"
For Pete’s sake. Being finicky about grub is all right up to a point, but there’s a limit. "No," I said. "Unless Saul brought it."
He grunted. "A possibility occurred to me. When it comes - if it comes - no. I’ll see for myself. The possibility is remote, but it would be - "
==> "Here it is," I said. "Good timing." A man with a carton had appeared on the stoop. As I started to the front the door bell rang, and as I opened the door Wolfe was there beside me. The man, a skinny little guy in pants too big for him and a bright green shirt, spoke. "Nero Wolfe?" <==
"I’m Nero Wolfe." He was on the sill. "You have my corn?" "Right here." He put the carton down and let go of the cord.

May I have your name, sir?"
"My name’s Palmer. Delbert Palmer. Why?"
"I like to know the names of men who render me a service. Did you pick the corn?"

 carton was on it. I moved up one of the yellow ones, and he sat, took his hat off and dropped it on the floor, and asked Wolfe, "What is this, a gag?"
Wolfe shook his head. "It may be a bugaboo, but I’m not crying wolf. I can tell you nothing until we know what’s in the carton."
"The hell you can’t. When did it come?" "One minute before I telephoned you." "Who brought it?"
"A stranger. A man I had never seen before." "Why do you think it’s dynamite?"
"I think it may be. I reserve further information until - "
==> I missed the rest because the doorbell rang and I went. It was the bomb squad, two of them. They were in uniform, but one look and you knew they weren’t flatties - if nothing else, their eyes. When I opened the door I saw another one down on the sidewalk, and their special bus, with its made-to-order enclosed body, was double-parked in front. I asked, "Bomb squad?" and the shorter one said, "Right," and I convoyed them to the office. Cramer, on his feet, returned their salute, pointed to the carton, and said, "It may be just corn. I mean the kind of corn you eat. Or it may not. Nero Wolfe thinks not. He also thinks it’s safe until the flaps are opened, but you’re the experts. As soon as you know, phone me here. How long will it take?" <==
"That depends, Inspector. It could be an hour, or ten hours - or it could be never."
"I hope not never. Will you call me here as soon as you know?" "Yes, sir."
The other one, the taller one, had stooped to press his ear against the carton and kept it there. He raised his head, said, "No comment," eased his fingers under the carton’s bottom, a hand at each side, and came up with it. I said, "The man who brought it carried it by the cord," and got ignored. They went, the one with the carton in front, and I followed to the stoop, watched them put it in the bus, and

 returned to the office. Cramer was in the red leather chair, and Wolfe was speaking.

"Of course not. I know. Of course not. I tell myself I’ll have to forget it ... but it’s not easy..." She shivered. "Anyway I wanted to say I don’t hate you. You don’t have to dance with me, and you know I’m not going to get married until I can stop working and have babies, and I know you never are, and even if you do it will be Lily, but you don’t have to stand there and let me really freeze, do you?"
I didn’t. You don’t have to be rude, even with a girl who can’t dance, and it was cold out there.

BLOOD WILL TELL
REX STOUT
==> NATURALLY MOST OF THE ITEMS in the mail that is delivered to the old brownstone on West 35th Street are addressed to Nero Wolfe, but since I both work and live there eight or ten out of a hundred are addressed to me. It is my custom to let my share wait until after I have opened Wolfe’s, looked it over, and put it on his desk, but sometimes curiosity butts in. As it did that Tuesday morning when I came to an elegant cream-colored envelope, outsize, addressed to me on a typewriter, with the return address in the corner engraved in dark brown: <==
JAMES NEVILLE VANCE
Two Nineteen Horn Street New York 12 New York
Never heard of him. It wasn’t flat; it bulged with something soft inside. Like everybody else, I occasionally get envelopes containing samples of something that bulges them, but not expensive envelopes with engraving that isn’t phony. So I slit it open and removed the contents. A folded sheet of paper that matched the envelope, including the engraved name and address, had a message typed in the center:
Archie Goodwin - Keep this until you hear from me. JNV
"This" was a necktie, a four-in-hand, neatly folded to go in the envelope. I stretched it out - long, narrow, maybe silk, light tan, almost the same color as the stationery, with thin brown diagonal lines. A Sutcliffe label, so certainly silk, say twenty bucks. But he should have sent it to the cleaners instead of me, because it had a spot, a big one two inches long, near one end, about the same tone of brown as the thin lines; but the lines’ brown was clean and live and the spot’s brown was dirty and dead. I sniffed at it, but I am not a beagle. Having seen a few dried bloodstains here and there, I knew the dirty color was right, but that’s

I sniffed at it, but I am not a beagle. Having seen a few dried bloodstains here and there, I knew the dirty color was right, but that’s

 no phenolphthalin test. Even so, I told myself as I dropped the tie in a drawer, supposing that James Neville Vance worked in a butcher shop and forgot his bib, why pick on me? As I closed the drawer I shrugged.
That’s the way to take it when you get a bloodstained (maybe) necktie in the mail from a stranger, just shrug, but I admit that in the next couple of hours I did something and didn’t do something else. What I did do was ring Lon Cohen at the Gazette to ask a question, and an hour later he called back to say that James Neville Vance, now in his late fifties, still owned all the real estate he had inherited from his father, still spent winters on the Riviera, and was still a bachelor; and what did he want of a private detective? I reserved that. What I didn’t do was take a walk. When nothing is stirring and Wolfe has given me no program I usually go out after the routine morning chores to work my legs and have a look at the town and my fellow men, not to mention women, but that morning I skipped it because JNV might come or phone. It had been an honest shrug, but you can’t shrug all day.
I might as well have had my walk because the phone call didn’t come until a quarter past eleven, after Wolfe had come down to the office from his two-hour morning session with the orchids up in the plant rooms on the roof. He had put a spray of Cymbidium Doris in the vase on his desk and got his personal seventh of a ton disposed in his oversize custom-made chair, and was scowling at the dust jacket of a book, one of the items that had been addressed to him, when the phone rang and I got it.
==> "Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie Goodwin speaking." "Is this Archie Goodwin?" <==
Three people out of ten will do that. I am always tempted to say no, it’s a trained dog, and see what comes next, but I might get barked at. So I said, "It is. In person."
"This is James Neville Vance. Did you receive something in the mail from me?"
His voice couldn’t decide whether to be a squeak or a falsetto and had the worst features of both. "Yes, presumably," I said. "Your envelope and letterhead."
"And an enclosure." "Right."

It was a baritone, no trace of a squeak. I told the grill, "I have something that belongs to you and I want to return it."
"You have something that belongs to me?" "Right."
"What is it and where did you get it?"
"Correction. I think it belongs to you. It’s a four-in-hand silk tie, Sutcliffe label, the same color as this house, with diagonal lines the same color as the trim. Cream and brown."
"Who are you and where did you get it?"
==> I got impatient. "Here’s a suggestion," I said. "Install closed-circuit television so you can see the vestibule from up there, and phone me at the office of Nero Wolfe, where I work, and I’ll come back. It will take a week or so and set you back ten grand, but it’ll be worth it to see the tie without letting me in. After you’ve identified it I’ll tell you where I got it. If you don’t - " <==
"Did you say Nero Wolfe? The detective?"


"Yes."
"But what - This is ridiculous."

"It must be mine. I can settle that. Come along."
He headed for the rear and I followed, back beyond the second piano, and then down spiral stairs, wide for a spiral, with carpeted steps and a polished wooden rail. At the bottom, the rear end of a good-sized living room, he turned right through an open door and we were in a bedroom. He crossed to another door and opened it, and I stopped two steps off. It was a walk-in closet. A friend of mine once told me that a woman’s clothes closet will tell you more about her than any other room in the house, and if that goes for a man too there was my chance to get the lowdown on James Neville Vance, but I was interested only in his neckties. They were on a rack at the right, three rows of them, quite an assortment, some cream and brown but by no means all. He fingered through part of one row, repeated it, turned and emerged, and said, "It’s mine. I had nine and gave one to somebody, and there are only seven." He shook his head. "I can’t imagine ..." He let it hang. "What on earth ..." He let that hang too.
"And your stationery," I said.
"Yes. Of course."
"And the phone call telling me to burn it. With a squeak." "Yes. You asked if I had any ideas or suggestions. Have you?"
==> "I could have, but they would be expensive. I work for Nero Wolfe and it would be on his time, and the bill would be bad news. You must know who has access to your stationery and that closet, and you ought to be able to make some kind of a guess about who and why. And you won’t need the tie. It came to me in the mail, so actually and legally it’s in my possession, and I ought to keep it." I put a hand out. "If you don’t mind?" <==
"Of course." He handed it over. "But I might - You’re not going to burn it?"
"No indeed." I stuck it in my side pocket. The envelope and letterhead were back in my breast pocket. "I have a little collection of souvenirs. If and when you have occasion to produce it for - "
A bell tinkled somewhere, a soft music tinkle, possibly music of the future. He frowned and turned and started for the front, and I followed, back through the

 open door, and across the living room to another door, which he opened. Two men were there in a little foyer - one a square little guy in shirt sleeves and brown denim pants, and the other, also square but big, a harness bull.

"No, sir. I took it to Ludlow and it’s human blood. So I gave it to Cramer. Of
course you’ve read the Times?" "Yes."
"The blood is the same type as Mrs. Kirk’s. If it was or is a floundering numskull, obviously I’d better see - "
The doorbell rang.
I got up and went, telling myself it was even money it was James Neville Vance, but it wasn’t. A glance at the one-way glass panel in the front door settled that. It was a panhandler who had run out of luck and started ringing doorbells - a tall, lanky one pretending he had to lean against the jamb to keep himself upright. Opening the door, I said politely, "It’s a hard life. Good morning."
==> He got me in focus with bleary eyes and said, "I would like to see Nero Wolfe. <==

 My name is Martin Kirk."
If you think I should have recognized him from the pictures Lon had shown me, I don’t agree. You should have seen him. I told him Mr. Wolfe saw people only by appointment, but I’d ask. "You’re the Martin Kirk who lives at Two-nineteen Horn Street?"
He said he was, and I invited him in, ushered him into the front room and to a seat, which he evidently needed, went to the office by way of the connecting door, closed the door, and crossed to Wolfe’s desk. "I’m on my own time now," I told him. "It’s Martin Kirk. He asked to see you, but of course you’re not interested. May I use the front room?"
He took a deep breath, in through his nose and out through his mouth, then glared at me for five seconds and growled, "Bring him in."

"But you don’t - " "Bring him."
==> Unheard of. Absolutely contrary to nature - his nature. The Nero Wolfe I thought I knew would at least have wanted me to pump him first. With a genius you never know. As I returned to the front room and told Kirk to come, I decided that the idea must be to show me that I would be a sap to waste my time. He would make short work of Martin Kirk. So as Kirk flopped into the red leather chair near the end of Wolfe’s desk he snapped at him, "Well, sir? I have read the morning paper. Why do you come to me?" <==
Kirk pressed the heels of his palms against his eyes. He groaned. He lowered his hands and the bleary eyes blinked a dozen times. "You’ll have to make allowances," he said. "I just left the district attorney’s office. I was there all night and no sleep."
"Have you eaten?" "My God no."
Wolfe made a face. That complicated it. The mere thought of a man going without food was disagreeable, and to have one there in his house was intolerable. He had to either get him out in a hurry or feed him. "Why should I

 make allowances?" he demanded.

"That’s what I want, your services."
"You want to hire me to investigate this affair?" "Yes. That’s why I’m here."
"And you can pay me without undue strain?" "Yes. I have - Yes. Do you want a check now?"

 thousand dollars will do as a retainer."
==> I had to shut my eyes a second to keep from gawking. That wasn’t only unheard of, it was unbelievable. Taking on a job, which meant that he would have to work, without the usual dodging and stalling - that could be on account of the lag in receipts; but taking a murder suspect for a client offhand, no questions asked but the routine did you kill her and can you pay me, without the faintest notion whether he was guilty or not and how much the cops had on him - that simply wasn’t done, not by anybody, let alone Nero Wolfe. I had to clamp my teeth on my lip to sit and take it. As Kirk got out a checkfold and a pen Wolfe pushed a button on his desk, and in a moment Fritz came. <==
"A tray, please," Wolfe told him. "The madrilène is ready?" "Yes, sir."
"And the pudding?"
"Yes, sir."
"A bowl of each, cheese with water cress, and hot tea."
When Fritz turned and went I would have liked to go along, to tell him that there could be something worse than having no client.

 to a bar and bought a drink but didn’t drink it. I wanted to know if her things were there, and I thought of phoning Jimmy Vance, but finally decided to phone police headquarters instead. Even if they found her there and someone with her, that might - "
The doorbell rang, and I went, again giving myself even money that it was Vance, and losing again. It was a girl, or woman, and she had a kind of eyes that I had met only twice before, once a woman and once a man. I have a habit, when it’s a stranger on the stoop, of taking a five-second look through the one-way glass and tagging him or her, to see how close I can come. From inside, the view through the glass is practically clear, but from the outside it might as well be wood. But she could see through. Of course she couldn’t, but she was face-to- face with me, and her eyes, slanted up, had exactly the look they would have if she were seeing me. They were nice enough hazel eyes, but I hadn’t liked it the other two times it had happened, and I didn’t like it then. Not trying to tag her, I opened the door.
"I beg your pardon," she said. "I believe Mr. Kirk is here? Martin Kirk?"
It wasn’t possible. They wouldn’t put a female dick on his tail, and even if they did she wouldn’t be it, with that attractive little face and soft little voice. But there she was. "I beg your pardon," I said, "but what makes you think so?"
"He must be. I saw him come in and I haven’t seen him come out." "Then he’s here. And?"
==> "Would you mind telling me whose house - who lives here?" "Nero Wolfe. It’s his house and he lives here." <==
"That’s an odd name. Nero Wolfe? What does he - Is he a lawyer?"
Either she meant it or she was extremely good. If the former, it would be a pleasure to tell Wolfe and see him grunt. "No," I said. Let her work for it.
"Is Mr. Kirk all right?"
"We haven’t been introduced," I said. "My name is Archie Goodwin and I live here. Your turn."

"We haven’t been introduced," I said. "My name is Archie Goodwin and I live here. Your turn."


Her mouth opened and closed again. She considered it, her eyes meeting mine exactly as they had when she couldn’t see me. "I’m Rita Fougere," she said. "Mrs. Paul Fougere. Will you tell Mr. Kirk I’m here and would like to see him?"
It was my turn to consider. The rule didn’t apply - the rule that I am to take no one in to Wolfe without consulting him; she wanted to see Kirk, not Wolfe. And I was riled. The tie had been mailed to me, not him, but he hadn’t even glanced at me before taking Kirk on and feeding him. I was by no means satisfied that Kirk was straight, and I wanted to see how he took it when Paul Fougere’s wife suddenly appeared.
==> "You might as well tell him yourself," I said. "Also you might as well know that Nero Wolfe is a private detective, and so am I. Come in." <==
I made room for her and she entered, and after shutting the door I preceded her down the hall and into the office. As I approached Wolfe’s desk I said, "Someone to see Mr. Kirk," and I was right there when he twisted around and saw her, said "Rita!" and left the chair. She offered both hands, and he took them. "Martin, Martin," she said, low, with those eyes at him.
"But how ..." He let her hands go. "How did you know I was here?" "I followed you."
"Followed me?"
She nodded. "From down there. I was there too, and when I left and had got into a taxi you came out. I called to you but you didn’t hear me, and when you got another taxi I told my driver to follow. I saw you come in here, and I waited outside, and when you didn’t come out, a whole hour - "
"But what - You shouldn’t, Rita. You can’t - There’s nothing you can do. Were you there all night too?"

"But what - You shouldn’t, Rita. You can’t - There’s nothing you can do. Were you there all night too?"
"No, just this morning. I was afraid - your face, the way you looked. I was terribly afraid. I know I can’t - or maybe I can. If you’ll come - Have you eaten anything?"
==> "Yes. I thought I couldn’t, but Nero Wolfe - " He stopped and turned. "I’m sorry. Mr. Wolfe, Mrs. Fougere." Back to her: "They think I killed Bonny, but I didn’t, <==

 and Mr. Wolfe is going to - uh - investigate. That’s a swell word, that is - ’investigate.’ There’s nothing you can do, Rita, absolutely nothing, but I - you’re a real friend."
She started a hand to touch him but let it drop. "I’ll wait for you," she said. "I’ll be outside."
"If you please." It was Wolfe. His eyes were at the client. "You have a chore, Mr. Kirk. I need to know if that article is among your belongings in your room, and you will please go and find out and phone me. Meanwhile I’ll talk with Mrs. Fougere. If you will, madam? I’m working for Mr. Kirk."
"Why ..." She looked at Kirk. Those eyes. "If he’s working for you..."

"Martin?"
"Yes. Rita?"
"Yes. Where are you?"
"In my room at the hotel. You’re still there?"
"Yes. What are you going to do? Are you going to your office?"
==> "Good Lord no. I’m going to see Jimmy Vance. Then I’m going to see Nero Wolfe again. Someone has - " <==
I cut in. "Hold it. I’ve told Mr. Wolfe and he’ll have instructions. Hold the wire." I turned. "He says he’s going to see Vance. Shall I tell him to lay off or will you?"
"Neither. He’s had no sleep and not much to eat. Tell him to come this evening, say nine o’clock, if he’s awake, and report on his talk with Mr. Vance."
"You tell him," I said and hung up. Being a salaried employee, I should of course keep my place in the presence of company, and that’s exactly what I was doing, keeping my place. I had had enough and then some, and Wolfe’s glare, which of course came automatically, was wasted because my head was turned and he had my profile, including the set of my jaw. When Rita was through with the phone he took it, spoke briefly with his client, cradled it, and looked at the clock. Six minutes to lunch.

Do you want me any more?" she asked him. "I’d like to go." "Later perhaps," he said. "If you’ll phone a little after six?"

WHEN YOU’RE GOOD and sore at someone it’s simple. You cuss him out, to his face if he’s available and privately if he isn’t, and you take steps if and as you can. When you’re sore at yourself it’s even simpler; the subject is right there and can’t skip. But when you’re sore at yourself and someone else at the same time you’re in a fix. If you try to concentrate on one the other one horns in and gets you off balance, and that was the state I was in as I stood aside in the vestibule of Two-nineteen Horn Street while Rita Fougere used her key on the door. In the taxi on the way down I had told her about the necktie problem. She might as well get it from me as later from Kirk, and she might as well understand why Kirk wanted to see Vance.
I supposed she would want to go first to her own apartment on the ground floor; surely any woman would whose face needed attention as much as hers - but no. Straight to the elevator and up, and out at the third floor, and she pressed the button at Vance’s door. It opened, and Vance was there. His face wasn’t as neat and smooth as it had been the day before, and he had on a different outfit - a conservative gray suit, a white shirt, and a plain gray tie. Of course the DA’s office had had him down too. He said "Rita!" and put out a hand, then saw me, but I can’t say what kind of a welcome I would have got because Kirk interrupted, stepping over and telling Rita she shouldn’t have come. She said something, but he wasn’t listening because he had noticed me.
==> "I’m glad you’re here," he said. "It’s not very clear in my mind, what Nero Wolfe told me about the tie. I was just going to tell Vance about him. Rita, please! You can’t - this is my trouble." <==
"Listen, Martin," she said, "you shouldn’t be here. I know now why they think it was one of us, so it’s our trouble. You should leave it to him - Nero Wolfe. You shouldn’t be talking about it with anybody, not even me. Isn’t that right, Mr. Goodwin?"
"Mr. Wolfe knew he was coming," I said. I have mentioned that I was sore. "Mr. Wolfe has been called a wizard by various people, and with a wizard you never know. Of course he had me come." I had to force my tongue to let that through, but a private scrap should be kept private.
Vance was frowning at me. "Nero Wolfe had you come? Here?"

A bell tinkled. I was between Vance and the door, and I moved to let him by. He opened the door and a man stepped in, darted a glance around, and squeaked, "What, a party? A hell of a time for a party, Jimmy."
I say he squeaked because he did, but it was obviously his natural squeak, not the kind on the phone that had told me to burn the tie, though it didn’t fit his six feet and broad shoulders and handsome, manly face. "It’s no party, Paul," Vance told him, but Paul ignored him and was at Rita. "My pet, you’re a perfect fright. You look godawful." He wheeled to Kirk. "And look at you, Martin my boy. Only why not? Why are you still loose?" He looked at me. "Are you a cop?"

That’s true love. Martin the Great had hit him, so he must be in a bad way. It

 would have been a shame to tell her it had been just pecks. I said no, he’d probably make it, and went to help Kirk examine his knuckles. They weren’t so bad.
"Why didn’t you stop them?" Vance demanded.
"I thought I did," I said. "With a mauler like Kirk you have to time it."
==> "I wouldn’t have thought..." He let it go. "Did you say he went to Nero Wolfe?" <==
"No, he did. But I can confirm it, I was present. He has hired Nero Wolfe. That’s why I’m here. I am collecting information that will establish the innocence of Mr. Wolfe’s client. Have you got any?"
"I’m afraid I haven’t." He was frowning. "But of course he is innocent. What Paul Fougere said, that’s ridiculous. I hope he didn’t tell the police that. But with their experience, I don’t suppose - "
The bell tinkled. Vance went to the door and opened it, and in came the law. Anyone with half an eye would know it was the law even if they had never seen or heard of Sergeant Purley Stebbins. Two steps in he stopped for a look and saw me.
"Yeah," he said, "I thought so. You and Wolfe are going to be good and sick of this one. I hope you try to hang on." His eyes went right. Fougere had appeared at the rear of the room. "Everybody, huh? I’m sorry to interrupt, Mr. Vance."
He moved. "You’re wanted downtown for more questions, Mr. Kirk. I’ll take you."

"Okay. We want you to identify the one you traded in. Come along."

 "Are you arresting me?"
"If you prefer it that way I can. Material witness. Or if you balk I’ll phone for a warrant and keep you company till it comes, maybe an hour. With Goodwin here I’ve got to toe the line. He’s hell on wheels, Goodwin is."
Kirk made it to his feet. "All right," he mumbled. He had been without sleep for thirty hours and maybe more. Rita Fougere aimed those eyes at me.
==> I bowed out. Being hell on wheels is fine and dandy if you have anywhere to steer for, but I hadn’t. I went and opened the door and on out, took the elevator down, exchanged no greeting with the driver of the police car out front, though we had met, walked till I found a taxi, and told the hackie 618 West 35th Street; and when he said that was Nero Wolfe’s house I actually said such is fame. That’s the shape I was in. <==
Wolfe was at table in the dining room, putting a gob of his favorite cheese on a wafer. When I entered he looked up and said politely, "Fritz is keeping the kidneys warm."
I stopped three steps in. "Many thanks," I said even more politely. "You were right as usual; the conversation was futile. They had a tail on Kirk, here and to the hotel and on to Horn Street. When Purley Stebbins arrived at Vance’s apartment he knew Kirk was there and he wasn’t surprised to see me. He had come for your client and took him. They have found the typewriter that addressed that envelope to me and the message. It belonged to Kirk, but on July nineteenth he traded it in on another one. Since you don’t talk business at meals, I’ll eat in the kitchen."
I wheeled, hell on wheels, and went to the kitchen.
87
NEARLY FOUR HOURS LATER, at six o’clock, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Fougere were in the office, waiting for Wolfe to come down from the plant rooms - she in the red leather chair and he in one of the yellow ones in front of Wolfe’s desk. To my surprise he had two marks, a red slightly puffed nose and a little bruise under his left eye. I hadn’t thought Kirk had shown that much power, but of course with bare knuckles it doesn’t take much.

Cut. I hadn’t expected him to open up, since he is as pigheaded as I am steadfast, but he could have made some little comment. As I looked up the Fougere number and dialed it, I was actually considering something I had never done and thought I never would: retract, apologize, and ask him please to tell me, as a favor to an old associate and loyal assistant, what the hell was in his mind, if anything. But of course I didn’t. When I hung up after getting no answer from the Fougere number, I had an idea: I would ask him if he wanted me to phone Parker. With a client collared as a material witness and probably headed for the coop on a murder charge, it should be not only routine but automatic for him to

 get Parker. But I looked at his face as he sat, comfortable, his eyes on the book, and vetoed it. He would merely say no and go on reading. It would have improved my feelings to pick up something and throw it at him, but not the situation, so I arose, went to the hall and up two flights to my room, stood at the window, and reviewed the past thirty hours, trying to spot the catch I had missed, granting there had been one. The trouble was I was sore. You can work when you’re sore, or eat or sleep or fight, but you can’t think straight.
My next sight of Wolfe was at two minutes past six when the elevator brought him down from the plant rooms and he entered the office. The slander approach had got results. The fifth time I tried the Fougere number, a little after four, Paul had answered, and I poured it on. On the phone his squeak sounded more like the one that had told me to burn the tie, but of course it would. A voice on a phone, unless it’s one you know well, is tricky. He said he’d come. An hour later Rita phoned. She was too frantic to be practical. She wanted to know if we had heard from Kirk, and were we doing anything and if so what, and shouldn’t Kirk have a lawyer. Being sore, I told her Wolfe was responsible to his client, not to her, that Kirk would of course need a lawyer, if and when he was charged with something, and that we were expecting her husband at six o’clock. When she said she knew that and she was coming along, I said she might as well have saved the dime. I am rude to people only when I am being rude to myself, or they have asked for it. I admit she hadn’t asked for it.
For Wolfe, being rude is no problem at all. When he entered he detoured around the red leather chair to his desk, gave Rita a nod, sat, narrowed his eyes at the husband, and snapped, "You’re Paul Fougere?"
==> It’s hard to snap back with a squeak, but Fougere did the best he could with what he had. "You’re Nero Wolfe?" <==
"I am. Did you kill that woman?"
I had known when I let them in that Fougere had decided on his line. It’s easy to see when a man’s all set. So the unexpected question flustered him. "You know damn well I didn’t," he said. "You know who did, or you ought to."
"Possibly I don’t. Do you?"
Fougere looked at his wife, at me, and back at Wolfe. He was adjusting. "You’d like that, wouldn’t you?" he said. "With witnesses. All right, I can’t prove it, and

Lily said it would depend, that she voted for Democrats only, in respect to the memory of her father. I arose to pour coffee, but Miss Brooke looked at her watch and said she had an appointment. Lily gestured toward the terrace and said it was a day to ignore appointments, but Miss Brooke said she couldn't, it was a meeting about a school boycott. She gave Lily a healthy thank-you handshake, but not me, which was proper, since I hadn't said definitely that I wasn't a Birchite. As Lily convoyed her to the foyer I filled my cup and took it to the glass doors to admire the weather.
Lily came to join me. "Quite a gal," she said. "Fighting her way through that to talk school boycott. If she's fascinating, it's lucky for me I'm not."
"It's one of your best points," I said, "that you're not fascinating." I put the cup on a plant stand.
"And that I'm rather selfish. Look me in the eye, Escamillo. Take that back about making you secure and happy and comfortable."
"Not me. I merely said a man." "Name one."
==> "Nero Wolfe." <==

Ha. What will you bet I couldn't?"
"Not a dime. I know him, but I know you too. No bet."
"You would have to move out." She had a look in her eye, I would say the look of a tiger stalking a herd of deer if I had ever seen a tiger stalk deer. "We would fire Fritz, and of course Theodore. He would read aloud to me. We would ditch the orchids and take out the partitions in the plant rooms and have dancing parties, and you wouldn't be invited. For lunch we would have peanutbutter-and- jelly sandwiches, and - "
I clapped a palm over her mouth with my other hand at the back of her head. With no effort to break away, she tried to bite. I said, "When you're ready to discuss the subject, shut your right eye."

She shut her right eye, and I took my hands away. "Well?" "I stand pat," she said. "She's fascinating."
"To you. It's perfectly simple. She's a status-seeker. She wants to be the mayor's wife."
"Uhuh. I always laugh at your cracks to make you secure and happy and comfortable, but may I skip that one? You're trying to get something on her that will keep that colored man from marrying her. Right?"
"That's the idea."
"Then two things. First, I don't think you'll get anything unless you invent it, and I know you wouldn't. I don't think there's anything to get - anything bad enough to count. Second, if there is, I hope you don't get it through anything you heard here. I couldn't blame you, but I would blame me. If she and that Negro want to get married they may be darned fools, of course I think they are, but it's their lookout. So do me a favor. If you stop it, and something you heard here got you started on what stops it, don't tell me. I don't want to know. That's me. You know?"
==> "Sure." I looked at my wrist: a quarter to three. "If I had any personal feelings about it they would be about the same as yours, but I haven't. Rights all over the place. She has a right to marry him. He has a right to marry her. The father and mother have a right to butt in, they've been doing it for ten thousand years. Nero <==

 Wolfe has a right to meet an obligation to a man. I have a right to earn my pay by doing what I'm told, providing it doesn't clash with my right to stay out of jail. So I'll run along and drop in at the office of the Parthenon Press, which is only a few blocks from here."
"There won't be anyone there. Look at that snow. I can beat you at gin. Don't they send people home?"
I looked. "They might at that. May I use the phone?" She was right. I got an answer, but not from the switchboard girl. Some man told me that everybody had gone. When I hung up Lily called through an open door, "I'm in here. Come on. I have a right to win enough to pay for the lunch."
She did, about.

"Oh. So actually her only background in Racine was her childhood. Her father had Racine background, and how. He was the smartest real-estate operator in southern Wisconsin. He owned this building. The family still does. I'm afraid I can't help you much, Mr. Goodwin. If what you want is dirt, I know I can't."


I had intended to ask him if anything newsworthy had happened to Susan Brooke, or about her, in the summer or fall of 1959, but I didn't. She was the Globe's landlady, and they might be behind on the rent. So I told him I wasn't after dirt specifically, just the picture, whatever it was. He started asking questions about the ROOC and what people in New York thought about Rockefeller and Goldwater, and I answered them to be polite.
It was dark when I emerged to the sidewalk, and the wind would freeze anything that was bare. I went back to the hotel and up to my room, where I was expecting company at six-thirty. In Chicago I had called on a man who had traded professional errands with Wolfe now and then. According to him, there was only one in Racine that was any good, by name Otto Drucker, and he had phoned him and made an appointment for me. In my nice warm room I took off my shoes and stretched out on the bed, but soon got up again. After only two blocks of that zero wind I would have been asleep in three minutes.
==> He was punctual, only five minutes late. As I shook hands with him at the door I didn't let my surprise show. I would never have picked him for an operative; he would have looked right at home at the desk of an assistant vice-president of a bank, with his neat well-arranged face and his friendly careful eyes. When I turned from putting his coat and hat on the bed, he asked in a friendly careful voice, "And how is Mr. Nero Wolfe?" <==
He was almost certainly a distinguished citizen. It had never occurred to me that a private detective could get away with it. Not Nero Wolfe. He's a citizen, and he's distinguished, but a distinguished citizen, no.
It was a very pleasant evening. He liked the idea of eating in the room. When I said I would phone room service for a menu, he said it wasn't necessary because the only things they knew how to cook were roast beef, hashed brown potatoes, and apple pie. If I reported the whole evening for you, you wouldn't enjoy it as much as I did, because mostly we talked shop. Take tailing. He knew all the tricks I had ever heard of, and, because he had been working in Racine for twenty years and everybody knew him, he had had to invent some twists that even Saul Panzer would be glad to use.
But of course the point was Susan Brooke. I didn't mention her until after we had got acquainted and had finished with the meal, which was okay, and the dishes had been taken away. All I told him was that a client was considering taking her

 as a partner in an important project, that anything he could tell me about her would be strictly confidential, and that he would not be quoted. I would have been disappointed in him if he hadn't asked who the client was. He did. He would have been disappointed in me if I had told him. I didn't.

He took his pipe from his mouth and tilted his head back to look at the ceiling.

"No," I said.
He nodded. "Get Mr. Whipple."
Before turning to the phone I shot a glance at Cramer. Chin down, eyes narrowed, and lips tight, he was glued to Wolfe. He knows him fairly well too, and he suspected what was coming. It would have cramped Wolfe's style a little if Whipple hadn't been at home, but he was.
He answered the phone. I started to tell him that Mr. Wolfe wanted to speak to him, but Wolfe was at his phone and cut in.

==> "This is Nero Wolfe, Mr. Whipple. Can you hear me?" "Yes." <==
"I owe you an apology. You were right, and I was wrong. I have just learned that your son is being held on a charge of murder. I am convinced that the charge is unfounded. If you want my services on your son's behalf, I offer them without fee. My previous undertaking to discharge my obligation to you was fatuous; I should have said no. Now I say yes."
Silence. Then: "His lawyer phoned an hour ago that he would probably be home by eight o'clock."
"His lawyer was wrong. I have more accurate information. Do you accept my offer?"
"Yes. Of course. We'll pay all we can."
"You'll pay nothing. My self-esteem needs repairs. But there's a question: the approval of your son and his lawyer."

"When will I get the report?"
"I can't say. How long will it take, Archie?"
"It depends," I told him. "If you want it all, every word, say forty hours. Three days and evenings. I talked with many people about many things. If you want only what could possibly be relevant, ten or twelve hours should do it. The affidavit could cover it."
"Tomorrow afternoon," Cramer said. "By five o'clock." "Maybe, but no guarantee."
He regarded Wolfe, opened his mouth and closed it again, about-faced, and was going. Wolfe raised his voice to tell his back, "We are under arrest!"
==> "Balls," Cramer said without stopping. As I got up and went to the hall to see that he was outside when the door shut, I was thinking that you couldn't blame him for being rude. He was facing the fact that they were slapping the big one on a man that Nero Wolfe had decided to take on. I didn't offer to help him with his hat and coat; it wouldn't have been appreciated. When he was out and the door shut I stepped back in the office. Wolfe was back in his chair, looking sour. <==
I went to my desk and sat. "At least twelve hours," I said. "I might as well be in jail."
I swiveled, got out paper and carbons, and swung the typewriter around. "What are you doing?" he demanded.
"Starting that damn report."
"Why don't you badger me first?"
"Waste of time. Anyway, didn't I say no?"

 barked at you, "What did you do, what did you do," I thought to myself, so he didn't kill her. If he had killed her of course he would be putting on an act, but that act was just too good. Only a genius could be that good, and I've never seen any genius besides you. Then when he told me I knew who killed her. Then when he apologized to you. Do I have to go on?"
"No. It was manifest. He couldn't possibly have been dissembling. You're aware that the report is required not only for Mr. Cramer. I must have it."
"Sure. Proceeding as usual. Giving me a long, mean, extremely difficult job." I turned and got at the paper and carbons.

It took eleven hours plus, four hours Thursday evening and most of Friday. Thirty-two pages and the affidavit. That may seem slow, but for most of it I had no notes. At a quarter past four Friday afternoon I put it in an envelope with a label addressed to Inspector Cramer, took it to a notary public on Eighth Avenue to have the affidavit made official, and then, in a taxi, to Homicide South on 20th Street. I also took a taxi back. It was a nice sunny winter day for a walk, but the Gazette was on the stands and there was an item in it which I wanted to enjoy at leisure.
==> There had been interruptions. Whipple had phoned late Thursday evening to say that Oster, the lawyer, had been glad to hear that he would have Nero Wolfe's help and had approved on behalf of his client. At eight-thirty Friday morning, already at my desk, I was buzzed by Wolfe on the house phone from his room and instructed to call Lon Cohen and tell him that if he cared to send a reporter to 35th Street we would have an item that might be printable; and furthermore I was told to send the reporter up to the plant rooms if he came between nine and eleven. He came a little after ten, and Fritz took him up in the elevator. That wasn't unprecedented but it was out of the ordinary. It was too bad I couldn't tell Dunbar Whipple that, in the interest of a Negro, Wolfe was making an exception he had rarely made in the interest of any white man. I wondered then, and I still do, whether words had anything to do with it, knowing how he is about words. <==

s he had told me, discussing words one evening at the dinner table, negro means black in Spanish and nero means black in Italian. And he had been born in Montenegro, Black Mountain. Maybe something buried in him but not dead, in his cesspool and/or garden.
Of the other phone calls I need to report only one, shortly after lunch, from Oster, when it was arranged that he and Whipple would come at six o'clock for a conference.
In the cab returning from 20th Street I read the item three times. It was on page 3, with the headline: NERO WOLFE SITS IN. Not bad. About anyone else it would probably have been STEPS IN.
God knows he sits. It went:

==> Nero Wolfe, the well-known private detective, is working on the Susan Brooke murder case. <==
He announced today that he has been engaged by Harold R. Oster, attorney for Dunbar Whipple, who has been charged with the murder (see page 1), to investigate certain aspects of the affair.
According to the record, not one of Wolfe's clients has ever been convicted of murder.
Asked this morning by a Gazette reporter if he didn't feel that in this case he was endangering his record, he replied with a flat no. He said that he has good reason to believe that Dunbar Whipple is innocent, and he is confident that, working with Oster, he will be able to procure evidence that will clear him.
He declined to disclose his reasons for believing that Whipple is innocent or the nature of the evidence he expects to get. But for some people the mere fact that he is willing to have it known publicly that he is engaged in the defense of Whipple will be significant. Others will say that there is always a first time.
No picture of the well-known detective, though there were a dozen shots of him in the Gazette morgue. I'd have to write a letter to the editor.

"But he..." Whipple let it hang. "I think you should consider it, Harold. Isn't it reasonable, his wanting to see them and ask them questions? It isn't - "
"I have seen them and asked them questions! I know them! Come on! If we need a detective, there are others!"
"Not like him," Whipple said. "No, Harold. You're being hasty. If you don't want to ask them to come, all right, I will. I'm sure Tom Henchy will see that it's reasonable. He's a - "
"You do that, Paul, and you'll get another lawyer, you and Dunbar. I'm warning you. I'm telling you."
"You're being hasty, Harold." "I'm telling you!"
==> "You certainly are." Whipple's head was tilted back. I had his profile, and for the first time I saw in him the cocky college boy at Kanawha Spa years and years back. "I know you're a good lawyer, Harold, but I don't know if you're good enough to get Dunbar out of this trouble. I'm being frank, and I doubt it. If anybody can, Nero Wolfe can. If it has to be you or Nero Wolfe, I'll see Dunbar in the morning and tell him what I think, and he'll agree. I'm sure he will." His eyes went to Wolfe. "Mr. Wolfe, it's not only the impression you made on me long ago when I was a raw kid. I've followed your career. As far as I'm concerned, you're in charge." Back to Oster: "Don't go, Harold. Sit down." <==
Oster was chewing his lip. "It's ridiculous," he said. "I'm an attorney-at-law, a respected member of the bar. He's a - a gurnshoe."
"Mr. Oster," Wolfe said.

What?"
"I suggest that Mr. Whipple's extravagance should be ignored. Let's put it that the legal defense of Dunbar Whipple is in your hands, and the search for evidence to support that defense is in my hands. I knew we would clash, and we have. There are no casualties. Oblige me by sitting down. Naturally I expected, and expect, you to be present at the conference tomorrow evening. If you wish to object to anything I say or do, you have a tongue. You have indeed. I don't wonder that you tried to drum me out; I'm difficult, though not really impossible. If you wish to debate it with Mr. Whipple, you can do so later." He looked at the clock. "No doubt you have information for me, and suggestions, and in less than half an hour it will be dinnertime. If you and Mr. Whipple will dine with us, we'll have the evening for it. Wild duck with Vatel sauce - wine vinegar, egg yolk, tomato paste, butter, cream, salt and pepper, shallots, tarragon, chervil, and peppercorns. Is any of those distasteful to you?"

"Will you do so?"

Yes, of course."
"I've talked with Magnus," Oster said. "So have the police, naturally. You won't get anything conclusive, one way or the other."
Wolfe was swallowing beer. It was turning into a big beer night, three bottles instead of the usual one or two. He put the glass down and licked his lips. "There's always a chance of a hint, and Mr. Goodwin is good at hints. I can't say about you, but the police were surely satisfied to have it that Miss Brooke made that call, and I am not. If there's any - "
==> The phone rang, and I turned and got it. "Nero Wolfe's resi - " "Saul, Archie. I've got a slice of maybe bacon." <==
"We could use some. We have company. Hold it."
"Sure."
I pressed a button, rose, detoured around the chairs, passing only eight inches from Miss Tiger's shoulder, went to the kitchen, and got at the phone on my breakfast table.
"Goodwin speaking."
"You sound more like Lieutenant Rowcliff." "I do not. I don't stutter. Well?"

"It's past bedtime. Ask Saul to come at eleven. If Miss Kallman hasn't called by ten o'clock you should call her."
"Right. Do you want to see Magnus?" "No. You will."
Meaning he only did the tricky ones. He raised his book, and I started collecting glasses.
Miss Tiger's was still two-thirds full. Wasting good gin, Follansbee's.

==> A problem like Dolly Brooke's lie is plain ornery. Even if we could get the garage man to play along and he said it to her face, a big if, she could say that he was mistaken, it had been another evening, or that she had gone on a personal errand which she preferred to keep to herself; and if she had actually driven to 128th Street and killed Susan Brooke it wouldn't help any to let her know we had caught her in a lie just to show her how smart we were. You might like to know how Nero Wolfe would handle such a problem, but I can't tell you in this particular case because he didn't handle it at all. Luck did. The luck rang the doorbell of the old brownstone at five minutes to ten Tuesday morning. <==


But first William Magnus. Rae Kallman phoned while I was at my breakfast table in the kitchen, on my fourth homemade Creole pork sausage and my third Creole fritter. She had discovered that she had Magnus's phone number in a notebook at home, and she had called him early, to get him before he left. By now he had gone for a day at school. He would have no free time until four- thirty, and we could expect him a little before five. As I resumed with the sausage and fritters I considered the fact that Miss Kallman was cooperating beyond the call of duty; she had promised only to supply his address and phone number. Sometimes - not often, but it does happen - such a little detail has a point. Had she wanted to brief him, and if so, why? A corner of my mind was still considering it in the office as I opened the morning mail.
When luck rang the doorbell at 9:55 I didn't know it was luck, even after I went to the hall and saw him on the stoop. Peter Vaughn was merely the long and lanky specimen who was still trying to hang onto the notion that he had been going to marry Susan Brooke after she got rid of her kink. As a candidate for the tag, at least 100 to 1. But when I opened the door and saw him closer, it was obvious that something really sharp was biting him. His bony face looked even narrower, and he had to unclamp his jaw to speak, to say that he knew Wolfe wasn't available at that hour, but he would rather see me anyway. That was grease, or it wasn't. I took him to the office and moved a chair up to face mine. He sat, clamped his jaw again, and rubbed his eyes, which were red and puffy, first with his fingertips and then with the heels of his palms.
"I haven't slept for four nights," he said.

"Yes." A muscle at the side of his neck was twitching. "I suppose... All right. I admit I'm thinking of me. I lied to the police."
"If I had a dime for every lie I've told them I'd be on my yacht in the Caribbean. What is it you don't feel?"
"What?"
"You said, 'I don't feel,' and stopped."
"I don't - Oh. Yes. I don't feel that there's any question of loyalty. I don't owe them any loyalty. I said I'm thinking of me, and I am, but the trouble is I have a conscience. That's an old-fashioned word, and I'm not religious, but I don't know what else to call it. That's why I haven't been able to sleep. What I can't stand - You remember, when we were here Friday evening, we tried to get Wolfe to tell us why he thinks that man is innocent, and he wouldn't. I want you to tell me why. Confidentially. Just for me."
==> It was beginning to sound promising. What was eating him might be something we could use, and the odds had at least doubled that he wasn't it. I made an effort. "If it would get you some sleep," I said, "I wish I could tell you. But if I did, people would no longer call me straight. Dunbar Whipple is Nero Wolfe's client, and I work for Nero Wolfe. But look at it. You read that piece in the Gazette. Mr. Wolfe has never taken a murder suspect for a client if he thought there was any chance that he was guilty. He knows Whipple is innocent. So do I. The only way he can prove it is to get the murderer. That's all I can tell you or your conscience." <==
He kept trying to focus on me without blinking. "I can't stand it," he said, "and I

 don't intend to. An innocent man convicted of murder because I didn't have the guts..." He shut his eyes tight and jerked his head from side to side.
"Look," I said, "let's get down to cases. What did you lie to the police about?"
"About where I was. That evening. I lied to Wolfe too. I wasn't at the club all evening. I left right after dinner and was gone for more than two hours."

"I might steal on you. Let me toss one. Did Susan Brooke make a phone call at a quarter past five on Monday, March second?"
He leaned back and crossed his legs. His dark brown socks, with light brown stripes, had set him, or his old man, back four bucks. 'The trouble is," he said, "that when I am asked questions I get an irresistible itch to give trick answers. It's probably a neurosis, you'd better just let me tell it. The cop that tried me first, and the lawyer - what's his name, wait a minute, Oster, that's it - and the assistant district attorney, they all insisted on asking questions, and I'm afraid they got

 somewhat confused. I don't want to confuse you too. I wish you'd tell me who said that about always belonging wherever you are. Or wrote it."
"Damn it, I did. If anyone beat me to it, I don't know who or when or where. Tell me about Susan Brooke and the phone call."
==> "Sure. I'm enjoying this. Nero Wolfe's office." He looked around. "That's the biggest globe I ever saw. Nice rug. Books and books. I'd love to spend a week going through all those files. It would probably teach me more than a year at law school. Anyway, I'm going into politics. I'm going to be governor of New York" Having uncrossed his legs to look around, he crossed them again. "But you want to hear about Susan Brooke." <==
"That was the idea,"
"Did you know her?"
"No. I met her once. Five days before she died."
"I met her a year ago. She was a lovely little dame, but I'm going to wait until I'm thirty to marry. It was on account of her I got onto civil rights. I wanted to help her, and anyway, if you're in politics you're in civil rights whether you like it or not. I set up that meeting for her that day. I am now telling you."
He uncrossed his legs, and his face changed completely. He was working. "It was in a room across the hall from an office used by members of the faculty. There's a phone in the office, extension seven-nine-three, and I had arranged to use it from four-thirty on and pay for the calls. I'm disposing of that factor. Twelve local calls were made on that phone between four-thirty and six-thirty, and I made three of them. Two of my calls were to the ROCC, but neither of them was anywhere near a quarter past five. No record was kept at the switchboard of the numbers called or the exact times. Is that covered?"

"Trick answer. Yes."
"I expected about forty people, and at five o'clock about forty were there, students and three or four faculty members. Only a few were seated. It's a big room, and we were moving around, groups here and there. I didn't call the meeting to order until Susan came, and she was late. I don't know exactly what time she arrived, and apparently no one does. I was over by a window, talking

 with four or five students, and she came and said, 'Here I am, late as usual.' I looked at my watch. Twenty minutes past five. So there it is. To my knowledge, it's possible that she had used the phone across the hall, but did she? I don't know. I have asked around, and I haven't found anyone who does know. Questions."
"I wouldn't dream of asking a question. If I did, it wouldn't be about the phone call; you've wrapped that up. It would be about how long the meeting lasted and when did Susan leave and so on."
==> He grinned. "You know how to handle me. If you go into politics, you can be senator and I'll be governor. The meeting adjourned at six-thirty, but a few of us stuck around a little while. Susan and I left at six-forty. My car was in a nearby garage, and I drove her home. By 'home' I mean the address on Park Avenue where she lives with her mother. I didn't know about the apartment in Harlem. Of course I do now. Everybody does. To finish, we arrived a little after seven, say ten after. That, as they put it in questions, was the last time I saw her alive. Alive or dead. Why did Nero Wolfe decide that Whipple didn't kill her?" <==
I grinned. "You're inviting it."
"Sure. Let's hear it."
"Because he knows you did."
He shook his head. "That's not very good. Try another. What was my motive?"

"Because he knows you did."
He shook his head. "That's not very good. Try another. What was my motive?"
"You thought she was pregnant, thanks to you, and it would louse up your political career."
"That's a little better. Why wasn't I seen? My superb physique, my noble countenance, why wasn't I noticed there in the middle of Harlem?"
"Burnt cork."
==> He threw his head back and laughed. "Wonderful! You're all right. You be governor and I'll be senator. Does Nero Wolfe think he knows who killed her?" <==
Wolfe wouldn't be down from the plant rooms for nearly an hour, so I permitted him to stay and enjoy himself a while longer. Also he was now a candidate,

 though at the bottom of the list, since he had called Susan a lovely dame and implied that he might have married her if he hadn't had other ideas. Since he was deliberately planning to go into the roughest game on earth, politics, nothing was beyond or beneath him, even clubbing a lovely dame, if he had a good enough reason.
When he had gone I got busy at the typewriter. Wolfe had told Dolly Brooke that it was possible that the police would never know about her trip to Harlem, but it looked to me like very long odds, and it wouldn't hurt to have a record, made while it was fresh, of what had been said, both at her apartment and in the office. If withholding evidence got to be an issue, I would be in it as deep as he was. In the Bastille I would have plenty of time to write my memoirs, and it would be helpful to have notes if I could smuggle them in. I was banging away and had got to where Wolfe said, 'I made it as brief as possible,' by six o'clock, when he came. He went to his desk and sat, and didn't pick up his book, so I swiveled to face him.
"Mr. Magnus?" he asked.

I should have known better. As I sat at my breakfast table in the kitchen Wednesday morning, disposing of corn muffins and shirred eggs with sherry and chives, my eyes were on the Times propped on the rack, but they were sharing attention with my ears. If the house phone buzzed it would be Wolfe, in his room, to tell me to come up for instructions. I should have known better. His line

out getting answers to questions while brushing his teeth had been merely a way to sneak up on automation. I don't say he had never got an idea while brushing his teeth, but if so it was when we were on something urgent. There was nothing urgent about this. What the hell, Dunbar Whipple was safe and sound, getting three meals a day - though it would have been different if Wolfe had been eating the meals. That would have been urgent.
That Wednesday was about as unsatisfactory a day as I have ever spent, speaking professionally. Wolfe's taking time out from a job was nothing new, far from it, but always before I had had the satisfaction of poking him; as I said, that was one of my main functions. Now I couldn't. I was on record that nobody could do anything, and that day nobody did, for sure. The only action performed or word spoken that had anything to do with the case came around five o'clock when Wolfe was up in the plant rooms fiddling with the orchids. The phone rang, and I said aloud, "Automation again." I lifted the receiver.
==> "Nero Wolfe's office, Archie Goodwin speaking." <==
"This is Peter Vaughn. I'm calling now because I knew Wolfe wouldn't be there. I can't take him."
"Neither can I. Today. Are you up and dressed?"
"Sure. I slept seventeen hours. I wanted to know, have you seen her?"
"Yes, and so has Mr. Wolfe. She spent an hour here Yesterday afternoon. Relax. She admits it as you told it. Naturally you want to know if we have passed it on. We haven't. For the present we're saving it. I wouldn't advise you to drop in on her for tea. She'd probably put vinegar in it, or something worse. By the way, I meant to ask you yesterday, have you ever heard her do imitations? People's voices?"
"Yes, often. She's good at it. She was on the stage, you know."

Maybe I seldom crow, and I'm all for self-esteem, but I have some flaws, and one of them showed when I walked into the office of the ROCC and crossed over to Maud Jordan at the switchboard and asked, "What time did Peter Vaughn get here yesterday morning?" That had been my suggestion to Wolfe just before Paul Whipple rang the doorbell, and using it verbatim appealed to one of my flaws, I'm not sure which one.
It wasn't answered. She looked down her long thin nose at me and asked, "Whom do you wish to see?"
I didn't press her, since Whipple had made it unnecessary. I told her Mr. Henchy, and it was urgent. She used the phone and told me to go on in, and as I went down the hall Harold R. Oster appeared in the doorway of the corner room. I would have preferred to have Henchy alone because lawyers always complicate things, but didn't make an issue of it. He didn't offer a hand, and neither did Henchy when Oster nodded me in and closed the door. Neither of them nodded me to a chair.
==> I said, standing, to Henchy at his desk, "Paul Whipple has told Nero Wolfe - not on the phone, in person - what he told you he would, about Peter Vaughn, and Mr. Wolfe wants to see you. Now. Everybody who spoke with Vaughn yesterday." <==
"Sit down," Oster said.
"I'd just have to get up again to go with you. You realize it's urgent. There's no telling how soon the cops will get here, and then you won't be available. If no one here knows where you've gone you won't be available to them for a while. If you think I'm pushing, I am."
Henchy started, "You certainly - " but Oster cut in, "I'll handle it, Tom. Keep your shirt on, Goodwin. If and when the police learn that Vaughn came here yesterday, we'll answer any questions they may care to ask. He merely wanted to inquire about Dunbar Whipple and Susan Brooke, how intimate they had been. He insisted on it and he was a damned nuisance. Nothing he said or did here could possibly have any connection with his murder. Tell Wolfe I'll see him later, at six o'clock, when he's available."

He's available now." I focused on Henchy. "All right, I'll mention something that Mr. Wolfe would have preferred to mention himself, but it doesn't matter. Vaughn called me on the phone at ten minutes past five yesterday afternoon and said something that makes it extremely probable that he was murdered because of something that happened when he was here. Not only do Mr. Wolfe and I assume that, the cops do too."

"I'm sorry." "Archie?" "Sorry and sad."
He glared. "Two highly trained and highly skilled men, and what good are you? Go somewhere. Do something. Am I to sit here another evening, and go up to bed, contemplating frustration? Reflecting, in desperation, as I did day before yesterday on a diphthong?"
Saul and I exchanged glances. Our genius was going potty on us. To humor him I inquired, "A diphthong?"

Yes. Tenuous almost to nullity, it was unworthy of consideration. It still is. But I'm bereft, and it's a fact. Get Mr. Vaughn."
==> For half a second I thought he was worse than potty; then, realizing that there was a Mr. Vaughn who was still alive, and that diphthonp might be his hobby, I got at the phone. With his son not yet buried, Samuel Vaughn probably wouldn't be at Heron Manhattan, Inc., but I tried it on the chance, was told that he wasn't in today, and dialed his home number. He wasn't accessible until I made it clear that Nero Wolfe wanted to ask him a question - I didn't say about a diphthong - and in a couple of minutes I had him, and Wolfe took his phone. <==
"I presume to disturb you, Mr. Vaughn, only because I am concerned with the death of your son in connection with my investigation of the death of Susan Brooke, and I need a bit of information you may be able to supply. According to the published accounts, your son graduated from Harvard in nineteen fifty-nine. Is that correct?"
"Yes. Why do you ask?"
"To lead to the next question. I'd rather not elucidate now, but it's possible that this will be helpful in identifying a murderer. Do you know if your son was acquainted with a fellow student named Richard Ault? A-U-L-T. Perhaps a classmate?"
"I'm afraid I don't - Walt a minute... yes, I do. That was the name of the boy that committed suicide that summer, after they graduated. My son told me about it. Yes, he knew him rather well; they took the same courses. But I don't understand... what possible connection "
'There may be none. I f I find one, you'll understand then. Do you know if your son ever visited Richard Ault at his home - perhaps at vacation time?"

"I'd have to be back Monday morning for a little job," Saul said. "No, Archie will go. You're needed here. Archie, find - "
He stopped because I had turned to the phone and started dialing.

At ten minutes past two Friday morning I sat on a wooden chair at the end of a glasstopped desk in a room with two windows, being sized up by a cop. I wasn't exactly in the pink, after the day in New York, the plane ride to Louisville, and the three-hour drive in a rented car to Evansville, but since I now knew which diphthong it was, and I would sleep better after I got the answers to a few questions, and police headquarters is open all night, I had stopped at the hotel only long enough to sign in. I admit that as I sat I had to tell myself to keep my shoulders up.
The cop's name was Sievers, Lieutenant Sievers, an old pro with very little hair but plenty of jaw. He gave my New York State detective license a thorough look, handed it back, and frowned at me. "Archie Goodwin," he said. "Haven't I seen that name somewhere?"
==> "I hope not on a hot dodger. You may have seen the name of the man I work for, Nero Wolfe." <==
"Oh." He nodded. "That one. Yeah. How do you stand him?"
"I've asked myself that question a thousand times, and damned if I can answer it."
"Don't expect me to. What's your problem here?"
"Just a little information we need, about a man named Richard Ault, or I should

I stopped short. Wolfe asked, "What?"
"Nothing. But that's what you thought about the diphthong: it wasn't worth considering. What if she decided to get the mother too and picked tonight for it? That would be just great."
I swiveled. I didn't have Mrs. Matthew Brooke's number on the card and had to

 look in the book. I got it, and dialed, and sat and listened to fourteen buzzes, two more than my usual allowance. I don't dial wrong numbers, so I didn't try again but dialed another number, one that was on the card, and that time got an answer, a voice that I recognized, saying, "Mrs. Brooke's residence."
==> 'This is Archie Goodwin," I said, "at Nero Wolfe's office. Mr. Wolfe wants to ask Mrs. Matthew Brooke a question, and I just dialed her number and got no answer. I thought she might be with you. Is she?" <==
"No. What does he want to ask her?"
"Nothing very important, just a routine question, but it would help to have the answer now. Do you know where I can get her?"
"No, I don't. But it's odd...."
Silence. After five seconds of it I asked, "What's odd?" "I thought perhaps - Where are you?"
"Nero Wolfe's office."

"You did. I'm not surprised at Wolfe. With his ego, there's no one and nothing he wouldn't take on if you paid him. But I'm surprised at you. You know damn well the FBI can't be bucked. Not even by the White House. And you're hopping around pecking at people's scabs. You're asking for it and you'll get it. You're off "your" hinges."
I poured milk. "You're absolutely right," I said. "From any angle, you're dead right. An hour ago I would have said amen. But you know, I feel different about it now. Did I mention something Mr. Wolfe said last night? He said some sting

 may have stirred someone to action. All right, they were stung into needling Perazzo, and he was stung into calling the Commissioner, and he was stung into calling you, and you were stung into getting me here without company and treating me to a quart of milk, which is completely incredible. If one incredible thing can happen, so can another one. Will you answer a question?"
"Ask it."
==> "You don't exactly love Nero Wolfe, and you certainly don't love me. Why do you want to make a report to the Commissioner that will make it tough to take our licenses?" <==
"I haven't said I do."
"Nuts." I tapped the milk carton. "This says it. Getting me here the way you did says it. Why?"
He left the chair and moved. He tiptoed to the door, smooth and silent considering his age and bulk, jerked the door open, and stuck his head out. Evidently he wasn't as sure he was loose as I was that I was. He shut the door and went to the bathroom, and I heard water spurting from a faucet, and in a minute he came with a glass of water. He drank it, in no hurry, put the glass on the table, sat, and narrowed his eyes at me.
"I've been a cop for thirty-six years," he said, "and this is the first time I've ever passed the buck to an outsider."
I had my eyes smile a little. "I'm flattered. Or Mr. Wolfe is."

VINCENT YARMACK, around 50, was another senior editor at "Tick-Tock". I include him because the piece by Althaus about the FBI had been his project.
It didn't look very promising for an approach. I considered the stage personality, but her whirl with Althaus had ended more than a year ago, and besides, a couple of previous experiences had taught me that actresses are better from the fifth or sixth row. The two editors would hang up. Father probably had nothing. Marian Hinckley would stiff-neck me. The best bet was mother, and it was her number I looked up and went to the booth to dial.
First, of course, to get her to the phone. To the female who answered I gave no name; I merely told her, in an official tone, to tell Mrs. Althaus that I was talking from a booth and an FBI man was with me and I must speak to her. It worked. In a couple of minutes another voice came.
"Who is this? An FBI man?" "Mrs. Althaus?"
"Yes."
==> "My name is Archie Goodwin. I'm not an FBI man. I work for Nero Wolfe, the private investigator. The FBI man is not here in the booth with me; he is with me because he is following me. Tailing me. He will follow me to your address, but that doesn't matter to me if it doesn't to you. I must see you - now, if possible. It will - " <==
"I am not seeing anybody."

know. You may have heard of Nero Wolfe. Have you?" "Yes."
"He has been told by a man he knows well that your son Morris was killed by an agent of the FBI. That's why I am being followed. And that's why I must see you. I can be there in ten minutes. Did you get my name? Archie Goodwin."
Silence. Finally: "You "know" who killed my son?"

"Who is this? An FBI man?" "Mrs. Althaus?"
"Yes."

"He has been told by a man he knows well that your son Morris was killed by an agent of the FBI. That's why I am being followed. And that's why I must see you. I can be there in ten minutes. Did you get my name? Archie Goodwin."
Silence. Finally: "You "know" who killed my son?"
"Not his name. I don't "know" anything. I only know what Mr. Wolfe has been told. That's all I can say on the phone. If I may make a suggestion, we think Miss Marian Hinckley should know about this too. Perhaps you could phone her and ask her to come, and I can tell both of you. Could you?"
"I could, yes. Are you a newspaper reporter? Is this a trick?"
"No. If I were this would be pretty dumb, you'd only have me bounced. I'm Archie Goodwin."

I waited a little, then said, "Yes, Mrs. Althaus?"
"I see no reason why I shouldn't tell you. I have suspected it was the FBI, ever since Mr. Yarmack told me that nothing about them was found in the apartment. So has Mr. Yarmack, and so has Miss Hinckley. I don't think I am a vindictive woman, Mr. Goodwin, but he was my - " Her voice was going to quiver, and she stopped. In a moment she went on. "He was my son. I am still trying to realize that he - he's gone. Did you know him? Did you ever meet him?"
"No."
"You're a detective." "Yes."
"You're expecting me to help you find - to fix the blame for my son's death. Very well, I want to. But I don't think I can. He rarely spoke to me about his work. I don't remember that he ever mentioned the FBI. Miss Hinckley has asked me that, and Mr. Yarmack. I'm sorry I can't tell you anything about it, I'm truly sorry, because if they killed him I hope they will be punished. It says in Leviticus 'Thou shalt not avenge', but Aristotle wrote that revenge is just. You see, I have been thinking about it. I believe - "
==> She turned to face the arch. A door had closed, and there were voices, and then a girl appeared. As she approached I got up, but Mrs. Althaus kept her chair. The pictures in the "Gazette" file understated it. Marian Hinckley was a dish. She was an in-between, neither blonde nor brunette, brown hair and blue eyes, and she moved straight and smooth. If she wore a hat she had ditched it in the foyer. She came and gave Mrs. Althaus a cheek kiss, then turned to look at me as Mrs Althaus pronounced my name. As the blue eyes took me in I instructed mine to ignore any aspect of the situation that was irrelevant to the job. When Mrs. Althaus invited her to sit I moved a chair up. As she sat she spoke to Mrs. Althaus. "If I understood you on the phone - did you say Nero Wolfe knows it was the FBI? Was that it?" <==


"I'm afraid I didn't get it straight," Mrs. Althaus said. "Will you tell her, Mr. Goodwin?"
I described it, the three points: why Wolfe was interested, what had made him suspicious, and how his suspicion had been supported by what a man told him yesterday. I explained that he didn't "know" it was the FBI, and he certainly couldn't prove it, but he intended to try to and that was why I was there.
Miss Hinckley was frowning at me. "But I don't see... Has he told the police what the man told him?"

"Does Mr. Yarmack know?"
"I don't know. I don't think so."
"How do you feel about it, Miss Hinckley? Whoever killed Morris Althaus, do you want him caught? Caught and dealt with?"

Of course I do. Certainly I do."
==> I turned to Mrs. Althaus. "You do too. All right, it's a good bet that he never "will" be caught unless Nero Wolfe does it. You may know that he doesn't go to see people. You'll have to go to him, to his house - you and Miss Hinckley, and, if possible, Mr. Yarmack. Can you be there this evening at nine o'clock?" <==
"Why..." She had her hands clasped. "I don't... What good would it do? There's nothing I can tell him."
"There might be. I often think there's nothing "I" can tell him, but I find out I'm wrong. Or if he only decides that none of you can tell him anything, that will help. Will you come?"
"I suppose..." She looked at the girl who had been expecting to be her daughter- in-law.
"Yes," Miss Hinckley said. "I'll go."
I could have hugged her. It would have been relevant to the job. I asked her, "Could you bring Mr. Yarmack?"

I raised a finger. "Your guess that they might have hit on the FBI theory at the "Gazette", and be working on it, wasn't so good." I lowered the finger. "Lon Cohen didn't mention it, so I didn't. They haven't got a theory. He let me go through the files, and we talked, and I got a dozen pages of names and assorted details, some of which might possibly be useful." I raised a finger. "I'll type it up at the usual five dollars a page." I lowered the finger. "Next I phoned Mrs. David Althaus from a booth, and she said she would see me, and I went. Park Avenue in the Eighties, tenth-floor apartment, all the trimmings you would expect.

 Pictures okay. I won't describe her because you'll see her. She quotes Leviticus and Aristotle." Finger raised. "I wanted to quote Plato but couldn't work it in." Finger lowered. "I had asked her on the phone to ask Marian Hinckley to come, and she said she would be there soon. She said she had understood me to say on the phone that her son had been killed by an agent of the FBI and was that correct. From there on you had better have it verbatim."
I gave it to him, straight through, knowing that I had said nothing we wouldn't be willing for the FBI to hear. Leaning back with his eyes closed, he wouldn't have been able to see a raised finger, so I couldn't make any insertions. When I finished he grunted, opened his eyes, and said, "It's bad enough when you know there's a needle in the haystack. When you don't even - "
The doorbell rang. Going to the hall for a look, I saw a G-man on the stoop. Not that I recognized him, but it must be - the right age, the broad shoulders, the manly mug with a firm jaw, the neat dark gray coat. I went and opened the door the two inches allowed by the chain bolt and said, "Yes, sir?"
==> He blurted through the crack, "My name's Quayle and I want to see Nero Wolfe!" <==
"Spell it, please?"
"Timothy Quayle! Q,U,A,Y,L,E!" "Mr. Wolfe is engaged. I'll see."
I went to the office door. "One of the names in my notebook. Timothy Quayle. Senior editor at "Tick-Tock" magazine. The hero type. He slugged a reporter who was annoying Marian Hinckley. She must have phoned him about you soon after I left."
"No," he growled.
"It's half an hour till dinner. Are you in the middle of a chapter?" He glowered at me. "Bring him."

Some realty agency branch offices are upstairs, but that one was on the ground floor of an apartment building, of course one of the buildings it serviced. I entered. It was small, two desks and a table and a filing cabinet. A beautiful young lady with enough black hair for a Beatle was at the nearest desk, and when she smiled at me and asked if she could help me, I had to take a breath to keep my head from swimming. They should stay home during business hours. I told her I would like to see Mr. Odell, and she turned her beautiful head and nodded to the rear.
He was at the other desk. I had waited to see him before deciding on the approach, and one look was enough. Some men, after a hitch in the jug, even a short one, have got a permanent wilt, but not him. In size he was a peanut, but an elegant peanut. Fair-skinned and fair-haired, he was more than fair-dressed. His pin-stripe gray suit had set him, or somebody, back at least two Cs.
He left his chair to come, said he was Frank Odell, and offered a hand. It would have been simpler if he had had a room to himself; possibly she didn't know she was cooped up with a jailbird. I said I was Archie Goodwin, got out my case, and handed him a card. He gave it a good look, stuck it in his pocket, and said, "My goodness, I should have recognized you. From your picture in the paper."
==> My picture hadn't been in the paper for fourteen months, and he had been behind bars, but I didn't make an issue of it. "I'm beginning to show my years," I told him. "Can you give me a few minutes? Nero Wolfe has taken on a little job involving a man named Morris Althaus and he thinks you might be able to furnish some information." <==
He didn't bat an eye. No wilt. He merely said, "That's the man that was murdered."
"Right. Of course the police have been around about that. Routine. This is just a private investigation on a side issue."
"If you mean the police have been "here", they haven't. We might as well sit down." He moved to his desk, and I followed and took a chair at its end. "What's the side issue?" he asked.
"It's a little complicated. It's about some research he was doing at the time he was killed. You may know something about it if you saw him during that period

She had put the glass on the table. "But what is there to ask me?"
"Just questions. For instance, about Morris Althaus. How well did you know him?"
"I didn't know him at all."
"He came at least once to your house - your office. According to Odell."
She nodded. "That's right, he did. I remembered that when I read about him - the murder." Her chin was up. "I don't like your tone, Mr. Goodwin. Are you intimating that I have concealed something?"
==> "Yes, Mrs. Bruner, I am. That you "may" have. We might as well clear it up before lunch instead of after. You have hired Mr. Wolfe to do a job that's as close to impossible as a job can get. The least you can do is tell us everything that could conceivably have a bearing on it. The fact that you had known Morris Althaus, at least you had met him, naturally suggests questions. Did you know he was working at a piece on the FBI? Let me finish. Did you know or suspect that the FBI was involved in his murder? Was that why you sent those books? Was that why you came to Nero Wolfe? Just stay in the buggy. We simply have to know everything you know, that's all." <==
She did all right. A woman who can toss you a check for a hundred grand without blinking hasn't had much practice listening to reason from a hireling, but she managed it. She didn't count ten, at least not audibly, but she picked up her glass and drank, gave me a straight look, put the glass down, and spoke. "I didn't 'conceal' anything. It just didn't occur to me to mention Morris Althaus. Or perhaps it did occur to me while I was thinking about it, but not while I was talking to Mr. Wolfe. Because it was just - I didn't really "know" anything. I don't know anything now. I had read about the murder and remembered that I had met him, but the only connection it had with the FBI was what Miss Dacos, my secretary, had told me, and that was just a girl talking. She didn't really

 "know" anything either. It had nothing to do with my sending the books. I sent them because I had read it, and I thought it was important for important people to read it. Does that answer your questions?"
"Pretty well, but it raises another one. Just keep in mind that I'm working on your job. What had Miss Dacos told you?"
"Nothing but talk. She lived at the same address, she still does. Her - " "What same address?"

"Nothing but talk. She lived at the same address, she still does. Her - " "What same address?"
"The same as that man, Morris Aithaus. In the Village. Her apartment is on the second floor, below his. She was out that evening, and soon after - "
"The night he was killed?"
"Yes. Stop interrupting me. Soon after she returned to her apartment she heard footsteps outside, people going down the stairs, and she was curious about who it might be. She went to the window and looked out and saw three men leave the house and walk to the corner, and she thought they were FBI men. The only reason she had for thinking they were FBI men was that they looked like it; she said they were 'the type.' As I said, she didn't "know" anything, and I didn't know there was any connection between Morris Althaus and the FBI. You asked if I knew he was working on a piece on the FBI. No, not until you told me. I resent your suggestion that I concealed something." She looked at her wristwatch. "It's after one o'clock, and I have an appointment at half past two, a committee meeting that I must be on time for."
I pushed a button, two shorts, on a slab on the table, and begged her pardon for asking her to lunch and then starving her. In a couple of minutes Pierre came with the lobster bisque, and I told him to bring the squabs in ten minutes without waiting for a ring.
==> There was a little question of etiquette. As a matter of business it would have been proper to tell her that neither Nero Wolfe nor I was ever allowed to pay for anything we or our guests ate at Rusterman's, so it wouldn't be an item on the expense account, but such a remark didn't seem to fit with Squabs "a la Moscovite", Mushrooms "Polonaise", "Salade Beatrice", and "Souffle Armenonville". I vetoed it. I didn't resume on Miss Dacos, but our only known common interest was the FBI. I learned that she had received 607 letters <==

 thanking her for the book, most of them just a polite sentence or two; 184 disapproving letters, some pretty strong; and 29 anonymous letters and cards calling her names. I was surprised that it was only 29; out of the 10,000 there must have been a couple of hundred members of the John Birch Society and similar outfits.
With the coffee I returned to Miss Dacos, having done some calculating. If Wolfe left Hewitt's at four o'clock he would get back around five-thirty, but he might leave later, say five, and arrive at six-thirty, in need of refreshment after the dangerous trip in the dark of night surrounded by thousands of treacherous machines. It would have to be after dinner. When Pierre left after serving coffee I told Mrs. Bruner, "Of course Mr. Wolfe will have to see Miss Dacos. She may know nothing, as you say, but he'll have to satisfy himself on that. Will you tell her to be here at nine o'clock this evening? In this room. Our office may be bugged."
"But I told you it was just a girl talking."
I said she was probably right, but one of Wolfe's specialties was prying something useful out of people who just talk, and when she finished her coffee I took her to Felix's office in the rear, and she got Miss Dacos on the phone and arranged it.

I dialed the number I knew best and told Fritz we would dine at Rusterman's and he would have to leave the venison chops in the marinade until tomorrow. Then I got Mrs. David Althaus's number from the book and dialed it, but by the time she got on I had decided not to ask her on the phone. All I wanted to know was if she had ever heard her son mention a girl named Sarah Dacos, but I had three hours to kill, so I might as well take a walk. I asked if she would let me in if I came around four-thirty, and she said yes. On the way out I told Felix that Wolfe and I would be there for dinner.

I was back in the soundproofed room, on my fanny with my legs stretched out

 and my eyes focused on my toes, going over the mess for the tenth time, when Wolfe arrived at twenty minutes to seven, ushered in by Felix. Knowing that was the busiest time of day downstairs for Felix, I shooed him out and took Wolfe's coat and hung it up and said I hoped he had had an interesting trip.
==> He growled and went and sat in the armchair which Marko Vukcic had bought years ago for his friend Nero's exclusive use. Between Wolfe's visits it is kept in the room that was Marko's personal den. "I have decided," he said, "that every man alive today is half idiot and half hero. Only heroes could survive in the maelstrom, and only idiots would want to." <==
"It's tough in spots," I conceded, "but you'll feel better after you eat. Felix has woodcock."
"I know he has." He glared. "You enjoy it."
"I have up to now. Now, I'm not so sure. How about Hewitt?"
"Confound it, he enjoys it too. Everything is arranged. Saul was very helpful, as he always is. Satisfactory."
I went and took a chair. "My report may not be satisfactory, but it has its points. To begin at the end, Mrs. Althaus says that she never heard her son mention Sarah Dacos."

I nodded. "You're not only bored, your connections are jammed. You said we prefer by far the second alternative, so we certainly want to know if there is any chance of getting it. Sarah Dacos was there in the house, if not when he was shot, soon after. It's possible she can settle it, one way or the other. If you want - "
The door opened, and Pierre entered with a loaded tray. I glanced at my watch: 7:15. So he had told Felix a quarter past seven; by gum, he was hanging on to one rule at least, and he would certainly hang on to another one, no business talk at the table. He got up and left the room to wash his hands. By the time he got back Pierre had the mussels served and was waiting to hold his chair. He sat, forked a mussel to his mouth, used his tongue and teeth on it, swallowed, nodded, and said, "Mr. Hewitt has bloomed four crosses between "Miltonia sanderae" and "Odontoglossum pyramus". One of them is worth naming."
So they had found time to visit the orchid house.
Around half past eight Felix came and asked if he could have a minute to discuss the problem of shipping "langoustes" from France by air. It developed that what he really wanted was Wolfe's approval of frozen "langoustes", and of course he didn't get it. But he was stubborn, and they were still at it when Pierre ushered Sarah Dacos in. She was right on time. As I took her coat she accepted my offer of coffee, so I put her in a chair at the table and waited until Felix had gone to tell Wolfe her name.
He sizes a man up, but not a woman, because of his conviction that any opinion formed of any woman is sure to be wrong. He looked at Sarah Dacos, of course, since he was to talk to her. He told her that he supposed Mrs. Bruner had told her of her conversation with me.
==> She wasn't as chipper as she had been in her office; the hazel eyes weren't so lively. Mrs. Bruner had said that she had just talked; perhaps, sent to tell Nero Wolfe about it, she was feeling that she had just talked too much. She said yes, Mrs. Bruner had told her. <==
Wolfe blinked at her. The light there wasn't like the office, and besides, his eyes had had a hard day. "My interest is centered on Morris Althaus," he said. "Did

 you know him well?"
She shook her head. "Not really, no. "You lived under the same roof."
"Well... that doesn't mean anything in New York, you know that. I moved there about a year ago, and when we met in the hall one day we realized we had met before - at Mrs. Bruner's office, the day he was there with that man, Odell. After that we had dinner together sometimes - maybe twice a month."

"The hell we haven't. We have someone who had some reason for thinking they were G-men and is saving it. That will be pie for Cramer."
"No. It's our pie. We'll give Mr. Cramer Miss Dacos only when we have her ourselves, if at all." He pushed his chair back. "Get it out of her. Tomorrow. I'm tired. We're going home and to bed."
10
At 10:35 Saturday morning I used a key on the door of 63 Arbor Street, ascended two flights of wooden stairs, used another key, and entered the apartment that had been Morris Althaus's.
I was following my own approach to the problem of getting it out of Sarah Dacos. I admit it was roundabout, especially in view of the fact that time was short, but it was a better stab at getting results than persuading her to go to the Flamingo for an evening of dancing. The fact that time was short had been made publicly evident by an item on the twenty-eighth page of the morning paper, which I had read at my breakfast table in the kitchen. It was headlined FINGERS CROSSED? and said:
==> The members of the Ten for Aristology, one of the most exclusive of New York's gourmet groups, evidently do not believe that history repeats itself. Lewis Hewitt, capitalist, socialite, orchid fancier, and aristologist, will entertain the group at dinner at his home at North Cove, Long Island, on Thursday evening, January 14. The menu will be chosen by Nero Wolfe, the well-known private investigator, and the food will be prepared by Fritz Brermer, Mr. Wolfe's chef. Mr. Wolfe and Archie Goodwin, his confidential assistant, will be present as guests. <==
That arrangement arouses memory of another occasion when Mr. Brenner cooked a dinner for the Ten for Aristology, and Mr. Wolfe and Mr. Goodwin were guests, at the home of Benjamin Schriver, the shipping magnate. It occurred on April 1, 1958, and one of the Ten, Vincent Pyle, head of a Wall Street brokerage firm, was poisoned with arsenic in his portion of the first course, served to him by Carol Annis, who was subsequently convicted of first- degree murder.


Yesterday a "Times" reporter, remembering that former occasion, telephoned Mr. Hewitt and asked him if any of the Ten for Aristology (aristology means science of dining) had shown any reluctance to attend the affair next Thursday, and Mr. Hewitt said no. When the reporter asked him if he would keep his fingers crossed he said, "How can I? I couldn't handle my knife and fork."
It will certainly be an excellent meal.

"Sure. Scientists can do it now even if the number has been filed off. And Cramer will have the number of the one Althaus had a permit for."
"Then there will be no problem. I must see about that sturgeon." He left his chair and headed for the door. Short of it he stopped and turned, said, "Satisfactory," and went. I shook my head and went on shaking it as I replaced the yellow chair. "There will be no problem," for God's sake. I thought if I had an ego that size I'd be the boss of the FBI, and then realized that that wasn't exactly the way to put it. I returned the keys and gloves to the cabinet, went to the kitchen to get a glass of milk, since lunch would be late, and to listen to them discuss sturgeon.
With a couple of hours to go, possibly more, after the milk was down I made the rounds - first two flights up to my room, to see that everything was in order for the guests who would occupy my bed. Fritz isn't supposed to touch my room; it's mine, including the responsibility. It was okay, except that the two pillows I had got from the closet that morning weren't the same size, but that couldn't be helped. Then to the South Room, which is above Wolfe's, where two more guests would sleep on the twin beds. That visit was unnecessary, since Fritz never makes mistakes, but I had time to kill.
It got killed somehow.
I wasn't expecting them until two at the earliest, but I should have known better, since Saul was in charge. Wolfe was in the kitchen and I was in the front room, which adjoins the office, checking that blankets were on the sofa, when the doorbell rang and I glanced at my watch. Twenty to two, so it couldn't be the truck.
==> But it was. Going to the hall, I saw a big bozo in a leather jacket on the stoop. When I opened the door he boomed at me, "Nero Wolfe? Orchids for you!" <==
I stepped out. At the curb was a big green truck with red lettering on its side: NORTH SHORE TRUCKING CORPORATION. Another big bozo was at its rear, opening the doors. I said fairly loud that it was pretty damn cold for orchids and I would come and help. By the time I got my coat on and went out they had

 a box on the edge at the back and were pulling it around. I happened to know its exact size - three feet wide, five feet long, and two feet high - because I had packed boxes exactly like it with orchid plants on their way to dealers or exhibitions. On its side it was marked:
FRAGILE PERISHABLE TROPICAL PLANTS
KEEP AS WARM AS POSSIBLE

They all said no, which suited me fine. I hate to poach eggs.
An hour later we were having a pleasant evening. The three guests and I were in the front room, in a tight game of pinochle, and Wolfe was in his one and only chair in the office, reading a book. The book was "The FBI Nobody Knows". He was either gloating or doing research, I didn't know which.
At ten o'clock I had to excuse myself from the card table briefly; Wolfe had said he wanted to call Hewitt then, when the aristologists would presumably have finished their meal. I went to the office and made the call. Wolfe told Hewitt it had worked perfectly and thanked him. Hewitt said they had found the standins very entertaining; Jarvis had recited passages from Shakespeare and Kirby had mimicked President Johnson and Barry Goldwater and Alfred Lunt. Wolfe said to give them his regards, and I went back to pinochle and Wolfe to his book.
But there was another interruption a little after eleven o'clock. The phone rang, and Wolfe hates to answer it, so I went and got it at my desk.

==> "Nero Wolfe's residence, Archie Goodwin speaking." <==
"This is Richard Wragg, Goodwin." The voice was a drawl, smooth and low- pitched. "I want to speak to Wolfe."
We had known that might happen, and I had instructions.
"I'm afraid you can't, Wragg. He's engaged."
"I want to see him."
"Good idea. He thought you might. Say here, his office, at eleven in the morning?"

At the kitchen end of the hall there is an alcove on the left, and around the corner in the alcove there is a hole in the wall at eye level. On the alcove side of the hole there is a sliding panel, and on the office side the hole is covered by a trick picture of a waterfall. If you stand in the alcove and open the panel you have a view of most of the office through the waterfall, and of course you can hear.
Taking Mrs. Bruner to the alcove, followed by Saul, I slid the panel and showed her the hole. "As I said," I told her, "Wragg is coming and will be in the office with Mr. Wolfe and me. Mr. Panzer will bring the stool from the kitchen, and you'll sit here on it, and he'll stand here. It will last anywhere from ten minutes to two hours, I don't know. You won't understand everything you hear, but you'll understand enough. If you feel a cough or sneeze coming, go to the kitchen fast on your toes. Saul will motion to you if - "
The doorbell rang. I stuck my head around the alcove corner, and there he was on the stoop, five minutes ahead of time. I told Saul to get the stool, and as he headed for the kitchen I started down the hall. At the door I looked back, got a nod from him at the alcove corner, and opened the door.
Richard Wragg was forty-four years old. He lived in an apartment in Brooklyn with a wife and two children and had been with the FBI fifteen years. Detectives

==>  know things. He was about my height, with a long face and a pointed chin, and would be bald on top in four years, or maybe three. He didn't offer to shake, but he turned his back as I peeled his coat off, so he trusted me to a certain extent. When I ushered him to the office and to the red leather chair he stood and looked the room over, and I thought he was too interested in the picture of the waterfall, but perhaps not. He was still standing when the sound of the elevator came and Wolfe entered and stopped short of his desk to say, "Mr. Wragg? I'm Nero Wolfe. Be seated." As he went to his chair Wragg sat down, found he was only on the edge, and slid back. <==
Their eyes met. From my angle I couldn't see Wolfe's, but Wragg's were straight and steady.
"I know about you," Wragg said, "but I've never met you." Wolfe nodded. "Some paths don't cross."
"But now ours have. I assume that this is being recorded."
"No. There is equipment, but it isn't turned on. We might as well ignore such matters. I have assumed for a week that everything said in this house was overheard. You may have a device on your person. I might have my recorder going - though, as I say, I haven't. Let's ignore it."
"We haven't bugged this house."

I came to a stop across the street from 63 Arbor Street. But the thermometer outside the front-room window had said sixteen above zero when I got up, and it had climbed only about five notches since, and I had the keys in my pocket, so I crossed the street, entered, and mounted the two flights to Althaus's apartment. I include this in the report not because it changed anything, but because I

 remember so well my state of mind. Fifty-three hours had passed since I had put the gun under the box spring, and that was time enough for a healthy girl to find a dozen guns and put them somewhere else. If it wasn't there we would now be out on a limb, and a shaky one, since I had told Cramer. He knew Wolfe hadn't sent me there just on a suspicion or a hunch; he knew we knew there was something hot in that apartment, and if it was gone we were in for it. If I told him about the gun I would be admitting I had tampered with evidence; if I didn't, I would be suspected of something even worse, and good-by licenses.
You may not be interested in my state of mind, but believe me I was. At one of the front windows in Althaus's living room I pushed the drape aside and pressed my forehead against the glass so I could see the sidewalk below. That was fairly dumb, but a state of mind cars make you dumb. It was 3:25. I had left Cramer only thirty-five minutes ago, and it would take them about an hour to get the warrant, so what was I expecting to see? Also the glass was cold, and I backed away a couple of inches. But I was really on edge, and now and then I put my forehead to the glass again, and after a while I did see something. Sarah Dacos came in view on the sidewalk with a big brown paper bag under her arm and turned in at the entrance. It was ten minutes to four. Seeing her didn't help my state of mind any. I had nothing against Sarah Dacos. Of course I had nothing for her either. A woman who sends a bullet through a man's pump may or may not deserve some sympathy, but she damn well can't expect a stranger to take a detour if she gets in his way while he's doing a job.
Bending my ears, I heard the door of her apartment open and close.
==> At a quarter past four two police cars stopped out in front. One of them found a spot at the curb and the other one double-parked, and I recognized all three of the homicide dicks who got out and headed for Number 63. One of them, Sergeant Purley Stebbins, was probably thinking of me as he pushed the button at the door. He hates to find Nero Wolfe or me in the same county with a homicide, and here he was on an errand we were responsible for. I wanted to go to the hall to hear the conversation when he showed her the warrant, but didn't. He might smell me and it would hold up the search. <==
It took them not more than ten minutes to find it. They entered the apartment at 4:21, that was when I heard the door close, and Purley left the house with her at 4:43. I'm allowing twelve minutes for him to ask her a few questions after he got the gun. I stood at the window and watched Purley get in the car with her, and

 the car pull off, and then went and sat on the couch. Since he had taken her, the question about the gun was answered. I stayed on the couch a few minutes while my state of mind got adjusted.
I got my hat and coat and went. There was still a NYPD car out in front, waiting for the two dicks still in the apartment, and the driver might know me, but so what? I hadn't recognized him from the window, and I don't know if he knew me or not. As I walked past the car, no hurry, he gave me a hard eye, but that could have been because I had come out of that house.
I walked home. It was a little after half past five, dark, when I mounted the stoop and let myself in. I went to the kitchen, got a glass of milk, and asked Fritz, "Has he told you that we're off the hook?"

"Get him."
I turned and got the phone, but as I started to dial the doorbell rang. I cradled it and went to the hall for a look, turned, and said, "You can ask him for the receipt."
He took a breath. "Is he alone?"
I told him yes and went to the front and opened the door. Cramer didn't have a carton of milk for me. He had nothing at all for me, not even a nod. When I had his coat he made for the office, and when I got there he was planted in the red leather chair and talking. I got the end of it: "...and I might have known better. God knows I "should" know better." He switched to me as I sat. "Where did you get that gun and when did you put it there?"
"Confound it," Wolfe growled, "you shouldn't have come. You should have waited until you had arranged your mind. Archie, get Mr. Wragg."
==> When Cramer is boiling it isn't easy to stop the steam, but that did, the name Wragg. I didn't see him clamp his jaw and glare at Wolfe, I only knew he did, because my back was turned as I dialed LE5-7700. I was supposing it would take patience and staying power to get through to the top, but not at all. Apparently word had been passed down that a call from Nero Wolfe had priority, which was a good sign. In no time the smooth low-pitched drawl was in my ear, and in Wolfe's too, for he had picked up his phone. I stayed on. <==

"Wolfe?"
"Yes. Mr. Wragg?" "Yes."
"I'm ready for that bullet. Now. As we agreed. Bring the bullet, and I surrender the credentials if you are not satisfied within a month. I think it will be sooner, much sooner.
No hesitation. "I'll come." "Now?"

"I don’t know."
"The hell you don’t. If you’re going to start that kind - "
I cut in. "Hold it. Stay in the buggy. As you know, Mr. Wolfe is up in the plant rooms from four to six every day except Sunday. The corn usually comes before six, and either Fritz or I receive it. So Mr. Wolfe doesn’t know, but I do. Kenneth Faber has been bringing it the past five weeks. If you want - "
I stopped because Wolfe was moving. Cramer had dropped the ear of corn onto Wolfe’s desk, and Wolfe had picked it up and felt it, gripping it in the middle,

==>  and now he was shucking it. From where I sat, at my desk, the rows of kernels looked too big, too yellow, and too crowded. Wolfe frowned at it, muttered, "I thought so," put it down, stood up, reached for the carton, said, "You will help, Archie," took an ear, and started shucking it. As I got up Cramer said something but was ignored. <==
When we finished we had three piles, as assorted by Wolfe. Two ears were too young, six were too old, and eight were just right. He returned to his chair, looked at Cramer, and declared, "This is preposterous."
"So you’re stalling," Cramer growled. "No. Shall I expound it?"
"Yeah. Go ahead."
"Since you have questioned men at the restaurant, you know that the corn comes from a man named Duncan McLeod, who grows it on a farm some sixty miles north of here. He has been supplying it for four years, and he knows precisely what I require. It must be nearly mature, but not quite, and it must be picked not more than three hours before it reaches me. Do you eat sweet corn?"
"Yes. You’re stalling."

"Ball game. Yankee Stadium."
"What happened in the ninth inning?" He flipped a hand. "To hell with it. You’d know all right, you’d see to that. How well do you know Max Maslow?"
I raised the brow again. "Connect it, please."
"I’m investigating a murder."
"So I gathered. And apparently I’m a suspect. Connect it."
==> "One item in Kenneth Faber’s pockets was a little notebook. One page had the names of four men written in pencil. Three of the names had checkmarks in front of them. The last one, no checkmark, was Archie Goodwin. The first one was Max Maslow. Will that do?" <==
"I’d rather see the notebook."
"It’s at the laboratory." His voice went up a notch. "Look, Goodwin. You’re a licensed private detective."
I nodded. "But that crack about who Saul Panzer would lie for. Okay, I’ll file it. I don’t know any Max Maslow and have never heard the name before. The other two names with checkmarks?"
"Peter Jay. J-A-Y."
"Don’t know him and never heard of him." "Carl Heydt." He spelled it.

"I shall." He swiveled. "Mr. Cramer. Knowing your considerable talents as I do, I am sometimes dumfounded by your fatuity. You were so bent on baiting Mr. Goodwin that you completely ignored the point I was at pains to make." He pointed at the piles on his desk. "Who picked that corn? Pfui!"
"That’s your point," Cramer rasped. "Mine is who killed Kenneth Faber. Move, Goodwin."
< class="sgc48" id="heading_id_52
AT TWENTY MINUTES PAST ELEVEN Wednesday morning, standing at the curb on Leonard Street with Nathaniel Parker, I said, "Of course in a way it’s a compliment. Last time the bail was a measly five hundred. Now twenty grand. That’s progress."
Parker nodded. "That’s one way of looking at it. He argued for fifty thousand, but I got it down to twenty. You know what that means. They actually - Here’s one."
==> A taxi headed in to us and stopped. When we were in and I had told the driver Eighth Avenue and 35th Street, and we were rolling, Parker resumed, leaning to me and keeping his voice down. The legal mind. Hackies are even better listeners than they are talkers, and that one could be a spy sicked on us by the district attorney. "They actually," he said, "think you may have killed that man. This is serious, Archie. I told the judge that bail in the amount that was asked would be justified only if they had enough evidence to charge you with murder, in which case you wouldn’t be bailable, and he agreed. As your counsel, I must advise you to be prepared for such a charge at any moment. I didn’t like Mandel’s attitude. By the way, Wolfe told me to send my bill to you, not him. He said this is your affair and he isn’t concerned. I’ll make it moderate." <==
I thanked him. I already knew that Assistant District Attorney Mandel, and maybe Cramer too, regarded me as a real candidate for the big one. Cramer had taken me to his place, Homicide South, and after spending half an hour on me

 had turned me over to Lieutenant Rowcliff and gone home. Rowcliff had stood me for nearly an hour - I had him stuttering in fourteen minutes, not a record - and had then sent me under convoy to the DA’s office, where Mandel had taken me on, obviously expecting to make a night of it.
Which he did, with the help of a pair of dicks from the DA’s Homicide Bureau. He had of course been phoned to by both Cramer and Rowcliff, and it was evident from the start that he didn’t merely think I was holding out on details that might be useful, to prevent either bother for myself or trouble for someone else; he had me tagged as a real prospect. Naturally I wanted to know why, so I played along. I hadn’t with Cramer because he had got me sore in front of Wolfe, and I hadn’t with Rowcliff because playing along is impossible with a double-breasted baboon, but with Mandel I could. Of course he was asking the questions, him and the dicks, but the trick is to answer them in such a way that the next question, or maybe one later on, tells you something you want to know, or at least gives you a hint. That takes practice, but I had had plenty, and it makes it simpler when one guy pecks away at you for an hour or so and then backs off, and another guy starts in and goes all over it again.
For instance, the scene of the crime - the alley and receiving platform at the rear of Rusterman’s. Since Wolfe was the trustee, there was nothing about that restaurant I wasn’t familiar with. From the side street it was only about fifteen yards along the narrow alley to the platform, and the alley ended a few feet farther on at the wall of another building. A car or small truck entering to deliver something had to back out. Knowing, as I had, that Kenneth Faber would come with the corn sometime after five o’clock, I could have walked in and hid under the platform behind a concrete post, with the weapon in my hand, and, when Faber drove in, got out, and came around to open the tailgate, he would never know what hit him. If I could have done that, who couldn’t? I would have had to know one other thing, that I couldn’t be seen from the windows of the restaurant kitchen because the glass had been painted on the inside so boys and girls couldn’t climb onto the platform to watch Leo boning a duck or Felix stirring goose blood into a Sauce Rouennaise.

 threaded male at one end and female at the other, old and battered. Easy to hide under a coat. Where it came from might be discovered by one man in ten hours, or by a thousand men in ten years.
Getting those details was nothing, since they would be in the morning papers, but regarding their slant on me I got some hints that the papers wouldn’t have. Hints were the best I could get, no facts to check, so I’ll just report how it looked when Parker came to spring me in the morning. They hadn’t let me see Sue’s statement, but it must have been something in it, or something she had said, or something someone else, maybe Carl Heydt or Peter Jay or Max Maslow, had said, either to her or to the cops. Or possibly something Duncan McLeod, Sue’s father, had said. That didn’t seem likely, but I included him because I saw him. When Parker and I entered the anteroom on our way out he was there on a chair in the row against the wall, dressed for town, with a necktie, his square deep- tanned face shiny with sweat. I crossed over and told him good morning, and he said it wasn’t, it was a bad morning, a day lost and no one to leave to see to things. It was no place for a talk, with people there on the chairs, but I might at least have asked him who had picked the corn if someone hadn’t come to take him inside.
So when I climbed out of the taxi at the corner and thanked Parker for the lift and told him I’d call him if and when, and walked the block and a half on 35th Street to the old brownstone, I was worse off than when I had left, since I hadn’t learned anything really useful, and no matter how Parker defined "moderate," the cost of a twenty-grand bond is not peanuts. I couldn’t expect to pass the buck to Wolfe, since he had never seen either Kenneth Faber or Sue McLeod, and as I mounted the seven steps to the stoop and put my key in the lock I decided not to try to.
The key wasn’t enough. The door opened two inches and stopped. The chain bolt was on. I pushed the button, and Fritz came and slipped the bolt; and his face told me something was stirring before he spoke. If you’re not onto the faces you see most of, how can you expect to tell anything from strange ones? As I crossed the sill I said, "Good morning. What’s up?"
==> He turned from closing the door and stared. "But Archie. You look terrible." "I feel worse. Now what?" <==
"A woman to see you. Miss Susan McLeod. She used to bring - "

 "Yeah. Where is she?"
"In the office."
"Where is he?"

If I had been myself I would have given that offer a little attention, but I was somewhat pooped. So I went, taking my half a glass of milk. The door to the office was closed and, entering, I closed it again. She wasn’t in the red leather chair. Since she was there for me, not for Wolfe, Fritz had moved up one of the yellow chairs for her, but hearing the door open and seeing me she had sprung up, and by the time I had shut the door and turned she was to me, gripping my arms, her head tilted back to get my eyes. If it hadn’t been for the milk I would have used my arms for one of their basic functions, since that’s a sensible way to start a good frank talk with a girl. That being impractical, I tilted my head forward and kissed her. Not just a peck. She not only took it, she helped, and her grip on my arms tightened, and I had to keep the glass plumb by feel since I couldn’t see it. It wouldn’t have been polite for me to quit, so I left it to her.
She let go, backed up a step, and said, "You haven’t shaved."
I crossed to my desk, sipped milk, put the glass down, and said, "I spent the night at the district attorney’s office, and I’m tired, dirty, and sour. I could shower and shave and change in half an hour."
"You’re all right." She plumped onto the chair. "Look at me."
"I am looking at you." I sat. "You’d do fine for a before-and-after vitamin ad. The before. Did you get to bed?"
==> "I guess so, I don’t know." Her mouth opened to pull air in. Not a yawn, just helping her nose. "It couldn’t have been a jail because the windows didn’t have bars. They kept me until after midnight asking questions, and one of them took me home. Oh yes, I went to bed, but I didn’t sleep, but I must have, because I woke up. Archie, I don’t know what you’re going to do to me." <==
"Neither do I." I drank milk, emptying the glass. "Why, have you done something to me?"
"I didn’t mean to."

Of course not."
"It came out. You remember you explained it for me one night."

"When did we make the date to meet there? Of course they asked that."
"They asked everything. I said I phoned you yesterday morning and we made it then."
"It’s just possible that you are dumb. Didn’t you realize they would come to me?"
"Why, of course. And you would deny it. But I thought they would think you just didn’t want to be involved, and I said you weren’t there, and you could probably prove you were somewhere else, so that wouldn’t matter, and I had to give them some reason why I went there and then came away without even going in the restaurant to ask if Ken had been there." She leaned forward. "Don’t

==>  you see, Archie? I couldn’t say I had gone there to see Ken, could I?" <==
"No. Okay, you’re not dumb." I crossed my legs and leaned back. "You had gone there to see Ken?"
"Yes. There was something - about something."
"You got there at a quarter past five?"
"Yes."

"And came away without even going in the restaurant to ask if Ken had been there?"
"I didn’t - Yes, I came away."
I shook my head. "Look, Sue. Maybe you didn’t want to get me involved, but you have, and I want to know. If you went there to see Ken and got there at a quarter past five, you did see him. Didn’t you?"
"I didn’t see him alive." Her hands on her lap, very nice hands, were curled into fists. "I saw him dead. I went up the alley and he was there on the ground. I thought he was dead, but, if he wasn’t, someone would soon come out and find him, and I was scared. I was scared because I had told him just two days ago that I would like to kill him. I didn’t think it out, I didn’t stop to think, I was just scared. I didn’t realize until I was several blocks away how dumb that was."
"Why was it dumb?"
==> "Because Felix and the doorman had seen me. When I came I passed the front of the restaurant, and they were there on the sidewalk, and we spoke. So I couldn’t say I hadn’t been there and it was dumb to go away, but I was scared. When I got to the apartment I thought it over and decided what to say, about going there to meet you, and when a man came and started asking questions I told him about it before he asked." She opened a fist to gesture. "I did think about it, Archie. I did think it couldn’t matter to you, not much." <==
That didn’t gibe with the bypassing-the-checking-station theory, but there was no point in making an issue of it. "You thought wrong," I said, not complaining, just stating a fact. "Of course they asked you why we were going to meet there to have a talk with Ken, since he would be coming here. Why not here instead of

 there?"
"Because you didn’t want to. You didn’t want to talk with him here."
"I see. You really thought it over. Also they asked what we wanted to talk with him about. Had you thought about that?"

"Yes. I don’t see why you say I thought wrong, thinking it wouldn’t matter much to you, because you weren’t there. Can’t you prove you were somewhere else?"
I shut my eyes to look it over. The more I sorted it out, the messier it got. Mandel hadn’t been fooling when he asked the judge to put a fifty-grand tag on me; the wonder was that he hadn’t hit me with the big one.
I opened my itching eyes and had to blink to get her in focus. "For a frame," I said, "it’s close to perfect, but I’m willing to doubt if you meant it. I doubt if you know the ropes well enough, and why pick on me? I am not a patsy. But whether you meant it or not, what are you here for? Why bother to come and tell me about it?"


==> "Because ... I thought ... don’t you understand, Archie?" "I understand plenty, but not why you’re here." <==
"But don’t you see, it’s my word against yours. They told me last night that you denied that we had arranged to meet there. I wanted to ask you ... I thought you might change that, you might tell them that you denied it just because you didn’t want to be involved, that you had agreed to meet me there but you decided not to go, and they’ll have to believe you because of course you were somewhere else. Then they won’t have any reason not to believe me." She put out a hand. "Archie ... will you? Then it will be all right."
"Holy saints. You think so?"
"Of course it will. The way it is now, they think either I’m lying or you’re lying, but if you tell them - "
"Shut up!"
She gawked at me; then all of a sudden she broke. Her head went down, and her hands up to cover her face. Her shoulders started to tremble and then she was shaking all over. If she had sobbed or groaned or something I would have merely waited it out, but there was no sound effect at all, and that was dangerous. She might crack. I went to Wolfe’s desk and got the vase of orchids, Dendrobium nobile that day, removed the flowers and put them on my desk pad, went to her, got fingers under her chin and forced her head up, and sloshed her good. The vase holds two quarts. Her hands came down and I sloshed her again, and she squealed and grabbed for my arm. I dodged, put the vase on my desk, went to the bathroom, which is over in the corner, and came back with a towel. She was on her feet, dabbing at her front. "Here," I said, "use this."

"The hell I didn’t." I got another chair and put it at a dry spot, went to my desk, and sat. "It might help if someone did it to me. Now listen. Whether you meant it or not, I am out on an extremely rickety limb. Ken did not tell me last Tuesday that you thought you were pregnant and he was responsible, he told me nothing whatever, but whether he lied to you or you’re lying to the cops and me, they think he did.

 entrance of that alley yesterday at five o’clock, and I can’t prove I wasn’t there.

I don’t know what else the cops have or haven’t got, but any time now - "
==> "I didn’t lie to you, Archie." She was on the dry chair, gripping the towel. A strand of wet hair dropped over her eye, and she pushed it back. "Everything I told - " <==
"Skip it. Any time now, any minute, I may be hauled in on a charge of murder, and then where am I? Or suppose I somehow made it stick that I did not agree to meet you there, that you’re lying to them, and I wasn’t there. Then where will you be? The way it stands, the way you’ve staged it, today or tomorrow either you or I will be in the jug with no out. So either I - "
"But Archie, you - "
"Don’t interrupt. Either I wriggle off by selling them on you - and by the way, I haven’t asked you." I got up and went to her. "Stand up. Look at me." I extended my hands at waist level, open, palms up. "Put your hands on mine, palms down. No, don’t press, relax, just let them rest there. Damn it, relax! Right. Look at me. Did you kill Ken?"
"No."
"Again. Did you kill him?" "No, Archie!"

 faced her, and spoke. "I’m Nero Wolfe. Will you please move to this chair?" He indicated the red leather chair by a nod, circled around his desk, and sat. He looked at me. "A job that is your style?"
Well. As I remarked when he insisted that I see her in the office, if I hadn’t been pooped I would have given that offer a little attention. If I had been myself I would have known, or at least suspected, what he intended. I suppose he and I came as close to trusting each other as any two men can, on matters of joint concern, but as he had told Parker, this was my affair, and I was discussing it with someone in his office, keeping him away from his favorite chair, and I had just told him that nothing of what I had told Cramer was flummery. So he had gone to the hole in the alcove.

"Okay. Your trick. But I think she has a right to know."
"I agree." Sue had moved to the red leather chair, and he swiveled. "Miss McLeod. I eavesdropped, without Mr. Goodwin’s knowledge. I heard all that was said, and I saw. Do you wish to complain?"
She had fingered her hair back, but it was still a sight. "Why?" she asked.
"Why did I listen? To learn how much of a pickle Mr. Goodwin was in. And I learned. I have intruded because the situation is intolerable. You are either a cockatrice or a witling. Whether by design or stupidity, you have brought Mr. Goodwin to a desperate pass. That is - "
I broke in. "It’s my affair. You said so."
==> He stayed at her. "That is his affair, but now it threatens me. I depend on him. I can’t function properly, let alone comfortably, without him. He just told you he would take a leave of absence. That would be inconvenient for me but bearable, even if it were rather prolonged, but it’s quite possible that I would lose him for good, and that would be a calamity. I won’t have it. Thanks to you, he is in grave jeopardy." He turned. "Archie. This is now our joint affair. By your leave." <==

raised both eyebrows. "Retroactive? Parker and my bail?"
He made a face. "Very well. Intimate or not, you have known Miss McLeod three years. Did she kill that man?"
"No and yes."
"That doesn’t help."

I stared. "You said Ken told you he told me ..." She nodded. "Ken would tell anybody anything." "But you thought you were?"
"Of course not. How could I? There’s only one way a girl can get pregnant, and it couldn’t have been that with me because it’s never happened."

< class="sgc48" id="heading_id_63
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE, I like to kid myself that I know why I think this or do that, but sometimes it just won’t work, and that was once. I don’t mean why I believed her about not being pregnant and how she knew she couldn’t be; I do know that; it was the way she said it and the way she looked. I had known her three years. But since, if I believed her on that, I had to scrap the item I had just given Wolfe for ‘no’ on her killing Faber, why didn’t I change the odds to even money? I pass. I could cook up a case, for instance if she was straight on one thing, about not being pregnant and why not, she was probably straight on other things too, but who would buy it? It’s even possible that every man alive, of whom I am one, has a feeling down below that an unmarried girl who knows she can’t be pregnant is less apt to commit murder than one who can’t be sure. I admit that a good private detective shouldn’t have feelings down below, but have you any suggestions?
==> Since Wolfe pretends to think I could qualify on the witness stand as an expert on attractive young women, of course he turned to me and said, "Archie?" and I nodded yes. An expert shouldn’t back and fill, and as I just said, I believed her on the pregnancy issue. Wolfe grunted, told me to take my notebook, gave her a hard eye for five seconds, and started in. <==
An hour and ten minutes later, when Fritz came to announce lunch, I had filled most of a new notebook and Wolfe was leaning back with his eyes shut and his lips tight. It was evident that he was going to have to work. She had answered all his questions with no apparent fumbling, and it still looked very much as if either I was going to ride the bumps or she was. Or possibly both.
As she told it, she had met Ken Faber eight months ago at a party at the apartment of Peter Jay. Ken had been fast on the follow-up and four months later, in May, she had told him she would marry him some day - say in two or three years, when she was ready to give up modeling - if he had shown that he could support a family. From the notebook: "I was making over eight hundred dollars a week, ten times as much as he was, and of course if I got married I couldn’t expect to keep that up. I don’t think a married woman should model anyway because if you’re married you ought to have babies, and there’s no telling what that will do to you, and who looks after the babies?"
In June, at his request, she had got her father to give him a job on the farm, but

 she had soon regretted it. From the notebook: "Of course he knew I went to the farm weekends in the summer, and the very first weekend it was easy to see what his idea was. He thought it would be different on the farm than in town, it would be easy to get me to do what he wanted, as easy as falling off a log. The second week it was worse, and the third week it was still worse, and I was seeing what he was really like and I wished I hadn’t said I would marry him. He accused me of letting other men do what I wouldn’t let him do, and he tried to make me promise I wouldn’t date any other man, even for dinner or a show. Then the last week in July he seemed to get some sense, and I thought maybe he had just gone through some kind of a phase or something, but last week, Friday evening, he was worse than ever all of a sudden, and Sunday he told me he had told Archie Goodwin that I thought I was pregnant and he was responsible, and of course Archie would pass it on, and if I denied it no one would believe me, and the only thing to do was to get married right away. That was when I told him I’d like to kill him. Then the next day, Monday, Carl - Carl Heydt - told me that Ken had told him the same thing, and I suspected he had told two other men, on account of things they had said, and I decided to go there Tuesday and see him. I was going to tell him he had to tell Archie and Carl it was a lie, and anybody else he had told, and if I had to I’d get a lawyer."

If that was straight, and the part about Carl Heydt and Peter Jay and Max Maslow could be checked, that made it more like ten to one that she hadn’t killed him. She couldn’t have ad-libbed it; she would have had to go there intending to kill him, or at least bruise him, since she couldn’t have just happened to have with her a piece of two-inch pipe sixteen inches long. Say twenty to one. But if she hadn’t, who had? Better than twenty to one, not some thug. There had been eighty bucks in Ken’s pockets, and why would a thug go up that alley with the piece of pipe, much less hide under the platform with it? No. It had to be someone out for Ken specifically who knew that spot, or at least knew about it, and knew he would come there, and when.
Of course it was possible the murderer was someone Sue had never heard of and the motive had no connection with her, but that would make it really tough, and there she was, and Wolfe got all she had - or at least everything she would turn loose of. She didn’t know how many different men she had had dates with in the twenty months she had been modeling - maybe thirty. More in the first year than recently; she had thought it would help to get jobs if she knew a lot of men, and it had, but now she turned down as many jobs as she accepted. When she said she didn’t know why so many men wanted to date her Wolfe made a face, but I

she really meant it. It was hard to believe that a girl with so much born come-on actually wasn’t aware of it, but I knew her, and so did my friend Lily Rowan, who is an expert on women.
She didn’t know how many of them had asked her to marry them; maybe ten; she hadn’t kept count. Of course you don’t like her; to like a girl who says things like that, you’d have to see her and hear her, and if you’re a man you wouldn’t stop to ask whether you liked her or not. I frankly admit that the fact that she couldn’t dance had saved me a lot of wear and tear.

"She has told you what he said he said. She has also told Mr. Goodwin and me. We have spoken with her at length. She came shortly after eleven o’clock this morning to see Mr. Goodwin and stayed two hours."
"My daughter Susan? Came here?" "Yes."
McLeod moved. In no hurry, he went to the red leather chair, sat, focused on Wolfe, and demanded, "What did she come for?"
Wolfe shook his head. "You have it wrong side up. That tone is for us, not you. We may or may not oblige you later; that will depend. The young man you permitted to pick my corn has been murdered, and because of false statements made by your daughter to the police Mr. Goodwin may be charged with murder. The danger is great and imminent. You say you spent yesterday dynamiting stumps and rocks. Until what hour?"
McLeod’s set jaw made his deep-tanned seamed face even squarer. "My daughter doesn’t make false statements," he said. "What were they?"
==> "They were about Mr. Goodwin. Anyone will lie when the alternative is intolerable. She may have been impelled by a desperate need to save herself, but Mr. Goodwin and I do not believe she killed that man. Archie?" <==
I nodded. "Right. Now any odds you want to name." "And we’re going to learn who did kill him. Did you?" "No. But I would have, if ..." He let it hang.
"If what?"
"If I had known what he was saying about my daughter. I told them that, the police. I heard about it from them, and from my daughter, last night and this morning. He was a bad man, an evil man. You say you’re going to learn who killed him, but I hope you don’t. I told them that too. They asked me what you

 did, about yesterday, and I told them I was there in the lot working with the stumps until nearly dark and it made me late with the milking. I can tell you this, I don’t resent you thinking I might have killed him, because I might."

"That’s your interest," Jay said. "To get Goodwin from under." "Certainly. I said so. I - "
"He has known Miss McLeod longer than we have," Maslow said. "He’s the hero type. He rescued her from the sticks and started her on the path of glory. He’s her hero. I asked her once why she didn’t marry him if he was such a prize, and she said he hadn’t asked her. Now you say she has set the police on him. Permit me to say I don’t believe it. If they’re on him they have a damn good reason. Also permit me to say I hope he does get from under, but not by making me the goat. I’m no hero."
Wolfe shook his head. "As I said, I’m reserving what Miss McLeod has told the police. She may tell you if you ask her. As for you gentlemen, I don’t know how curious the police have been about you. Have they tried seriously to find someone who saw one of you in that neighborhood Tuesday afternoon? Of course they have asked you where you were that afternoon, that’s mere routine, but have they properly checked your accounts? Are you under surveillance? I doubt it; and I haven’t the resources for those procedures. I invite you to eliminate yourselves from consideration if you can. The man who killed Kenneth Faber was in that alley, concealed under that platform, shortly after five o’clock yesterday afternoon. Mr. Heydt. Can you furnish incontestable evidence that you weren’t there?"
Heydt cleared his throat. "If I could, I don’t have to furnish it to you. It seems to me - oh, what the hell. No, I can’t."
"Mr. Jay?"
==> "Incontestable, no." Jay leaned forward, his chin out. "I came here because Miss McLeod asked me to, but if I understand what you’re after I might as well go. You intend to find out who killed Faber and pin it on him. To prove it wasn’t Archie Goodwin. Is that it?" <==
"Yes."
"Then count me out. I don’t want Goodwin to get it, but neither do I want

 anyone else to. Not even Max Maslow."
"That’s damn nice of you, Pete," Maslow said. "A real pal." Wolfe turned to him. "You, sir. Can you eliminate yourself?"

Of course I had plenty of time to get there and in between them, but I was curious. It was likely that Jay, not caring about his knuckles, would go for the jaw, and I wanted to see what effect it would have on the twisted smile. My curiosity didn’t get satisfied. As Maslow came up out of the chair he sidestepped, and Jay had to turn, hauling his right back. He started it for Maslow’s jaw by the longest route, and Maslow ducked, came on in, and landed with his right at the very best spot for a bare fist. A beautiful kidney punch. As Jay started to bend Maslow delivered another one to the same spot, harder, and Jay went down. He didn’t tumble, he just wilted. By then I was there. Maslow went to his chair, sat, breathed, and fingered his string tie. The smile was intact, maybe twisted a little more. He spoke to Wolfe. "I hope you didn’t misunderstand me. I wasn’t suggesting that I think he killed Faber. Even if he did I wouldn’t want him to get it. On that point we’re pals. I was only saying I don’t see how you got your reputation if you - You all right, Pete?"
I was helping Jay up. A kidney punch doesn’t daze you, it just makes you sick. I asked him if he wanted a bathroom, and he shook his head, and I steered him to his chair. He turned his face to Maslow, muttered a couple of extremely vulgar words, and belched.

Wolfe spoke. "Will you have brandy, Mr. Jay? Whisky? Coffee?" Jay shook his head and belched again.
Wolfe turned. "Mr. Heydt. The others have made it clear that if they have information that would help to expose the murderer they won’t divulge it. How about you?"
==> Heydt cleared his throat. "I’m glad I don’t have to answer that," he said. "I don’t have to answer it because I have no information that would help. I know Archie Goodwin and I might say we’re friends. If he’s really in a jam I would want to help if I could. You say Miss McLeod has said something to the police that set them on him, but you won’t tell us what she said." <==
"Ask her. You can give me no information whatever?" "No."
Wolfe’s eyes moved right, to the other two, and back again. "I doubt if it’s worth the trouble," he said. "Assuming that one of you killed that man, I doubt if I can get at him from the front; I must go around. But I may have given you a false impression, and if so I wish to correct it. I said that to lift the suspicion from Mr. Goodwin we must find out where it belongs, but that isn’t vital, for we have an alternative. We can merely shift the suspicion to Miss McLeod. That will be simple, and it will relieve Mr. Goodwin of further annoyance. We’ll discuss it after you leave, and decide. You gentlemen may view the matter differently when Miss McLeod is in custody, charged with murder, without bail, but that is your - "
"You’re a goddam liar." Peter Jay.
"Amazing." Max Maslow. "Where did you get your reputation? What do you expect us to do, kick and scream or go down on our knees?"
"Of course you don’t mean it." Carl Heydt. "You said you’re satisfied that she didn’t kill him."

Wolfe nodded. "I doubt if she would be convicted. She might not even go to trial; the police are not blockheads. It will be an ordeal for her, but it will also be a lesson; her implication of Mr. Goodwin may not have been willful, but it was inexcusable." His eyes went to Maslow. "You have mentioned my reputation. I

 made it and I don’t risk it rashly. If tomorrow you learn that Miss McLeod has been arrested and is inaccessible, you may - "
"‘If.’" That crooked smile.
"Yes. It is contingent not on our power but on our preference. I am inviting you gentlemen to have a voice in our decision. You have told me nothing whatever, and I do not believe that you have nothing whatever to tell. Do you want to talk now, to me, or later, to the police, when that woman is in a pickle?"
==> "You’re bluffing," Maslow said. "I call." He got up and headed for the hall. I got up and followed him out, got his hat from the shelf, and opened the front door; and as I closed it behind him and started back down the hall here came the other two. I opened the door again, and Jay, who had no hat, went by and on out, but Heydt stood there. I got his hat and he took it and put it on. "Look, Archie," he said. "You’ve got to do something." <==
"Check," I said. "What, for instance?"
"I don’t know. But about Sue - my God, he doesn’t mean it, does he?"
"It isn’t just a question of what he means, it’s also what I mean. Damn it, I’m short on sleep, and I may soon be short on life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Get the news every hour on the hour. Pleasant dreams."
"What did Sue tell the police about you?"
"No comment. My resistance is low and with the door open I might catch cold. If you don’t mind?"

He grunted. "Have you finished it?" "Yes. Twelve pages."
"May I see it?"
Not an order, a request. At least he was remembering that it was a joint affair. I opened a drawer, got the original, and took it to him. He inspected the heading

 and the first page, flipped through the sheets, took a look at the end, dropped it on his desk, and said, "Your notebook, please." I sat and got my notebook and pen.
==> "There will be two," he said, "one for you and one for me. First mine. Heading in caps, affidavit by Nero Wolfe. The usual State of New York, County of New York. The text: I hereby depose that the twelve foregoing typewritten pages attached hereto, comma, each page initialed by me, comma, are a full and accurate record of a conversation that took place in my office on October thirteenth, nineteen sixty-one, by Susan McLeod, comma, Archie Goodwin, comma, and myself, semicolon; that nothing of consequence has been omitted or added in this typewritten record, semicolon; and that the conversation was wholly impromptu, comma, with no prior preparation or arrangement. A space for my signature, and below, the conventional formula for notarizing. The one for you, on the same sheet if there is room, will be the same with the appropriate changes." <==
I looked up. "All right, it wasn’t just to keep me off your neck. Okay on the power. But there’s still the if on the preference. She didn’t kill him. She came to me and opened the bag. I’m her hero. She as good as told Maslow that she’d marry me if I asked her. Maybe she could learn how to dance if she tried hard, though I admit that’s doubtful. She makes a lot more than you pay me, and we could postpone the babies. You said you doubt if she would be convicted, but that’s not good enough. Before I sign that affidavit I would need to know that you won’t chuck the joint affair as soon as the heat is off of me."
"Rrrhhh," he said.
"I agree," I said, "it’s a goddam nuisance. It’s entirely her fault, she dragged me in without even telling me, and if a girl pushes a man in a hole he has a right to wiggle out, but you must remember that I am now a hero. Heroes don’t wiggle. Will you say that it will be our joint affair to make sure that she doesn’t go to trial?"
"I wouldn’t say that I will make sure of anything whatever." "Correction. That you will be concerned?"
He took air in, all the way, through his nose, and let it out through his mouth. "Very well. I’ll be concerned." He glanced at the twelve pages on his desk. "Will

"Then he did?" Peter Jay. "He did it?"
"We did. I share the glory. We did."
"Glory hell." Max Maslow. "You know Sue didn’t kill Ken Faber. He said so."
"He said we were satisfied that she didn’t. We still are. He also said that we doubt if she’ll be convicted. He also said that our interest was to get me from under, and we had alternatives. We could either find out who killed Faber, for which we needed your help; or, if you refused to help, we could switch it to Sue. You refused, and we switched it, and I am in the clear, and here you are. Why? Why should he waste time on you now? He is busy on an important matter; he’s reading a book entitled My Life in Court, by Louis Nizer. Why should he put it down for you?"
==> "I can’t believe it, Archie." Carl Heydt had hold of my arm. "I can’t believe you’d do a thing like this - to Sue - when you say she didn’t - " <==
"You never can tell, Carl. There was that woman who went to the park every day to feed the pigeons, but she fed her husband arsenic. I have a suggestion. This is Mr. Wolfe’s house and he doesn’t want you in it, but if you guys have changed your minds, at least two of you, about helping to find out who killed Faber, I’m a licensed detective too and I could spare a couple of hours. We can sit here on the steps, or we can go somewhere - "
"And you can tell us," Maslow said, "what Sue told the cops that got them on you. I may believe that when I hear it."
"You won’t hear it from me. That’s not the idea. You tell me things. I ask questions and you answer them. If I don’t ask them, who will? I doubt if the cops or the DA will; they’ve got too good a line on Sue. I’ll tell you this much, they know she was there Tuesday at the right time, and they know that she lied to them about what she was there for and what she saw. I can spare an hour or two."
They exchanged glances, and they were not the glances of buddies with a common interest. They also exchanged words and found they agreed on one point: if one of them took me up they all would. Peter Jay said we could go to his place and they agreed on that too, and we descended to the sidewalk and

I nodded. "That’s a fair question. Until noon today, a little before noon, they thought I was. Then they found out I wasn’t. They didn’t just guess again, they found out, and that’s why they took her down and they’re going to keep her. Which - "
"How did they find out?"
"Ask them. You can be sure it was good. They were liking it fine, having me on a hook, and they hated to see me flop off. It had to be good, and it was. Which brings me to the point. I think Sue’s lie was part truth. I think she had arranged with someone to meet her there at five o’clock. She got there fifteen minutes late and he wasn’t there, and she went down the alley and saw Faber dead, and what would she think? That’s obvious. No wonder she panicked. She went home and looked it over. She couldn’t deny she had been there because she had been seen. If she said she had gone there on her own to see Faber, alone, they wouldn’t believe she hadn’t gone in the alley, and they certainly would believe she had killed him. So she decided to tell the truth, part of it, that she had arranged to meet someone and she got there late and he wasn’t there and she had left - leaving out that she had gone in the alley and seen the body. But since she thought that the man she had arranged to meet had killed Faber she couldn’t name him; but they would insist on her naming him. So she decided to name me.

wasn’t so dirty really; she thought I could prove I was somewhere else, having decided not to meet her. I couldn’t, but she didn’t know that." I turned a palm up. "So the point is, who had agreed to meet her there?"
==> Heydt said, "That took a lot of cutting and fitting, Archie." <==
"You were going to ask questions," Maslow said. "Ask one we can answer."
"I’ll settle for that one," I said. "Say it was one of you, which of course I am saying. I don’t expect him to answer it. If Sue stands pat and doesn’t name him and it gets to where he has to choose between letting her go to trial and unloading, he might come across, but not here and now. But I do expect the other two to consider it. Put it another way: if Sue decided to jump on Faber for the lies he was spreading around and to ask one of you to help, which one would she pick? Or still another: which one of you would be most likely to decide to jump Faber and ask Sue to join in? I like the first one better because it was probably her idea." I looked at Heydt. "What about it, Carl? Just a plain answer to a plain question. Which one would she pick? You?"
"No. Maslow."
"Why?"
"He’s articulate and he’s tough. I’m not tough, and Sue knows it."

THE FIRST CITY EMPLOYEE to arrive, four or five minutes after Wolfe hung up, was one in uniform. Wolfe was telling me what Saul’s errand had been when the doorbell rang, and since I resented the interruption I trotted to the front, opened the door, saw a prowl car at the curb, and demanded rudely, "Well?"
"Where’s that carton?" he demanded back.
"Where it will stay until someone comes who knows something." I was shutting the door but his foot was there.
==> "You’re Archie Goodwin," he said. "I know about you. I’m coming in. Did you yell for help or didn’t you?" <==
He had a point. An officer of the law doesn’t have to bring a search warrant to enter a house whose owner has asked the police to come and get a carton of maybe dynamite. I gave him room to enter, shut the door, took him to the office, pointed to the carton, and said, "If you touch it and it goes off we can sue you for damages."
"You couldn’t pay me to touch it," he said. "I’m here to see that nobody does." He glanced around, went over by the big globe, and stood, a good fifteen feet away from the carton. With him there, the rest of the explanation of Saul’s errand had to wait, but I had something to look at to pass the time - a carbon copy, one sheet, which Wolfe had taken from his desk drawer and handed me, of something Saul had typed on my machine during my absence Thursday evening.
The second city employee to arrive, at ten minutes to six, was Inspector Cramer. When the bell rang and I went to let him in the look on his face was one I had seen before. He knew Wolfe had something fancy by the tail, and he would have given a month’s pay before taxes to know what. He tramped to the office, saw the carton, turned to the cop, got a salute but didn’t acknowledge it, and said, "You can go, Schwab."
"Yes, sir. Stay out front?" "No. You won’t be needed."
Fully as rude as I had been, but he was a superior officer. Schwab saluted again and went. Cramer looked at the red leather chair. He always sat there, but the

"... But if you insist, very well. My reason for thinking it may contain an explosive is that it was brought by a stranger. My name printed on it was as usual, but naturally such a detail would not be overlooked. There are a number of people in the metropolitan area who have reason to wish me ill, and it would be imprudent - "
"My God, you can lie."
Wolfe tapped the desk with a fingertip. "Mr. Cramer. If you insist on lies you’ll get them. Until I know what’s in that carton. Then we’ll see." He picked up his book, opened to his place, and swiveled to get the light right.
Cramer was stuck. He looked at me, started to say something, and vetoed it. He couldn’t get up and go because he had told the Bomb Squad to call him there, but an inspector couldn’t just sit. He took a cigar from a pocket, looked at it, put it back, arose, came to me, and said, "I’ve got some calls to make." Meaning he wanted my chair, which was a good dodge since it got some action; I had to move. He stayed at the phone nearly half an hour, making four or five calls, none of which sounded important, then got up and went over to the big globe and started studying geography. Ten minutes was enough for that, and he switched to the bookshelves. Back at my desk, leaning back with my legs crossed, my hands clasped behind my head, I noted which books he took out and looked at. Now that I knew who had killed Ken Faber, little things like that were interesting. The one he looked at longest was The Coming Fury, by Bruce Carton. He was still at that when the phone rang. I turned to get it, but by the time I had it to my ear he was there. A man asked for Inspector Cramer and I handed it to him and permitted myself a grin as I saw Wolfe put his book down and reach for his phone. He wasn’t going to take hearsay, even from an inspector.
It was a short conversation; Cramer’s end of it wasn’t more than twenty words. He hung up and went to the red leather chair. "Okay," he growled. "If you had opened that carton they wouldn’t have found all the pieces. You didn’t think it was dynamite, you knew it was. Talk."
==> Wolfe, his lips tight, was breathing deep. "Not me," he said. "It would have been Archie or Fritz, or both of them. And of course my house. The possibility occurred to me, and I came down, barely in time. Three minutes later ... Pfui. <==

 That man is a blackguard." He shook his head, as if getting rid of a fly. "Well. Shortly after ten o’clock last evening I decided how to proceed, and I sent for Saul Panzer. When he came - "
"Who put that dynamite in that carton?"
"I’m telling you. When he came I had him type something on a sheet of paper and told him to drive to Duncan McLeod’s farm this morning and give it to Mr. McLeod. Archie. You have the copy."
I took it from my pocket and went and handed it to Cramer. He kept it, but this is what it said:

MEMORANDUM FROM NERO WOLFE TO DUNCAN MCLEOD
I suggest that you should have in readiness acceptable answers to the following questions if and when they are asked:
1. When did Kenneth Faber tell you that your daughter was pregnant and he was responsible?
2. Where did you go when you drove away from your farm Tuesday afternoon around two o’clock - perhaps a little later - and returned around seven o’clock, late for milking?

 got set in the alcove and started up. After rounds with Lily and three or four others, I approached Sue McLeod and offered a hand.
She gave me a look. "You know you don’t want to. Let’s go outside."
I said it was cold, and she said she knew it and headed for the foyer. We got her wrap, a fur thing which she probably didn’t own, since top-flight models are offered loans of everything from socks to sable, went back in, on through, and out to the terrace. There were evergreens in tubs, and we crossed to them for shelter from the wind.
"You told Lily I hate you," she said. "I don’t."
"Not ‘hate,’" I said. "She misquoted me or you’re misquoting her. She said I should dance with you and I said when I tried it a month ago you froze."
==> "I know I did." She put a hand on my arm. "Archie. It was hard, you know it was. If I hadn’t got my father to let him work on the farm ... it was my fault, I know it was ... but I couldn’t help thinking if you hadn’t sent him that ... letting him know you knew..." <==
"I didn’t send it, Mr. Wolfe did. But I would have. Okay, he was your father, so it was hard. But no matter whose father he was, I’m not wearing an arm band for the guy who packed dynamite in that carton."
"Of course not. I know. Of course not. I tell myself I’ll have to forget it ... but it’s not easy..." She shivered. "Anyway I wanted to say I don’t hate you. You don’t have to dance with me, and you know I’m not going to get married until I can stop working and have babies, and I know you never are, and even if you do it will be Lily, but you don’t have to stand there and let me really freeze, do you?"
I didn’t. You don’t have to be rude, even with a girl who can’t dance, and it was cold out there.

REX STOUT
NATURALLY MOST OF THE ITEMS in the mail that is delivered to the old brownstone on West 35th Street are addressed to Nero Wolfe, but since I both work and live there eight or ten out of a hundred are addressed to me. It is my custom to let my share wait until after I have opened Wolfe’s, looked it over, and put it on his desk, but sometimes curiosity butts in. As it did that Tuesday morning when I came to an elegant cream-colored envelope, outsize, addressed to me on a typewriter, with the return address in the corner engraved in dark brown:
JAMES NEVILLE VANCE
Two Nineteen Horn Street New York 12 New York
Never heard of him. It wasn’t flat; it bulged with something soft inside. Like everybody else, I occasionally get envelopes containing samples of something that bulges them, but not expensive envelopes with engraving that isn’t phony. So I slit it open and removed the contents. A folded sheet of paper that matched the envelope, including the engraved name and address, had a message typed in the center:
==> Archie Goodwin - Keep this until you hear from me. JNV <==
"This" was a necktie, a four-in-hand, neatly folded to go in the envelope. I stretched it out - long, narrow, maybe silk, light tan, almost the same color as the stationery, with thin brown diagonal lines. A Sutcliffe label, so certainly silk, say twenty bucks. But he should have sent it to the cleaners instead of me, because it had a spot, a big one two inches long, near one end, about the same tone of brown as the thin lines; but the lines’ brown was clean and live and the spot’s brown was dirty and dead. I sniffed at it, but I am not a beagle. Having seen a few dried bloodstains here and there, I knew the dirty color was right, but that’s

 no phenolphthalin test. Even so, I told myself as I dropped the tie in a drawer, supposing that James Neville Vance worked in a butcher shop and forgot his bib, why pick on me? As I closed the drawer I shrugged.
That’s the way to take it when you get a bloodstained (maybe) necktie in the mail from a stranger, just shrug, but I admit that in the next couple of hours I did something and didn’t do something else. What I did do was ring Lon Cohen at the Gazette to ask a question, and an hour later he called back to say that James Neville Vance, now in his late fifties, still owned all the real estate he had inherited from his father, still spent winters on the Riviera, and was still a bachelor; and what did he want of a private detective? I reserved that. What I didn’t do was take a walk. When nothing is stirring and Wolfe has given me no program I usually go out after the routine morning chores to work my legs and have a look at the town and my fellow men, not to mention women, but that morning I skipped it because JNV might come or phone. It had been an honest shrug, but you can’t shrug all day.
I might as well have had my walk because the phone call didn’t come until a quarter past eleven, after Wolfe had come down to the office from his two-hour morning session with the orchids up in the plant rooms on the roof. He had put a spray of Cymbidium Doris in the vase on his desk and got his personal seventh of a ton disposed in his oversize custom-made chair, and was scowling at the dust jacket of a book, one of the items that had been addressed to him, when the phone rang and I got it.

==> "Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie Goodwin speaking." "Is this Archie Goodwin?" <==
Three people out of ten will do that. I am always tempted to say no, it’s a trained dog, and see what comes next, but I might get barked at. So I said, "It is. In person."
"This is James Neville Vance. Did you receive something in the mail from me?"
His voice couldn’t decide whether to be a squeak or a falsetto and had the worst features of both. "Yes, presumably," I said. "Your envelope and letterhead."
"And an enclosure." "Right."

"In the Village. Thirty-minute walk. I’ve had no walk." "Very well." He opened the book.

MOST OF THE HOUSES on Horn Street, which is only three blocks long, could stand a coat of paint, but Number 219, a four-story brick, was all dressed up - the brick cream-colored and the trim dark brown; and the Venetian blinds at the windows matched the bricks. Since Vance was in clover I supposed it was just for him, but in the vestibule there were three names in a panel on the wall with buttons. The bottom one was Fougere, the middle one was Kirk, and the top one was James Neville Vance. I pushed the top one, and after a wait a voice came from a grill. "Who is it?"
==> I stooped a little to put my mouth on a level with the lower grill and said, "My name is Archie Goodwin. I’d like to see Mr. Vance." <==
"This is Vance. What do you want?"
It was a baritone, no trace of a squeak. I told the grill, "I have something that belongs to you and I want to return it."
"You have something that belongs to me?" "Right."
"What is it and where did you get it?"
"Correction. I think it belongs to you. It’s a four-in-hand silk tie, Sutcliffe label, the same color as this house, with diagonal lines the same color as the trim. Cream and brown."

 for the first seven months of nineteen sixty-two is nine grand behind nineteen sixty-one. I am performing one of the main functions you pay me for."
"Not brilliantly," he said and picked up the book. Merely a childish gesture, since Fritz would enter in eight minutes to announce lunch. I went and opened the safe and stashed my souvenirs on a shelf in the inner compartment.
43
INSPECTOR CRAMER of Homicide South came at ten minutes past six.
I had been functioning all afternoon, I don’t say brilliantly. During lunch, in the dining room across the hall, while listening to Wolfe’s table talk with one ear, I decided to make myself scarce while I considered the matter. There was no sense in getting out on a limb just for the hell of it, and a homicide dick might show any minute, so as we left the table I told Wolfe that since we had no expectations or desires I was going out on some personal chores. He gave me a sharp glance, made a face, and headed for the office. As I was turning to the front the phone rang and I went in and got it. If it was the DA’s office inviting me to call, I would make up my mind on the way downtown.
==> It was Lon Cohen. He had compliments. "No question about it, Archie," he said, "you’d be worth your weight in blood rubies to any newspaper in town, especially the Gazette. At nine-thirty you phone for dope on James Neville Vance. At twelve-twenty, less than three hours later, a cop finds a body in his house and both you and he are present. Marvelous. Any leg man can find out what happened, but knowing what’s going to happen - you’re one in ten million. What’s on the program for tomorrow? I only want a day at a time." <==
I was a little short with him because my problem was the program for today.
I was out of the house and halfway to Eighth Avenue, no destination in mind, when I realized I was ignoring the main point - no, two main points. One, if a dick came before Wolfe went up to the plant rooms at four o’clock, Wolfe might possibly give him the souvenirs, to keep me out of trouble. Two, if the spot on the tie wasn’t blood and its being sent to me was just some kind of a gag, and it had no connection with a murder, I was stewing about nothing. So I turned and went back. Wolfe, at his desk with his book, apparently paid no attention as I opened the safe and took out the souvenirs, but of course he saw. I pocketed

 them and left.
Twenty minutes later I was seated in a room on the tenth floor of a building on 43rd Street, telling a man at a desk, "This is for me personally, Mr. Hirsh, not for Mr. Wolfe, but it’s possible that he may have a use for it before long." I put the tie on the desk and pointed to the spot. "How long will it take to tell what that is?"

So, I told myself as I got the lobster out, I got not only my money’s worth but my time’s worth, and by the time I was upstairs and in my pajamas I had decided that if Wolfe wasn’t interested I certainly was, and I was going to find out who had sent me that tie even if I had to take a month’s leave of absence.
Except in emergencies I get a full eight hours’ sleep, and that was merely a project, not an emergency, so I didn’t get down for breakfast, which I eat in the kitchen, until after ten o’clock. As I got orange juice from the refrigerator and Fritz started the burner under the cake griddle he asked where I had dined, and I said he knew darned well I hadn’t dined at all, since I had phoned that I was at the DA’s office, and he nodded and said, "These clients in trouble."
"Look, Fritz," I told him, "you’re a chef, not a diplomat, so why do you keep that up? You know we’ve had no client for a month and you want to know if we’ve hooked one, so why don’t you just ask? Repeat after me, ‘Have we got a client?’

 Try it."
==> "Archie." He turned a palm up. "You would have to say yes or no. The way I do it, you can biaiser if you wish." <==
I had to ask him how to spell it so I could look it up when I went to the office. Sitting, I picked up the Times, and my brow went up when I saw that it had made the front page. Probably on account of Martin Kirk; the Times loves architects as much as it hates disk jockeys and private detectives. It had nothing useful to add to what I had got from Lon, but it mentioned that Mrs. Kirk had been born in Manhattan, Kansas. Any other paper which had dug up that detail would have had a feature piece about born in Manhattan and died in Manhattan.
After three griddle cakes with homemade sausage and one with thyme honey, and two cups of coffee, I made it to the office in time to have the desks dusted, fresh water in the vase, biaiser looked up, and the mail opened, when Wolfe came down from the plant rooms. I waited until the orchids were in the vase and he had sat and glanced through the mail to tell him that it now looked as if someone had sent me a hot piece of evidence in a homicide, and I intended to find out why, of course on my own time, and anyway he wouldn’t be needing me since apparently there was nobody that needed him.
His lips tightened. "Evidence? Merely a conjecture."
"No, sir. I took it to Ludlow and it’s human blood. So I gave it to Cramer. Of
course you’ve read the Times?" "Yes."

Wolfe made a face. That complicated it. The mere thought of a man going without food was disagreeable, and to have one there in his house was intolerable. He had to either get him out in a hurry or feed him. "Why should I

 make allowances?" he demanded.
Kirk actually tried to smile, and it made me want to feed him myself. "I know about you," he said. "You’re hard. And you charge high fees. I can pay you, don’t worry about that. They think I killed my wife. They let me go, but they - "
"Did you kill your wife?"
==> "No. But they think I did, and they think they can prove it. I haven’t got a lawyer, and I don’t know any lawyer I want to go to. I came to you because I know about you - partly that, and partly because they asked me a lot of questions about you - about you and Archie Goodwin." He looked at me, blinking to manage the change of focus. "You’re Archie Goodwin, aren’t you?" <==
I told him yes and he went back to Wolfe. "They asked if I knew you or Goodwin, if I had ever met you, and they seemed to think I had - no, they did think I had. It seemed to have some connection with something that was mailed to Goodwin, and something about a necktie, and something about a phone call he got yesterday. I’m sorry to be so vague, but I said you’d have to make allowances, I’m not myself. I haven’t been myself since - I found - " His jaw had started to work and he stopped to control it. "My wife," he said. "They kept at me that she wasn’t much of a wife, and all right, she wasn’t, but if a woman - I mean if a man - "
He stopped again to handle his jaw. In a moment he went on, "So I came to you partly because I thought you might know about a necktie and a phone call and something that was mailed to Goodwin. Do you?"
"Possibly." Wolfe was regarding him. "Mr. Kirk. You said you can pay me, but I don’t sell information; I sell only services."
"That’s what I want, your services."
"You want to hire me to investigate this affair?" "Yes. That’s why I’m here."

 comprehend?"
"I’m better. I didn’t think I could eat. I’m glad you made me." He didn’t look any better.
Wolfe nodded. "The brain can be hoodwinked but not the stomach. First, then, your statement that you didn’t kill your wife is of course of no weight. I have assumed that you didn’t for reasons of my own, which I reserve. Do you know or suspect who did kill her?"
"No. There are - No."
==> "Then attend. An item in yesterday’s mail to this house was an envelope addressed to Mr. Goodwin, typewritten. A paper inside had a typewritten note saying, ‘Archie Goodwin, keep this until you hear from me, JNV.’ The envelope and paper were the engraved stationery of James Neville Vance. Also in the envelope was a four-in-hand necktie, cream-colored with brown diagonal stripes, and it had a spot on it, a large brown stain." <==
Kirk was squinting, concentrating. "So that’s how it was. They never told me exactly..."
"They wouldn’t. Neither would I if I weren’t engaged in your interest. At a quarter past eleven yesterday morning Mr. Goodwin got a phone call, and a voice that squeaked, presumably for disguise, said it was James Neville Vance and asked him to burn what he had received in the mail. Mr. Goodwin, provoked, went to Two-nineteen Horn Street and was admitted by Vance, who identified the tie as one of his but denied that he had sent it. As Mr. Goodwin was about to go a policeman arrived who wanted access to your apartment, and he was with Mr. Vance and the policeman when your wife’s body was discovered, but he left immediately. Later he took - "
"But what - "
"Don’t interrupt. He took the tie to a laboratory and learned that the spot was human blood. He gave the tie, and the envelope and letterhead, to a law officer who had been told of the tie episode by Mr. Vance, and the police have established that the blood is the same type as your wife’s. You say they think they can prove that you killed your wife. Did they take your fingerprints?"
"Yes. They - I let them."

"He must be. I saw him come in and I haven’t seen him come out." "Then he’s here. And?"
"Would you mind telling me whose house - who lives here?" "Nero Wolfe. It’s his house and he lives here."
"That’s an odd name. Nero Wolfe? What does he - Is he a lawyer?"
Either she meant it or she was extremely good. If the former, it would be a pleasure to tell Wolfe and see him grunt. "No," I said. Let her work for it.
"Is Mr. Kirk all right?"
==> "We haven’t been introduced," I said. "My name is Archie Goodwin and I live here. Your turn." <==


Her mouth opened and closed again. She considered it, her eyes meeting mine exactly as they had when she couldn’t see me. "I’m Rita Fougere," she said. "Mrs. Paul Fougere. Will you tell Mr. Kirk I’m here and would like to see him?"
It was my turn to consider. The rule didn’t apply - the rule that I am to take no one in to Wolfe without consulting him; she wanted to see Kirk, not Wolfe. And I was riled. The tie had been mailed to me, not him, but he hadn’t even glanced at me before taking Kirk on and feeding him. I was by no means satisfied that Kirk was straight, and I wanted to see how he took it when Paul Fougere’s wife suddenly appeared.
"You might as well tell him yourself," I said. "Also you might as well know that Nero Wolfe is a private detective, and so am I. Come in."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74320    window = 74315 74325


I had known when I let them in that Fougere had decided on his line. It’s easy to see when a man’s all set. So the unexpected question flustered him. "You know damn well I didn’t," he said. "You know who did, or you ought to."
"Possibly I don’t. Do you?"
Fougere looked at his wife, at me, and back at Wolfe. He was adjusting. "You’d like that, wouldn’t you?" he said. "With witnesses. All right, I can’t prove it, and

 anyway that’s not up to me, it’s up to the cops. But I’m not going to sign anything. I’ve told Vance I shouldn’t have said it, and I’ve told my wife. Ask her." He turned to me. "You were the only other one that heard me. I’m telling you now, I can’t prove it and I shouldn’t have said it." Back to Wolfe: "That covers it. Now try hooking me for defamation of character."
==> "Pfui." Wolfe flipped a hand to dismiss it. "I never intended to. That was only to get you here. I wanted to tell you something and ask you something. First, you’re a blatherskite. You may perhaps know that Mr. Kirk didn’t kill his wife, but you can’t possibly know that he did. Manifestly you’re either a jackass or a murderer, and conceivably both." He turned his head. "Archie. A twenty-dollar bill, please." <==
I went to the safe and got a twenty from the petty cash drawer and came back and offered it, but he shook his head. "Give it to Mrs. Fougere." To Paul: "I assume your wife is an acceptable stakeholder. Give her a dollar. Twenty to one Mr. Kirk did not kill his wife."
"You’ve got a bet." Fougere got out his wallet, extracted a bill, and handed it to me. "You keep it, Goodwin. My wife might spend it. I suppose his conviction decides it? Do I have to wait until after the appeals and all the horsing around?"
Obviously Rita wasn’t hearing him. Probably she had had a lot of practice at not hearing him. She was gazing at Wolfe. "You really mean that, don’t you?" she asked. "You mean it?"
"I expect to win that dollar, madam." His eyes stayed at Fougere. "As for you, sir, let’s see how sure you are. I would like to ask some questions which may give you a hint of my expectations. If you don’t care to hear them you are of course at liberty to go."
Fougere laughed. It would be fair to say that he giggled, but I’ll give him a break. He laughed. "Hell, I’ve got a bet down," he said. "Go right ahead. You’ve already asked me if I killed her. I’ve answered that."

Cramer uttered a word about the same flavor as the one Fougere had used, but of

course there was no lady present. He followed it up. "I suppose I’d send it to the Commissioner so he could frame it?" He flattened his palms on the chair arms. "Look, Wolfe. I know you. I know you’ve got something. I admit your four points taken together add up. I’ll take your word that you won’t send Goodwin to break and enter. I know I can’t pry any more out of you even if it wasn’t time for you to eat, and anyway I eat too. But you say I’m to keep Vance until I hear from you or Goodwin, and that might mean all night, and he’s not just some bum. Nothing doing. Make it tomorrow morning, say ten o’clock, and limit it to six hours if I don’t hear from you or Goodwin, and I’ll buy it."
Wolfe grinned. "That’s better anyway. I was rushing it. I said send a man to get him."
"I heard you."
==> "Very well." Wolfe turned. "Archie. Mr. Cramer and I need a few minutes to make sure of details. Tell Fritz. And use the phone in the kitchen to get Mrs. Fougere. I must see her this evening. Also get Saul and Fred and Orrie. I want them either this evening or at eight in the morning." <==
I rose. "Does it matter which?" "No."
I beat it to the kitchen.

IF YOU EVER NEED an operative and only the best will do, get Saul Panzer if you can. If Saul isn’t available, get Fred Durkin or Orrie Cather. That was the trio who entered James Neville Vance’s apartment with me at a quarter past ten Thursday morning.
What made the entry legal was that when I rang the bells, both downstairs and upstairs, the doors were opened from the inside. Who opened them was Rita Fougere. Upstairs she held it open until we were in and then closed it. I preferred not to touch the door - not that it mattered, but I like things neat.

Silence. "No." More silence. "Confound it." Still more. "Very well. Fritz will have something ready."
"Better make it half past and - " He had hung up.

INSPECTOR CRAMER SETTLED BACK in the red leather chair, narrowed his eyes at Wolfe, and rasped, "I’ve told Mr. Vance that this won’t be on any official record and he can answer your questions or not as he pleases."
He wouldn’t have settled back if he had been the only city employee present, since he knew that almost certainly some fur was going to fly. Sergeant Purley Stebbins was there at his right on a chair against the wall. Purley never sits with his back to anyone, even his superior officer, if he can help it. James Neville Vance was on a chair facing Wolfe’s desk, between Cramer and me. Rita Fougere was on the couch at the left of my desk, and Saul and Fred and Orrie were grouped over by the big globe.
==> "There won’t be many questions," Wolfe told Cramer. "Nothing remains to be satisfied but my curiosity on a point or two." His head turned. "Mr. Vance, only you can satisfy it." To me: "Archie?" <==
I regretted having to take my eyes away from Vance. Not that I thought he needed watching; it was just that I wanted to. You can learn things, or you think you can, from the face of a man who knows something is headed for him but doesn’t know exactly what and is trying to be ready to meet it. Up to that point Vance’s face hadn’t increased my knowledge of human nature. His lips were drawn in tight, and that made his oversized chin even more out of proportion.

 When Wolfe cued me I had to leave it. I got the seven ties from a drawer, put them in a row on Wolfe’s desk, and stood by.
"Those," Wolfe told Vance, "are the seven ties that remained on the rack in your closet. I produce them - "
A growl from Cramer stopped him. It would have stopped anybody. It became words. "So you did. Stebbins, take Mr. Vance out to the car. I want to talk to Wolfe."

"Yes. If you want to put it that way, I am."
"Very well. You remember Mr. Goodwin."
Whipple shot me a glance. "Of course."
"Will you arrange for him to meet Miss Brooke? Perhaps a meal, lunch or dinner, with you, her, and your son? With some plausible pretext?"
He was looking doubtful. "I'm afraid that isn't possible. She knows what I - my attitude. Does Mr. Goodwin have to meet her? And my son?"
==> "Not necessarily your son. Her, yes. I can't proceed until he has seen her, spoken with her, and if possible danced with her, and reported. This may even settle it. His feeling for attractive young women, his understanding of them, and his talent for gaining their confidence may be all we'll need." He turned. "Archie. Have you a suggestion?" <==
I nodded. "Sure." He had asked for it. "I meet her, feel her out, understand her, get her confidence, bring her here and install her in the south room, and you seduce her and then marry her. As for the difficulties, snags, embar - "
Whipple cut in. "Mr. Goodwin. You can joke about it, but I can't."
I met his eyes. "I wouldn't expect you to, Mr. Whipple. I was merely reacting to Mr. Wolfe's joke about me and attractive young women. But of course I'll have to meet her. He never leaves the house on business. How urgent is it? Have they set a date for the wedding?"
"No."
"How sure are you they're not already married?"

The light was bad, but I have good eyes. I started at August 7, a week before the date Drucker had named, to see if there was any mention of a Harvard man's arrival or presence in town, but there wasn't. On the fifteenth, there it was, front page. His name was Richard Ault and his home town was Evansville, Indiana. It was front page again on Sunday the sixteenth, but on Monday it was inside and on Tuesday there was nothing. I went on and finished the week but drew blanks, then went back to the first three days and read them again.
There was no hint anywhere of any covering up. The three eyewitnesses had been interviewed, and there were no discrepancies or contradictions. The porch was in plain view from the sidewalk; the two women had seen him with the gun in his hand before he had raised it, and one of them had yelled at him. The man had run across the street and had got to the porch as Mrs. Brooke and Susan emerged from the house. Susan had refused to be interviewed that evening, but had told her story to a reporter Saturday morning and had answered his questions freely.
Even if I had been hell-bent on getting something on her I would have had to cross that off and look elsewhere. I put the papers back where they belonged, told the guardian I had done no clipping or tearing, returned to the hotel, treated myself to a glass of milk in the coffee shop, and went up to bed.
I don't know whether I would have looked any further in Racine or not if there had been no interruption. Probably not, since I had learned what was in her mind when she said "then something happened," and that was what had sent me. The interruption woke me up Tuesday morning. I had left a call for eight o'clock, and when the phone rang I didn't believe it and looked at my watch. Ten after seven. I thought, Damn hotels anyway, reached for the phone, and was told I was being called from New York. I said here I am, and was figuring that in New York it was ten after eight, when Wolfe's voice came.

==> Archie?" <==
"Right. Good morning." "It isn't. Where are you?" "In bed."
"I do not apologize for disturbing you. Get up and come home. Miss Brooke is dead. Her body was found last evening with the skull battered. She was murdered. Come home."
I swallowed with nothing to swallow. I started, "Where was - " and stopped. I swallowed again. "I'll leave - "
"When will you get here?"
"How do I know? Noon, one o'clock." "Very well." He hung up.

It wasn't noon, and it wasn't one o'clock, when I used my key on the door of the old brownstone on West 35th Street. It was five minutes to two. The plane had floated around above a fog bank for half an hour before landing at Idlewild - I mean Kennedy International Airport. I put my bag down and was taking my coat off when Fritz appeared at the end of the hall, from the kitchen, and came.
"Grace a Dieu," he said. "He called the airport. You know how he is about machines. I've kept it hot. Shad roe, fines herbes, no parsley."
"I can use it. But I - "

==> A roar came. "Archie!" <==
I went to the open door to the dining room, which is across the hall from the office. At the table, Wolfe was putting cheese on a wafer.
"Nice day," I said. "You don't want to smell the herbs again so I'll eat in the kitchen with the Times. The one on the plane was the early edition."
We get two copies of the Times, one for Wolfe, who has a tray breakfast in his room, and one for me. I proceeded to the kitchen, and there was my Times, propped on the rack, on the little table where I always eat breakfast. Even when I'm away for a week on some errand Fritz probably puts it there every morning. He would. I sat and got it and looked for the headline, but in a moment was interrupted by Fritz with the platter and a hot plate. I helped myself and took a bite of the roe and a piece of crusty roll dabbed in the sauce, which is one of Fritz's best when he leaves the parsley out.
The details were about as scanty as in the early edition. Susan Brooke's corpse had been found shortly before nine o'clock Monday evening in a room on the third floor of a building on 128th Street, a walk-up of course, by a man named Dunbar Whipple, who was on the staff of the Rights of Citizens Committee. Her skull had been crushed by repeated blows. I already knew that much. Also I already knew what the late city edition added: that Susan Brooke had been a volunteer worker for the ROCC, and she had lived with her widowed mother in a Park Avenue apartment; and that Dunbar Whipple was twenty-three years old and was the son of Paul Whipple, an assistant professor of anthropology at Columbia University. One thing I had not actually known but could have guessed if I had put my mind on it: the police and the district attorney's office had started an investigation.
When the roe and sauce and rolls were where they belonged, and some salad, I refilled my coffee cup and took it to the office. Wolfe was at his desk, tapping his nose with a pencil, scowling at a crossword puzzle. I went to my desk, sat, and sipped coffee. After a while he switched the scowl to me, realized I hadn't earned it, and erased it.

Dunbar blurted at Wolfe, "What did you do? What did you do?"
Whipple shook his head at him. "Take it easy, son." He twisted around to look at the chair, saw it there, and sat. He looked at Wolfe. "You know what happened."
Wolfe nodded. "I have read the paper. Mr. Whipple. Many people in distress have sat in that chair. Sometimes I cannot supply advice or services, but I can always supply food. I doubt if you have eaten. Have you?"
"We're not here to eat!" Dunbar blurted. "What did you do?"
"I'll talk, son," Whipple told him. To Wolfe: "I know what you mean. I made him eat a little just now, on the way here. I felt I had to tell him what I asked you to do, and he wants to know what you said. You understand that he's - uh - overwrought. As you said, in distress. Of course I would like to know too, what you did. You understand that."
==> "Yes. I myself have done nothing." Wolfe leaned back, drew in air through his nose, all there was room for, which was plenty, and let it out through his mouth. "Archie. Tell them." <==
Dunbar blurted at me, "You're Archie Goodwin."
"Right." I moved my eyes to Whipple. "Did you tell him exactly what you asked Mr. Wolfe to do?"
"Yes. Exactly."
"Okay. A friend of mine named Lily Rowan invited Miss Brooke to lunch, and I was there. At lunch nothing was discussed but the ROCC. After lunch Miss Rowan gave Miss Brooke a check for a thousand dollars for the ROOC and asked her some questions about herself. Nothing cheeky, just the usual line. Miss Brooke mentioned that she had worked for the Parthenon Press and at the UN,

 and I spent three days checking that, mostly at the UN. I found nothing that you could use, and yesterday I took a plane to Chicago and drove to Racine, Wisconsin. At Racine I talked with two men who had known Miss Brooke and her family, a newspaperman and a private detective, and got no hint of anything you could use. You wanted to find out what was wrong with her. Correct?"

"Yes. He's at the district attorney's office now.
"His name, please?"
"Why?"
Wolfe turned a palm up. "Must I get it from the morning paper?"
Cramer turned both palms up. "Harold R. Oster. A Negro. Counsel for the Rights of Citizens Committee."
==> Wolfe's eyes came to me. "Archie, get Mr. Parker." <==
I got the phone. I didn't have to consult the book for either of the numbers, office or home, of Nathaniel Parker, the member of the bar. Knowing he was often at his office after hours I tried that one first and got him. Wolfe took his phone, and I stayed on.
"Mr. Parker? I need some information confidentially. You will not be quoted. Do you know a lawyer named Harold R. Oster?"


"I know of him. I've met him. He's with the Rights of Citizens Committee. He handles civil rights cases."

"Yes. How efficient would he be as counsel for a man charged with murder?" "Oh." Pause. "Dunbar Whipple?"
"Yes."
"Are you on that?"
"I merely want information."
"You usually do. Well... confidentially, I would say no. He has ability, no doubt of that, but in my opinion he might take a wrong line in a case where - a Negro killing a white woman. I mean charged with killing her. If I were Dunbar Whipple, I would want a different kind of man. Of course I may be completely wrong, but - "
==> "Enough, Mr. Parker, wrong or not. Thank you. You won't be quoted." Wolfe hung up and turned. "Archie. Did Dunbar Whipple kill Susan Brooke?" <==
I know him so well. Anyone might suppose he was showing off to Cramer, showing him how eccentric and unique he was, but no. He merely wanted to know what I would say. If we had been alone I would have told him that one would get him ten that Dunbar was innocent, but with Cramer there I preferred to skip the odds.
"No," I said.
He nodded. "Get Mr. Whipple."
Before turning to the phone I shot a glance at Cramer. Chin down, eyes narrowed, and lips tight, he was glued to Wolfe. He knows him fairly well too, and he suspected what was coming. It would have cramped Wolfe's style a little if Whipple hadn't been at home, but he was.
He answered the phone. I started to tell him that Mr. Wolfe wanted to speak to him, but Wolfe was at his phone and cut in.

Wolfe pinched his nose. "I believe I have never told you of an experience I had years ago at a place in West Virginia. I wanted to leave and come home, and I wanted a certain favor from a certain man. A young colored man made it possible for me to realize both desires. His name was Paul Whipple. I hadn't seen him since until ten days ago - no, eleven. Now I'll even the score."

The hell you will. You can't possibly know that Dunbar Whipple didn't kill that girl. The only way you could know that would be if you thought you knew who did kill her."
"I haven't the slightest idea who killed her."
"I don't believe you. It's obvious that when Goodwin was checking on her he dug up something that you intend to use to pull one of your goddam fancy stunts. You're not going to. I told you that if you had taken him on Goodwin would have been wanted downtown, and now I'm telling you that I'm taking you too. To the district attorney." He rose. "If you want it done right, you're under arrest as material witness. Come on."
==> Wolfe, in no hurry, put his hands on the desk rim to push his chair back, arose, and got the edge of his vest between thumbs and forefingers to pull it down. "We shall of course stand mute and get bail tomorrow. May we have two minutes to call Mr. Parker? Get him, Archie." <==
I slanted my eyes up at Cramer, waiting politely for permission, since I was under arrest. He stood and breathed for ten seconds. He spoke. "You told Whipple that the charge against his son is unfounded. Let's hear you reply to what I said, that if you say Dunbar Whipple didn't kill her you think you know who did."
"I did reply. I have no idea who killed her." "Then why didn't he?"
"I am not obliged to account for a conclusion I have formed. But I tell you on my word of honor - a phrase I respect, as you know - that the conclusion has no evidential basis. I know nothing of the circumstances that led to the death of Susan Brooke that you don't know; indeed, I know much less than you do. I offer a suggestion. I am now committed to act in the interest of Mr. Whipple, I would like to proceed without delay, and I would rather not spend tonight and part of tomorrow in custody, mute or not. I'm going to ask Mr. Goodwin to type a full report, with all conversations verbatim, of his investigation of Susan Brooke, and I offer to send you a copy of it, with his affidavit. That should satisfy you."
"What about you?"

"What about you?"

Dismiss me. All my knowledge of the matter will be contained in Mr. Goodwin's report. Still my word of honor."
"When will I get the report?"
==> "I can't say. How long will it take, Archie?" <==
"It depends," I told him. "If you want it all, every word, say forty hours. Three days and evenings. I talked with many people about many things. If you want only what could possibly be relevant, ten or twelve hours should do it. The affidavit could cover it."
"Tomorrow afternoon," Cramer said. "By five o'clock." "Maybe, but no guarantee."
He regarded Wolfe, opened his mouth and closed it again, about-faced, and was going. Wolfe raised his voice to tell his back, "We are under arrest!"
"Balls," Cramer said without stopping. As I got up and went to the hall to see that he was outside when the door shut, I was thinking that you couldn't blame him for being rude. He was facing the fact that they were slapping the big one on a man that Nero Wolfe had decided to take on. I didn't offer to help him with his hat and coat; it wouldn't have been appreciated. When he was out and the door shut I stepped back in the office. Wolfe was back in his chair, looking sour.
I went to my desk and sat. "At least twelve hours," I said. "I might as well be in jail."

"Not the first one, though I said 'if.' Come, Mr. Oster, let's be realistic. Yesterday at this hour a police inspector was sitting in that chair, and we talked at length. I believe that your client is in grave jeopardy unless we produce a substitute. Don't you?"
"Was it Cramer?"

 "Yes."
"That damned Cossack."
==> "Not by definition." Wolfe flipped it aside. "I won't press you for an answer; your reputation for acumen is answer enough." Vinegar, then butter. "Dunbar Whipple entered that apartment shortly after nine o'clock and remained there continuously until the police arrived some forty minutes later; he says so. The only feasible method of proving that Susan Brooke died before he arrived is to produce the person who killed her. Let's find him. The ROCC is not the place to look, certainly. Your report, Archie?" <==
I got it from a drawer. He asked, "You have an extra copy?"
I nodded. "I made three."
"Give it to Mr. Oster. That, sir, is a complete report, omitting nothing that could possibly be pertinent, of the investigation of Susan Brooke undertaken by me at the request of Mr. Paul Whipple. I haven't studied it yet, but I shall. I suggest that you do the same. Any hint it contains, however slight, will of course be considered. But as soon as possible I must see - "
He stopped short. He slapped the desk blotter. "Confound it. I'm a ninny. I haven't asked you: have you in mind a ready and cogent defense?"
Oster was flipping the pages of the report. He looked up. "Not ... I wouldn't say ... not ready, no."

What?"
"I suggest that Mr. Whipple's extravagance should be ignored. Let's put it that the legal defense of Dunbar Whipple is in your hands, and the search for evidence to support that defense is in my hands. I knew we would clash, and we have. There are no casualties. Oblige me by sitting down. Naturally I expected, and expect, you to be present at the conference tomorrow evening. If you wish to object to anything I say or do, you have a tongue. You have indeed. I don't wonder that you tried to drum me out; I'm difficult, though not really impossible. If you wish to debate it with Mr. Whipple, you can do so later." He looked at the clock. "No doubt you have information for me, and suggestions, and in less than half an hour it will be dinnertime. If you and Mr. Whipple will dine with us, we'll have the evening for it. Wild duck with Vatel sauce - wine vinegar, egg yolk, tomato paste, butter, cream, salt and pepper, shallots, tarragon, chervil, and peppercorns. Is any of those distasteful to you?"
Oster said no.
"To you, Mr. Whipple?" Whipple said no.
==> "Tell Fritz, Archie." <==
I got up and went to the kitchen. It was a good thing neither of them had said yes, for Fritz was well along with the sauce, as Wolfe had known he would be. He didn't welcome my news.
Not that he didn't like guests at meals, but he thought there wouldn't be enough duck. I told him it would do Wolfe good to go easy for a change, returned to the office, and found that Oster was back in the red leather chair, evidently on speaking terms, and Wolfe had a pen and pad of paper, taking notes. I interrupted to ask about drinks, got orders for a martini and a vodka on the rocks, and went to the kitchen to fill them.
Only two kinds of guests ever dine at that table: (a) men for whom Wolfe has personal feelings - there are eight altogether, and only two of them live in or near New York - and (b) people who are involved in his current problem. With both kinds he makes a point of steering the table talk to subjects that he thinks the guests will be interested in; for him, as he once remarked, a guest is a jewel on

cushion of hospitality - a little fancy maybe, but a fine sentiment. As Fritz was serving the mussels I was wondering what it would be for those two. It was William Shakespeare. After the skimpy portions of mussels, in white wine with creamed butter and flour, had been commented on, Wolfe asked them if they had read the book by Rowse. They hadn't. But they were interested in Shakespeare? Oh, yes. Not many lawyers or professors would dare to say no. Of course they were familiar with Othello? They were. I cocked an eye at Wolfe. Surely it wasn't very tactful, with those dinner guests to deliberately drag Othello in.

The evening didn't start off any too well. When four or more are coming for an after-dinner session I equip a portable bar in the kitchen and wheel it into the office, and it was there, by the bookshelves to the left of the safe, when the first one arrived; but twenty minutes later, when they had all come and been seated, and Wolfe entered, I had made no sales. That was remarkable. Out of eight people, at nine o'clock in the evening, you would expect at least two or three to be thirsty enough or bushed enough to want a drink, but they all said no. It couldn't have been because of my manners, offering to serve people of an inferior race. First, two of them were white, and second, when I consider myself

 superior to anyone, as I frequently do, I need a better reason than his skin.
The seating was segregated, not by color but by sex. Wolfe had told me to put Whipple, the client, in the red leather chair, and since he had arrived before Oster there had been no clash.
In the front row of yellow chairs Oster was at the far end from me, then Henchy, Ewing, public relations, and Faison, fund-raising. In the back row were Rae Kallman, Maud Jordan, and Beth Tiger. It was my first sight of the Misses Kallman and Tiger. Kallman, who had more lipstick than necessary on her full lips, would probably be plump in a few years, but now she was just nice and curvy. Tiger was one of those specimens who cannot be properly introduced by details. I'll mention that her skin was about the color of an old solid-gold bowl Wolfe has in his room which he won't allow Fritz to clean, that - if she had been Cleopatra instead of what's-her-name I wouldn't have missed that movie, and that I had a problem with my eyes all evening, since with a group there I am supposed to watch expressions and movements. It was especially difficult because Miss Tiger, nearest me in the back row, was at an angle to my right. My mistake.
==> It was ten past nine when I buzzed the kitchen on the house phone to tell Wolfe they were all there, and in a minute he entered, circled around Whipple to his desk, and stood while I pronounced names. To each one he nodded, his usual eighth-of-an-inch nod, then turned to me and demanded, "The refreshments, Archie?" <==
"Offered," I said, "and declined."
"Indeed. Beer for me, please." As I rose he turned to the client. "Mr. Whipple, that evening at Upshur Pavilion you took ginger ale."
Whipple's eyes widened. "You remember that?"
"Certainly. But the other day you had a martini. Will it be ginger ale now? I'm
having beer and invite you to join me - to your taste." "All right, I will. Scotch and soda."

Henchy nodded. "Five or ten minutes after six."
"Was anyone here present, besides you, at the conference?"
"Yes. Mr. Ewing, Mr. Faison, and Mr. Oster."
"Did any of you four leave the room after half past five, before the conference ended?"
Adam Ewing exploded. "This is poppycock! You grilling us!"
==> Wolfe regarded him. "I believe, sir, you are in charge of what is called 'public relations' for your organization. Surely it is in its interest, if Dunbar Whipple is innocent, to have the murderer exposed and dealt with as soon as possible. You don't want it to be someone now in this room, and neither do I. I have contributed to the Rights of Citizens Committee - how much, Archie?" <==
"Fifty dollars a year for the past seven years." I slanted a glance at Miss Tiger to see if she was impressed. Apparently not.
"But that telephone call is a vital point, and if Miss Brooke made it I must know who might have learned about it. Mr. Oster, I told you that if you wished to object to anything I say, you have a tongue. Do you object to this?"
"No," the lawyer said. "I think it's immaterial, but this isn't a courtroom." "It may be immaterial. Shall I repeat the question, Mr. Henchy?"
"No. I'll answer for myself. I was in the room continuously until the conference ended."
"I wasn't," Cass Faison said. I had him in profile, and the light glancing off his black cheek gave it a high gloss. "I had an appointment and left about a quarter

 irresistible. But he didn't?"
"No, he didn't. I'm glad he didn't." "Why glad?"
"Because I know - I think I would have gone down and put my fingerprints on the club."
"Pfui. You think he would have let you?"
"He wouldn't have known. He would have stayed in my room."
==> "Then I'm as glad as you are that he didn't go to you. This job is knotty enough without that. Archie, the glasses are empty." <==
As I went to the bar for a bottle of beer and took it to him, a couple of them made remarks that can be skipped, and Miss Kallman got up to help. They all took refills except Miss Tiger. Her glass was still two-thirds full, with the ice gone, but she didn't even want more ice.
By the time the others had been served, Henchy had downed most of his refill, and I put the bourbon bottle on the stand between him and Oster, and he emptied his glass, picked up the bottle, and poured. It was twelve-year-old Big Sandy, which is worth stealing a little time for. As for me, I went to the kitchen and got a glass of milk. I would like to be loyal to Miss Tiger and say that what she didn't want I didn't want, but the truth is that ever since the time I missed an important point because I had had four martinis to be sociable I have limited myself to one dose when I'm working. When I returned to the office with the milk, Oster was speaking:
"... so I didn't object, but it was immaterial. What does it matter who knew of the phone call or the message? Say I saw the message on Whipple's desk. I would know that he probably wouldn't be at the apartment until nine o'clock, but I would also know that Susan wouldn't either. Therefore I wouldn't go there at eight o'clock, to see her or kill her before Whipple came. Therefore it's immaterial."
Wolfe nodded and put his glass down. "Obviously, if it were that simple, but it isn't. The telling point is that if you saw the message you knew it was fairly certain that Whipple wouldn't arrive until around nine o'clock. During the two

"Will you do so?"

Yes, of course."
"I've talked with Magnus," Oster said. "So have the police, naturally. You won't get anything conclusive, one way or the other."
Wolfe was swallowing beer. It was turning into a big beer night, three bottles instead of the usual one or two. He put the glass down and licked his lips. "There's always a chance of a hint, and Mr. Goodwin is good at hints. I can't say about you, but the police were surely satisfied to have it that Miss Brooke made that call, and I am not. If there's any - "
==> The phone rang, and I turned and got it. "Nero Wolfe's resi - " "Saul, Archie. I've got a slice of maybe bacon." <==
"We could use some. We have company. Hold it."
"Sure."
I pressed a button, rose, detoured around the chairs, passing only eight inches from Miss Tiger's shoulder, went to the kitchen, and got at the phone on my breakfast table.
"Goodwin speaking."
"You sound more like Lieutenant Rowcliff." "I do not. I don't stutter. Well?"

He sure could. Me, I would have just said yes. I happen to prefer a straightforward lie to one with curves, but I admit it's a question of personal taste. It isn't that he wants to have an out; he simply likes them fancy.
She looked at me, saw only a manly truth-loving phiz, returned to Wolfe, and took a skip.
"Peter Vaughn," she said with feeling. "I owe this to him." Another skip. "My husband." Still another. "Do the police know?"
"Not yet." Wolfe opened a drawer and took out a document. "I suppose they'll

I arose and took the document and handed it to her and stayed on my feet, since she would soon need a pen.
"Read it," Wolfe said. "I made it as brief as possible." She was a slow reader. I thought she would never finish the first page, and she took even longer with the second. Finally she looked up. "If you think I'm going to sign this," she said, "you're crazy."
"You won't even consider it?" "I will not."
"Get Mr. Cramer, Archie." "Who is Mr. Cramer?"
"A police inspector."

"A police inspector."
I was at my desk, starting to dial.
"Don't do that!" she yelled. I could use a nicer word, but a yell is a yell. As I went on dialing, she bounced out of the chair, to me, and grabbed my arm and jerked. She turned to Wolfe and presumably was glaring; her back was to me.
"I won't squabble," Wolfe snapped. "You will sign that statement, now, or you will stay until Mr. Cramer comes." He turned his head and roared. "Saul!"
The door opened and Saul was there. "This woman prevented Archie from making a telephone call," Wolfe told him. "Don't let her do it again."

Three men and one poor little woman. Saul advanced. I lifted the receiver, which I had cradled. "Don't," she said. She touched my arm. "Please don't. I'll sign it." The document was on the floor, where it had dropped when she bounced. Saul picked it up and handed it to her. She went to the chair and sat, and I took her a pen. The little stand beside the chair was mainly for signing checks, but it would do for signing statements too.
"All three copies," Wolfe said, and I got the two carbons from a drawer and took them to her. As she did each one I took it and gave the signature a look. It

 slanted up, which I understand means something, I forget what. I went to my desk and put them in the locked drawer. Saul went over to a chair by the bookshelves.
Dolly Brooke said, begging, not telling, "My husband mustn't know. The police mustn't know."

"I hope not. If you did, as long as I reserve that statement, I'll be withholding vital evidence; and I prefer to reserve it, tentatively. You say the police mustn't know. On the contrary, they probably must, sooner or later; but I would like to postpone it until I can name the murderer, and it's possible that by then your movements that evening will be of no consequence. I have - "
"You won't tell them?"
"Not immediately. I have a question that is of consequence. I want you to concentrate on it all your powers of observation and memory. If you didn't kill her, the person who did left the apartment and building within minutes, perhaps seconds, of the time you arrived. Possibly as you arrived. He may have been in the third-floor hall, leaving, as you mounted the stairs, and retreated to the floor above, remained there until you departed, and left the building soon after you. Or, bolder or stupider, he may have passed you on the stairs, descending as you mounted. Search your memory. Whom did you see, either while you were in the building, or leaving it after you did, as you stood and watched the entrance?"
"I didn't see anybody." "No one at all?"

==> Yes. No one in the building or leaving it." Wolfe's head turned. "What about it, Archie?" <==
"Possible," I said. "Granting that she didn't enter the apartment, that she stayed in the hall, it was only about twenty minutes. It was between eight-thirty and nine, when people are set for the evening, at the movies or at home or somewhere. It's quite possible."
"Pfui." He had looked at the clock a couple of times, and he looked again. Two minutes to four. He pushed his chair back, rose, and scowled down at her. "You're in a pickle, madam. If you killed her, you're doomed. If you didn't, your chance of escaping a painful and perilous ordeal depends wholly on my competence and wit and luck." He headed for the door, but a step short of it he stopped and wheeled to say, "And Mr. Goodwin's." He turned and went. The sound of the elevator came.
She was looking at me, and from her eyes it seemed likely that she was deciding to go feminine again. Her mouth opened and closed. Finally she said, "You're Mr. Goodman."
I said, "Are you crazy?" She stared.
"Look," I said, "if the best you can do is to tell me what my name is and get it wrong, you may not be crazy but you're pooped. There's absolutely nothing you can do except sign off and stay off." I stood up. "Since I brought you, I suppose I should take you home, but I'm expecting a caller. I'll see you to a taxi." I moved, toward the door, and she got up and came. Saul gave me a wink as I passed. It's his one bad habit.

I should have known better. As I sat at my breakfast table in the kitchen Wednesday morning, disposing of corn muffins and shirred eggs with sherry and chives, my eyes were on the Times propped on the rack, but they were sharing attention with my ears. If the house phone buzzed it would be Wolfe, in his room, to tell me to come up for instructions. I should have known better. His line

out getting answers to questions while brushing his teeth had been merely a way to sneak up on automation. I don't say he had never got an idea while brushing his teeth, but if so it was when we were on something urgent. There was nothing urgent about this. What the hell, Dunbar Whipple was safe and sound, getting three meals a day - though it would have been different if Wolfe had been eating the meals. That would have been urgent.
That Wednesday was about as unsatisfactory a day as I have ever spent, speaking professionally. Wolfe's taking time out from a job was nothing new, far from it, but always before I had had the satisfaction of poking him; as I said, that was one of my main functions. Now I couldn't. I was on record that nobody could do anything, and that day nobody did, for sure. The only action performed or word spoken that had anything to do with the case came around five o'clock when Wolfe was up in the plant rooms fiddling with the orchids. The phone rang, and I said aloud, "Automation again." I lifted the receiver.
==> "Nero Wolfe's office, Archie Goodwin speaking." <==
"This is Peter Vaughn. I'm calling now because I knew Wolfe wouldn't be there. I can't take him."
"Neither can I. Today. Are you up and dressed?"
"Sure. I slept seventeen hours. I wanted to know, have you seen her?"
"Yes, and so has Mr. Wolfe. She spent an hour here Yesterday afternoon. Relax. She admits it as you told it. Naturally you want to know if we have passed it on. We haven't. For the present we're saving it. I wouldn't advise you to drop in on her for tea. She'd probably put vinegar in it, or something worse. By the way, I meant to ask you yesterday, have you ever heard her do imitations? People's voices?"
"Yes, often. She's good at it. She was on the stage, you know."

Wolfe straightened up and cocked his head. "Mr. Cramer. I have no information for you. Don't explode; let me explain. We - I am including Mr. Goodwin - have seen and spoken with Mr. Vaughn twice. Last Friday evening he was here for less than an hour with Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Brooke. None of them gave us any information that you did not already have. Day before yesterday, Tuesday morning, he came alone and spoke with Mr. Goodwin, again for less than an hour. I wasn't present, but Mr. Goodwin has reported to me. Mr. Vaughn had disclosed certain facts you don't know about, but it is my considered opinion that they have no bearing on his death. There are - "
"That's for me to say."

It is not. There are two points. First, in our talks with Mr. Vaughn, Mr. Goodwin and I were the agents of Mr. Oster, and therefore the communications were privileged. Second, even if they weren't privileged we would reserve them, because we have reason to believe that they have no connection with his death. If the event should prove us wrong we would of course be called to account. However -"
"I'm calling you to account here and now."
==> "Pfui. You know you can't. However, we'll give you one bit of information, privileged or not, which probably is connected with his death. He called on the telephone shortly after five o'clock yesterday and spoke with Mr. Goodwin. Archie, the possibly relevant portion of the conversation, beginning with his saying that he might have something to tell you later." <==
I told it, to Cramer. "He said, 'Listen, something I wasn't going to mention, but I guess I will. I may have something important to tell you a little later. Can I get you there this evening?' I said, 'Yes, but I'm here now. Shoot.' He said, 'Well, I - No, I won't. I wouldn't want to - No. Maybe I just imagined it, but I'm going to find out. I may ring you this evening.' I said, 'How are you going to find out?' He said, 'Oh, ask a few questions. I wish I hadn't mentioned it. It's probably nothing.'"
"Who was he - "
"No," Wolfe snapped. "Mr. Goodwin is my agent. Archie, did he give you any hint of whom he was going to question or about what?"
"No."
"Have you any notion about it?"

It is not. There are two points. First, in our talks with Mr. Vaughn, Mr. Goodwin and I were the agents of Mr. Oster, and therefore the communications were privileged. Second, even if they weren't privileged we would reserve them, because we have reason to believe that they have no connection with his death. If the event should prove us wrong we would of course be called to account. However -"

"No."
"Have you any notion about it?"
It was obvious he wanted another no, so I supplied it. He turned to Cramer. "Nor have I; but I suspect that his contemplated action led to his death, and so we report the conversation. If you can learn whom he expected to question before I do, you'll get the murderer."
"Damn you," Cramer said, icy again. "Damn you. You already know."
"I do not. I haven't even a conjecture. I have some information you don't have, but I am convinced that it has no bearing on the identity of the murderer. I have

t even about his coming to you?"
"No. And I won't. You must excuse me. It has been painful, telling you this.
Very painful." He went.
I was on my feet, but Wolfe shook his head at me and I stayed put. My stepping to the hall for a look after the sound came of the front door closing was automatic, a habit ever since the day a bozo shut it from inside and stood near the open office door for half an hour, listening to us discuss his affairs.
I stepped back in. "Do I bother to sit?"
==> A corner of Wolfe's mouth was up. "You know, Archie, the most revealing manifestation of your self-esteem is not an action but an exclusion. You never crow. Nevertheless, accept my compliments." <==
"With pleasure. I won't deduct the twenty-two bucks. Do I sit down?" "No. Bring them."
"Now?"
"Yes. Mr. Cramer might get to them at any moment."
"It's a quarter to three. Even if I deliver them in half an hour, which is doubtful, you can't possibly do them in forty-five minutes."
"I know I can't, confound it. I owe all this to that outlandish trip to Kanawha Spa."

Wolfe slanted his head back. "Mr. Oster. I don't ask you to sit because I don't want you to. You will join the others in the front room. I am no longer acting in cooperation with you; henceforth my only commitment is to Mr. Paul Whipple. With me your status is now, to use a cant term, that of a murder suspect." He pointed. "That door."


Oster made a noise, part snort and part snarl. He sat.
"That crap," he said. "The Great White Whosis. I'm a member of the bar, and what are you?"
==> Wolfe regarded him. "I really can't blame you. If I were a Negro I would have been locked up long ago - or I would be dead. You actually believe that your skin color and mine are factors in my treatment of you. Pfui. I'm not a troglodyte. Archie, the relevant portion of your telephone conversation with Mr. Vaughn yesterday afternoon." <==
I recited it for them as I had for Cramer, but slower and emphasizing "important," and adding at the end that he hadn't rung again. Henchy was frowning at me, concentrating. Oster was looking skeptical, but he was getting it. Wolfe spoke.
"Those were the last words, for us, from Mr. Vaughn. 'It's probably nothing.' But unfortunately for him it wasn't. It's a conclusion, more than an assumption, that he was going to see again someone he had seen earlier, or at least explore some suspicion resulting from an earlier contact. It's possible that that contact had not been at your office, but I know of none other he might have made relevant to the fate of Susan Brooke, and I doubt if the police do. It's also a conclusion, not lightly to be abandoned, that he was killed by the person who killed Miss Brooke. Do you reject that, Mr. Oster?"
"Reject it, no. If he said what Goodwin says he did."
"For me that is not moot. If it is for you, it will be a soliloquy. Are you willing to
tell me what Mr. Vaughn said to you yesterday, and what you said to him?" "He said nothing, and neither did I."

"No. Next question, where was I last evening? If you have a right to ask any questions at all, which I don't concede, you have a right to ask that. I'll answer it by saying that I can't produce witnesses for the entire evening and night. I wouldn't, for you, but anyway I couldn't."
"Few people could. Now, sir, I'm sure you would like this to be as brief as possible, and you can help. While I talk with Mr. Henchy you can explain to the others - "
"I'm staying right here."
"No. You're leaving, if not the house, the room. You - "
"I'm staying in this chair."
==> Wolfe's head turned. "Archie, you'll need Saul to help remove him; he's of a size. Since it must be done by force, put him out of the house." <==
"You wouldn't," Oster said.
I was up. "I have the build for it," I said, "but you'll be surprised to feel Saul Panzer in action. He's the Little White Whosis." I moved.
"Now wait a minute," Henchy said. "Harold, I don't like this. I don't think it's necessary." To Wolfe: "What were you going to say?"
"That Mr. Oster can describe the situation to the others, including what Mr. Vaughn said to Mr. Goodwin on the telephone. He can also learn if any of them have alibis - from eight o'clock last evening to two o'clock this morning - that can be verified." He turned to Oster. "Not difficult for a member of the bar."
I thought, He meant it, that their skin colors weren't factors. He was being as crusty with him as he would have been with a paleface. Oster thought he had

I turned and said, "Yes, sir. I was only remarking about the one single aspect of the party that struck me as worthy of remark. Was there any other?"
"No." He had straightened up.
"Then there's no argument. I might as well go on remarking about Miss Tiger. Two days ago I said there wasn't one sensible thing anybody could do. Now it's even worse; there's not even one unsensible thing."
"Confound it, don't sit there inventing grotesque words!"
"Shall I go?" Saul asked.
==> "No. When Archie exhausts inanity he may have a suggestion. I won't. It's hopeless. Whatever Vaughn saw or heard there yesterday is buried beyond recovery. One of those six people either killed him or knows who did, but that key to his identity is undiscoverable. There's another one somewhere, but a hundred men might not find it in a hundred days. Saul?" <==
"I'm sorry." "Archie?" "Sorry and sad."
He glared. "Two highly trained and highly skilled men, and what good are you? Go somewhere. Do something. Am I to sit here another evening, and go up to bed, contemplating frustration? Reflecting, in desperation, as I did day before yesterday on a diphthong?"
Saul and I exchanged glances. Our genius was going potty on us. To humor him I inquired, "A diphthong?"

Yes. Tenuous almost to nullity, it was unworthy of consideration. It still is. But I'm bereft, and it's a fact. Get Mr. Vaughn."

For half a second I thought he was worse than potty; then, realizing that there was a Mr. Vaughn who was still alive, and that diphthonp might be his hobby, I got at the phone. With his son not yet buried, Samuel Vaughn probably wouldn't be at Heron Manhattan, Inc., but I tried it on the chance, was told that he wasn't in today, and dialed his home number. He wasn't accessible until I made it clear that Nero Wolfe wanted to ask him a question - I didn't say about a diphthong - and in a couple of minutes I had him, and Wolfe took his phone.

"It isn't worth the trouble. I believe Mr. Goodwin has told you to command us if at any time you need information from here."
"He didn't say 'command,' but he said you'd reciprocate and I appreciate it. I like that 'command.' If you need more on this let me know."
Wolfe said he would, hung up, pushed the phone away as if he resented it, which he does, pushed his chair back, left it, walked over to the globe, twirled it, and focused on a spot near the center of the United States of America. In a minute he demanded, not turning, "Where the devil is Evansville?"

If you've got Indiana, at the bottom, on the Ohio River." Another ten seconds, and he turned. "How do you get there?" "Probably the quickest would be a plane to Louisville."
==> "I'd have to be back Monday morning for a little job," Saul said. "No, Archie will go. You're needed here. Archie, find - " <==
He stopped because I had turned to the phone and started dialing.

At ten minutes past two Friday morning I sat on a wooden chair at the end of a glasstopped desk in a room with two windows, being sized up by a cop. I wasn't exactly in the pink, after the day in New York, the plane ride to Louisville, and the three-hour drive in a rented car to Evansville, but since I now knew which diphthong it was, and I would sleep better after I got the answers to a few questions, and police headquarters is open all night, I had stopped at the hotel only long enough to sign in. I admit that as I sat I had to tell myself to keep my shoulders up.
The cop's name was Sievers, Lieutenant Sievers, an old pro with very little hair but plenty of jaw. He gave my New York State detective license a thorough look, handed it back, and frowned at me. "Archie Goodwin," he said. "Haven't I seen that name somewhere?"
"I hope not on a hot dodger. You may have seen the name of the man I work for, Nero Wolfe."

"Oh." He nodded. "That one. Yeah. How do you stand him?"
"I've asked myself that question a thousand times, and damned if I can answer it."
"Don't expect me to. What's your problem here?"
"Just a little information we need, about a man named Richard Ault, or I should

 preferred to handle his evening himself if he wasn't needed, so I taxied him to the Churchill and proceeded to 35th Street.
It was only eight-forty, but Wolfe was in the office with coffee, and that deserved a grin. Business was not to be mentioned at meals, so he had either started dinner early or speeded it up in order to be away from the table when I arrived. There was a hint of feeling in his look and voice as he greeted me, as there always is when I return safe and sound from a trip in longdistance machines. I stood in the middle of the rug and took a good stretch, and said, "My God, it's cold around here, much colder than down on the Ohio River. The warmth in this room is wonderful, even if I had no personal connection with its production. I admit that the rapid advance of automation may result - "
"Sit down and report!"
I did so, verbatim. He didn't lean back and shut his eyes; there was no need to, since it was only the happy ending. When I finished by saying that we might be stuck for a week in town by Lieutenant Sievers he didn't bat an eye.
==> He picked up his coffee cup and emptied it and put it down. "Archie," he said, "I tender my apologies. I noticed that confounded diphthong Monday evening, and I could have sent you to Evansville then. Three wretched days." <==
"Yeah. Well, you finally got around to it. I accept the apology. It's too bad it's Friday night, the weekend, and some of them may not be available tomorrow, maybe none of them. I suggest that they deserve to be present, all the ROCC crowd, even Oster. Also Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Brooke. And why not Susan's mother? In a way, her more than anyone else. She was there in the house with Susan when Richard Ault shot himself on the porch. According to Drucker, she helped Susan give him the boot. She ought to - "
I stopped short. Wolfe asked, "What?"
"Nothing. But that's what you thought about the diphthong: it wasn't worth considering. What if she decided to get the mother too and picked tonight for it? That would be just great."
I swiveled. I didn't have Mrs. Matthew Brooke's number on the card and had to

 look in the book. I got it, and dialed, and sat and listened to fourteen buzzes, two more than my usual allowance. I don't dial wrong numbers, so I didn't try again but dialed another number, one that was on the card, and that time got an answer, a voice that I recognized, saying, "Mrs. Brooke's residence."
==> 'This is Archie Goodwin," I said, "at Nero Wolfe's office. Mr. Wolfe wants to ask Mrs. Matthew Brooke a question, and I just dialed her number and got no answer. I thought she might be with you. Is she?" <==
"No. What does he want to ask her?"
"Nothing very important, just a routine question, but it would help to have the answer now. Do you know where I can get her?"
"No, I don't. But it's odd...."
Silence. After five seconds of it I asked, "What's odd?" "I thought perhaps - Where are you?"
"Nero Wolfe's office."

"What for?"
"For God's sake! A stop-and-take on the goddam car!" "It isn't necessary. Saul."
"What do you mean, Saul? He can't - "
"He is covering Miss Jordan. As you know, he was told yesterday to inquire about her. He telephoned this morning shortly after you had reported from Evansville, and I told him to get Fred and Orrie and keep her under constant surveillance."
I returned to my pocket the key ring I had got out. Its collection included the key to the locked drawer from which I had been going to get the license number of the blue sedan. "Damn it, you might have told me."
==> "That's querulous, Archie." <==
"If that means peevish, I am. How would you feel or I feel or Cramer feel if she added another one to the list after we had her tagged? And you realize that any dimwit can lose a tail, even if it's Saul Panzer. You'd like to deliver her wrapped up, sure, so would I. But it would be nearly as good and a lot safer to ring him now and say the woman who killed Susan Brooke and Peter Vaughn is now somewhere in your territory in a blue Heron sedan with Mrs. Matthew Brooke and is going to kill her. The car's number is here in the drawer."
He called me. He asked, merely wanting information, "Do you wish to do that?" "Of course I don't wish to!"
"Would Saul?"
"If he has lost her, yes. If he's still on her, no."
He turned a palm up. "Then it's simple. We determine our action or inaction by the extent of our confidence in Saul's craft and sagacity. Mine, though not

"You took the gun along."
She passed her tongue over her lips. "I'm not going to talk about that." "And you had it again this evening, for Mrs. Brooke. The same gun?"
"Of course. It was my husband's. He always carried it when he brought money from the bank for the payroll. I don't want to talk about that, I want to talk about Susan. She called me Maud, you know, and I called her Susan. Of course my Richard had called her Susan, he told me all about her, but I had never met her. I have two pictures of her that he had, one with him. I'm not sure you understand how I felt about her. I'm not saying I loved her because my Richard had, that wasn't it exactly, but I wanted to be close to her, I wanted to see her every day.

 Do you understand that?"
==> "I think I do. It's somewhat involved." Wolfe's eyes moved. "The kitchen extension, Archie." <==
I pressed a button and got up and went. As I passed Saul he winked. I'm going to talk him out of that some day. In the kitchen I sat at my breakfast table, pulled the phone over, and dialed. Cramer doesn't like to be called at his home number, but if I had rung Homicide South I would probably have got Rowcliff, and I didn't want to take the time and trouble to get him stuttering. After four buzzes a female voice I knew said hello, and I said, 'This is Archie Goodwin, Mrs. Cramer. May I speak to the inspector, please?"
She said she'd see, and in a minute there was a growl in my ear, "What do you want, Goodwin?"
"I'm in the kitchen. Mr. Wolfe needs help. The woman who killed Susan Brooke and Peter Vaughn is in the office with him, talking a blue streak, and won't stop. She has explained why she killed Susan, and now she's explaining - "
"Damn you, are you clowning?"
"I am not. I'm sick and tired of being accused of clowning by cops. This morning in Evansville, Indiana, a police lieutenant did, and I brought him - "

"All right, make it 'we' and 'us.' It's not my style either."
He shook his head. "It's a pickle." A corner of his mouth curled up. I stared and demanded, "What the hell are you smiling at?"
"The pickle. The alternative. You have made it clear that it would be futile to establish that the FBI killed that man. Very well, then we'll establish that they didn't."
"Good for us. And then?"
==> "We'll see." He turned a hand over. "Archie. We had nothing. The items Mr. Cohen gave us were mere trivia, offering not even a forlorn hope. Now, thanks to Mr. Cramer, we have a nut with meat in it, an unsolved murder in which the FBI is deeply involved, whether they committed it or not. An open challenge to ingenuity, to our talents if we have any. We need first to learn, assuredly, who killed that man. You saw Mr. Cramer's face and heard his tone. Is he really satisfied that it was the FBI?" <==
"Yes." "Justly?"
"He thinks so. Of course it appeals to him. He refers to them as that goddam outfit and that bunch of grabbers. After he learned about the three G-men being at the scene at the right time he probably let up on other possibilities, but he's a good cop, and if there had been any other lead that was at all hot he would have kept on it, and apparently he didn't. Also, if Althaus was there dead when they entered, why didn't they report it? Anonymously, of course, after they left. They might have preferred not to, but it's a fair question. Also the bullet. Not many murderers would have realized that it had gone on through to the wall and fallen to the floor, and found it and taken it. With an old pro like Cramer that would be a big point. So I guess you could say justly."
He was frowning at me. "Who is the Wragg Mr. Cramer mentioned?" "Richard Wragg. Top G-man in New York. Special agent in charge."

Does he know, or believe, that Althaus was killed by one of his men?"

VINCENT YARMACK, around 50, was another senior editor at "Tick-Tock". I include him because the piece by Althaus about the FBI had been his project.
It didn't look very promising for an approach. I considered the stage personality, but her whirl with Althaus had ended more than a year ago, and besides, a couple of previous experiences had taught me that actresses are better from the fifth or sixth row. The two editors would hang up. Father probably had nothing. Marian Hinckley would stiff-neck me. The best bet was mother, and it was her number I looked up and went to the booth to dial.
First, of course, to get her to the phone. To the female who answered I gave no name; I merely told her, in an official tone, to tell Mrs. Althaus that I was talking from a booth and an FBI man was with me and I must speak to her. It worked. In a couple of minutes another voice came.
"Who is this? An FBI man?" "Mrs. Althaus?"
"Yes."
==> "My name is Archie Goodwin. I'm not an FBI man. I work for Nero Wolfe, the private investigator. The FBI man is not here in the booth with me; he is with me because he is following me. Tailing me. He will follow me to your address, but that doesn't matter to me if it doesn't to you. I must see you - now, if possible. It will - " <==
"I am not seeing anybody."

know. You may have heard of Nero Wolfe. Have you?" "Yes."
"He has been told by a man he knows well that your son Morris was killed by an agent of the FBI. That's why I am being followed. And that's why I must see you. I can be there in ten minutes. Did you get my name? Archie Goodwin."
Silence. Finally: "You "know" who killed my son?"

"Yes."
"My name is Archie Goodwin. I'm not an FBI man. I work for Nero Wolfe, the private investigator. The FBI man is not here in the booth with me; he is with me because he is following me. Tailing me. He will follow me to your address, but that doesn't matter to me if it doesn't to you. I must see you - now, if possible. It will - "
"I am not seeing anybody."

know. You may have heard of Nero Wolfe. Have you?" "Yes."
==> "He has been told by a man he knows well that your son Morris was killed by an agent of the FBI. That's why I am being followed. And that's why I must see you. I can be there in ten minutes. Did you get my name? Archie Goodwin." <==
Silence. Finally: "You "know" who killed my son?"
"Not his name. I don't "know" anything. I only know what Mr. Wolfe has been told. That's all I can say on the phone. If I may make a suggestion, we think Miss Marian Hinckley should know about this too. Perhaps you could phone her and ask her to come, and I can tell both of you. Could you?"
"I could, yes. Are you a newspaper reporter? Is this a trick?"
"No. If I were this would be pretty dumb, you'd only have me bounced. I'm Archie Goodwin."
"But I don't..." Long pause. "Very well. The hallman will ask you for identification."

I told her of course, and hung up before she could change her mind.
When leaving the house I had decided that I would completely iguore the tail question, but I couldn't help it if my eyes, while scouting the street for an empty taxi, took notice of standing vehicles. However, when I was in and rolling, up Madison Avenue and then Park, I kept facing front. To hell with the rear.
It was a regulation Park Avenue hive in the Eighties - marquee, doorman hopping out when the taxi stopped, rubber runner saving the rug in the lobby - but it was Grade A, because the doorman did not double as hallman. When I showed the hallman, who was expecting me, my private investigator license he gave it a good look, handed it back, and told me 10B, and I went to the elevator. On the tenth floor I was admitted by a uniformed female who took my hat and coat, put them in a closet, and conducted me through an arch into a room even bigger than Lily Rowan's, where twenty couples can dance. I have a test for people with rooms that big - not the rugs or the furniture or the drapes, but the pictures on the walls. If I can tell what they are, okay. If all I can do is guess, look out; these people will bear watching. That room passed the test fine. I was

"Spell it, please?"
"Timothy Quayle! Q,U,A,Y,L,E!" "Mr. Wolfe is engaged. I'll see."
I went to the office door. "One of the names in my notebook. Timothy Quayle. Senior editor at "Tick-Tock" magazine. The hero type. He slugged a reporter who was annoying Marian Hinckley. She must have phoned him about you soon after I left."
"No," he growled.
"It's half an hour till dinner. Are you in the middle of a chapter?" He glowered at me. "Bring him."
==> I returned to the front, slid the bolt, and swung the door open, and he entered. As I was shutting the door he told me I was Archie Goodwin, and I conceded it, <==

 took care of his coat and hat, and led him to the office. Three steps in he stopped to glance around, aimed the glance at Wolfe, and demanded, "Did you get my name?"
Wolfe nodded. "Mr. Quayle."
He advanced to the desk. "I am a friend of Miss Marian Hinckley. I want to know what kind of a game you're playing. I want an explanation."
"Bah," Wolfe said.

He advanced to the desk. "I am a friend of Miss Marian Hinckley. I want to know what kind of a game you're playing. I want an explanation."
"Bah," Wolfe said.
"Don't bah me! What are you up to?"
"This is ridiculous," Wolfe said. "I like eyes at a level. If you can only blather at me, Mr. Goodwin will put you out. If you will take that chair, change your tone, and give me an acceptable reason why I should account to you, I may listen."
Quayle opened his mouth and shut it again. He turned his head to look at me, there on my feet, apparently to see if I was man enough. I would have liked it just as well if he had decided I wasn't, for after that night and day I would have welcomed an excuse to twist another arm. But he vetoed it, went to the red leather chair and sat, and scowled at Wolfe. "I know about you," he said. Not so blathery, but not at all sociable. "I know how you operate. If you want to hook Mrs. Althaus for some change, that's her lookout, but you're not going to drag Miss Hinckley in. I don't intend - "
==> "Archie," Wolfe snapped. "Put him out. Fritz will open the door." He pushed a button. <==
I stepped to about arm's length from the red leather chair and stood looking down at the hero. Fritz came, and Wolfe told him to hold the front door open, and he went.
Quayle's situation was bad. With me standing there in front of him, if he started to leave the chair I could get about any hold I wanted while he was coming up. But my situation was bad too. Removing a 180-pound man from a padded armchair is a problem, and he had savvy enough to stay put, leaning back. But his feet weren't pulled in enough. I started my hands for his shoulders, then dived and got his ankles and yanked and kept going, and had him in the hall, on his back, before he could even try to counter, and then the damn fool tried to turn to get hand leverage on the floor. At the front door I braked when Fritz got his arms

 and held them down.
"There's snow on the stoop," I said. "If I let you up and give you your hat and coat, just walk out. I know more tricks than you do. Right?"

Tailing on New York streets, if you know you have it and want to shake it and aren't a birdbrain, is a joke. There are a thousand dodges, and the tallee merely picks the one that fits the time and place. There on Tremont Avenue I moseyed along, glancing occasionally at my wristwatch and at the numbers on doors, until I saw an empty taxi coming. When it was thirty yards away I scooted between parked cars, flagged it, hopped in, told the hackie as I pulled the door shut, "Step on it," and saw Gregory Peck stare at me as we went by. The other one was across the street. We did seven blocks before a red light stopped us, so that was that. I admit I had kept an eye on the rear. I gave the driver the Grand Concourse address, and the light changed, and we rolled.


Some realty agency branch offices are upstairs, but that one was on the ground floor of an apartment building, of course one of the buildings it serviced. I entered. It was small, two desks and a table and a filing cabinet. A beautiful young lady with enough black hair for a Beatle was at the nearest desk, and when she smiled at me and asked if she could help me, I had to take a breath to keep my head from swimming. They should stay home during business hours. I told her I would like to see Mr. Odell, and she turned her beautiful head and nodded to the rear.
He was at the other desk. I had waited to see him before deciding on the approach, and one look was enough. Some men, after a hitch in the jug, even a short one, have got a permanent wilt, but not him. In size he was a peanut, but an elegant peanut. Fair-skinned and fair-haired, he was more than fair-dressed. His pin-stripe gray suit had set him, or somebody, back at least two Cs.
==> He left his chair to come, said he was Frank Odell, and offered a hand. It would have been simpler if he had had a room to himself; possibly she didn't know she was cooped up with a jailbird. I said I was Archie Goodwin, got out my case, and handed him a card. He gave it a good look, stuck it in his pocket, and said, "My goodness, I should have recognized you. From your picture in the paper." <==
My picture hadn't been in the paper for fourteen months, and he had been behind bars, but I didn't make an issue of it. "I'm beginning to show my years," I told him. "Can you give me a few minutes? Nero Wolfe has taken on a little job involving a man named Morris Althaus and he thinks you might be able to furnish some information."
He didn't bat an eye. No wilt. He merely said, "That's the man that was murdered."
"Right. Of course the police have been around about that. Routine. This is just a private investigation on a side issue."
"If you mean the police have been "here", they haven't. We might as well sit down." He moved to his desk, and I followed and took a chair at its end. "What's the side issue?" he asked.
"It's a little complicated. It's about some research he was doing at the time he was killed. You may know something about it if you saw him during that period

After I escorted her downstairs and into her car I went back up and had another cup of coffee. I would wait to call Wolfe until I was sure they had finished lunch. I sat and looked things over. I had slipped up on one point; I hadn't asked if Miss Dacos had been present when Morris Althaus and Frank Odell had talked with Mrs. Bruner in her office. Of course Miss Dacos could tell us, but it was the kind of detail that Wolfe expects me to cover, and I expect me to too. How good a guess was it that it was Sarah Dacos who had told the cops about the three men? Not good at all, unless she had dressed it up or down either for the cops or for Mrs. Bruner. She couldn't see them go to a car around the corner, and get the license number, from the window of Number 63. Then we could be getting corroboration, but for the first alternative, that the FBI killed him, not for the one we preferred. But so what, since it was no longer futile, according to Wolfe's program.
I remembered how, crossing Washington Square yesterday on my sightseeing trip, I had thought it was coincidence that Arbor Street was in the Village and Sarah Dacos lived in the Village. Now it might be more than coincidence; it

 might be some more cause and effect.
At three o'clock I went to Felix's office and called Lewis Hewitt's number. There's something wrong with the way the people in that palace handle phone calls. It took a good four minutes, but finally Wolfe's voice came.
==> "Yes. Archie?" <==
"Yes and no," I said, "but more yes than no. I'm at Rusterman's. Mrs. Bruner and I had lunch here. If you get here before six-thirty I can report before dinner. We might as well eat here because someone is coming at nine o'clock to discuss things."
"Coming there?"
"Yes, sir.
"Why? Why not the office?"
"It will be better here. Unless you want an attractive young woman practically sitting on your lap for a couple of hours with the radio going."

"They "looked" like it. They looked young, and - well, sort of athletic, and the way they walked."
"You said there were no peculiarities."
"I know I did. It wasn't - I wouldn't call it "peculiarities"." She bit her lip. "I

 knew you would ask me this. I think I ought to admit - I think the main reason I told her that was because I knew how she felt about the FBI, I had heard her talking about that book, and I thought she would like - I mean, that would agree with how she felt about them. I don't like to admit this, Mr. Wolfe, of course I don't. I know how it sounds. I hope you won't tell Mrs. Bruner."
==> "I'll tell her only if it suits a purpose." Wolfe picked up his cup, drank, put the cup down, and looked at me. "Archie?" <==
"Maybe one or two little points." I looked at her, and she looked back. The hazel eyes seemed darker when they were straight at you. "Of course," I said, "the cops have asked you about the last time you spoke with Althaus. When was it?"
"Three days before - before that Friday. Tuesday morning, in the hall, just a minute or two. Just by accident."
"Did he tell you he was doing a piece on the FBI?"
"No. He never talked to me about his work."
"When was the last time you were with him - for dinner, for anything?"

"The hell we haven't. We have someone who had some reason for thinking they were G-men and is saving it. That will be pie for Cramer."
"No. It's our pie. We'll give Mr. Cramer Miss Dacos only when we have her ourselves, if at all." He pushed his chair back. "Get it out of her. Tomorrow. I'm tired. We're going home and to bed."

At 10:35 Saturday morning I used a key on the door of 63 Arbor Street, ascended two flights of wooden stairs, used another key, and entered the apartment that had been Morris Althaus's.
I was following my own approach to the problem of getting it out of Sarah Dacos. I admit it was roundabout, especially in view of the fact that time was short, but it was a better stab at getting results than persuading her to go to the Flamingo for an evening of dancing. The fact that time was short had been made publicly evident by an item on the twenty-eighth page of the morning paper, which I had read at my breakfast table in the kitchen. It was headlined FINGERS CROSSED? and said:
==> The members of the Ten for Aristology, one of the most exclusive of New York's gourmet groups, evidently do not believe that history repeats itself. Lewis Hewitt, capitalist, socialite, orchid fancier, and aristologist, will entertain the group at dinner at his home at North Cove, Long Island, on Thursday evening, January 14. The menu will be chosen by Nero Wolfe, the well-known private investigator, and the food will be prepared by Fritz Brermer, Mr. Wolfe's chef. Mr. Wolfe and Archie Goodwin, his confidential assistant, will be present as guests. <==
That arrangement arouses memory of another occasion when Mr. Brenner cooked a dinner for the Ten for Aristology, and Mr. Wolfe and Mr. Goodwin were guests, at the home of Benjamin Schriver, the shipping magnate. It occurred on April 1, 1958, and one of the Ten, Vincent Pyle, head of a Wall Street brokerage firm, was poisoned with arsenic in his portion of the first course, served to him by Carol Annis, who was subsequently convicted of first- degree murder.


Yesterday a "Times" reporter, remembering that former occasion, telephoned Mr. Hewitt and asked him if any of the Ten for Aristology (aristology means science of dining) had shown any reluctance to attend the affair next Thursday, and Mr. Hewitt said no. When the reporter asked him if he would keep his fingers crossed he said, "How can I? I couldn't handle my knife and fork."
It will certainly be an excellent meal.

"It's a take-off of the last four lines of the second stanza of Keats's 'Ode on a Grecian Urn.' It's sort of clever, but no one should monkey with Keats. Escamillo, you're a pretty good detective and you dance like an angel, and you have other outstanding qualities, but you will never be a highbrow. Come and read Keats to me."
I told her she was too jejune, hung up, slipped the photograph back in my pocket, and went out and took my fifth taxi in five hours. The client could afford it.
It was five minutes to two when I put my hat and coat on the rack in the hall, went to the door of the dining room, told Wolfe, who was at the table, that it looked and felt like snow, and proceeded to the kitchen. I don't join Wolfe when

 I arrive in the middle of a meal; we agree that for one man to hurry with meat or fish while the other dawdles with pastry or cheese is bad for the atmosphere. Fritz put things on my breakfast table and brought what was left of the baked bluefish, and I asked him how he was getting on with the menu for next Thursday's blowout.
==> "I'm not discussing that," he said. "I am not discussing anything, Archie. He was in my room for more than an hour before lunch, talking with the television on loud. If it is so dangerous I will not talk at all." <==
I told him we should be back to normal by the time the shad roe started coming, and he threw up his hands and said good God in French.
When I finished and went to the office Wolfe was standing over by the globe, turning it and scowling at it. The man who gave him that globe, the biggest one I have ever seen, couldn't have known what a big help it would be. Whenever a situation gets so ticklish that he wishes he were somewhere else, he can walk over to the globe and pick spots to go to. Wonderful. As I entered he asked if I had anything, and when I nodded he went to his desk and I turned on the radio, took a yellow chair around near his elbow, and reported. It didn't take long, since there had been no conversation to speak of, just the action. I didn't mention the phone call to Lily Rowan because it had been purely personal. Having read the poetry twice, he handed the photograph back to me and said she had an ear for meter.
"I told you she wasn't a sap," I said. "Pretty neat, doing that with the last four lines of the second stanza of Keats's 'Ode on a Grecian Urn.'"
His eyes narrowed at me. "How the deuce do you know that? You don't read Keats."
I shrugged. "Back in Ohio in my boyhood days. As you know, I have quite a memory. I don't brag about that, but I have a brag coming about this." I tapped the photograph. "We know why she lied. She's involved. Possibly not too deep; it could be that she merely didn't want to admit she was close with him, close enough for him to tell her about the FBI. Or possibly "very" deep. 'Ever, ever shalt thou kiss.' And 'Forever wilt thou love.' But he told her he was going to marry another girl, so she shot him, probably with his own gun. The second alternative, which we prefer by far. It would be hard to nail her. She might be

Yes."
"That's just dandy. Agencies are closed today and tomorrow, so Hewitt can't start looking until Monday. I'll be at the Flamingo this evening if anything happens; for instance, if Hewitt calls to say he has decided that it's too much trouble and we have to find someone else. Tomorrow Miss Rowan is having a crowd in for Sunday lunch and dancing and I'll stay afterwards to help empty ashtrays. Any instructions for this afternoon?"
"Turn off the radio," he growled.

It bothered me for four days and four nights, from Saturday afternoon, when Wolfe said we would forget the murder, to Wednesday morning, when I did something about it on my own.
==> There were two aspects. First, if the conjecture about Sarah Dacos, or something like it, was actually a fact, I had removed evidence from the scene of a murder and was withholding it. Of course the cops had had their whack at it, they had certainly seen the photograph and had left it there, and Mrs. Althaus had given me the keys, but that was only a legal out. It was the second aspect that really bothered me. Cramer had saved our licenses for us, at least so far, and it was me, Archie Goodwin, he had invited to a conference and bought a carton of milk for and turned loose on a homicide. I have no objection to playing games with cops, sometimes you want to and sometimes you have to, but this was different. I owed Cramer something personally. <==
So it bothered me, but something else was bothering me still more, the act Wolfe was staging, the fanciest on record. Too much of it, nearly all of it, was entirely out of our control. For instance, when I called Hewitt from a booth Monday evening to ask how he had made out, and he said fine, he had got one actor at one agency and the other at another, and they would both come to his place Tuesday afternoon, and I asked if he had made sure that the one for me could drive a car and had a license, he said he had forgotten to ask, but everyone could drive a car! And that was absolutely vital and he knew it. He said he would find out right away; he had the actor's phone number. On some other details he was okay, like his phone call to our number Tuesday noon, as arranged. He told Wolfe he was extremely sorry, he apologized, but he would be able to include only twelve "Phalaenopsis Aphrodite" in the shipment instead of twenty, and no

 "Oncidium flexuosum" at all. He said he would do his best to get it off by noon Wednesday, so it should arrive by two o'clock. He handled that perfectly. He was also okay on the call he made Tuesday evening, to report on the supplies and arrangements for the dinner for the Ten for Aristology, but for him that was just routine, and anyway it was straight.
Fred Durkin and Orrie Cather were no worry because they had been left to Saul to handle, and if there was any snag he would let us know. How was up to him.
Off and on all day and evening Monday, and even some on Tuesday, Wolfe and I discussed a problem. It wasn't an argument; we just discussed it. Should I phone Wragg, the special agent in charge, arrange to meet him somewhere, tell him that Wolfe had got enough dope on the Althaus homicide to make it really tough and I wanted out, and offer to pass everything we had over to him for ten grand or twenty grand or fifty grand? The trouble was we didn't know him. It might make it next to certain that he would take the bait, but it might do just the opposite, make him smell a rat. Finally, late Tuesday morning, we crossed it off. It was too chancy, and time was too short.

Finally, late Tuesday morning, we crossed it off. It was too chancy, and time was too short.
At nine o'clock Wednesday morning, when I heard the elevator taking Wolfe up to the plant rooms, I took my second cup of breakfast coffee to the office, to sit and look at an idea that had been pecking at me off and on since Monday morning. There would be nothing for me until the truckload of orchids arrived at two o'clock; everything had been done that could be done as far as I knew, which wasn't very far. When I finished the coffee it was only nine-twenty, and Sarah Dacos probably didn't start the day at the Bruner office until nine-thirty or even ten. I went to the cabinet, unlocked the drawer where we keep assortments of keys, and made some selections. It wasn't complicated, since I knew the lock was a Bermatt. From another drawer I got a pair of rubber gloves.
At 9:35 I dialed the Bruner number, and it was answered. "Mrs. Bruner's office, good morning."
"Good morning. Miss Dacos?" "Yes."
==> "This is Archie Goodwin. I may need to see Mrs. Bruner later today, and I'm calling to ask if she'll be available." <==

She said it depended on how late, Mrs. Bruner expected to be in the office from three-thirty to five-thirty, and I said I would call again if I needed to come.
So she was at her job. I would have to take a chance on the cleaning woman. I went to the kitchen to tell Fritz I was going out to make some phone calls, to the hall for my hat and coat, and out and to Ninth Avenue for a taxi.
For the street door at 63 Arbor Street I still had the key Mrs. Althaus had given me, so I was clean until I stood at Sarah Dacos's door and got out the collection of keys. When I had knocked twice, and pushed the button twice and heard the ring, with no response, I tried a key. The fourth one did it, smooth and easy. I put the gloves on, turned the knob, opened the door, crossed the sill, and shut the door, and I had broken and entered according to the statutes of the State of New York.
The layout was the same as upstairs, but the furniture was quite different. Rugs here and there instead of carpet, smaller couch smothered with pillows, no desk or typewriter, fewer chairs, about one-fourth as many books, five little pictures on the walls which the bold lover must have considered old hat. The drapes were drawn, and I turned the lights on, put my coat and hat on the couch, and went and opened a closet door.

"Good afternoon," Wolfe said.
"Not very." Saul stretched. "I can talk?"
"Yes, with the radio."
He stretched again. "That was a ride. I hope they're alive."

==> I want to be sure," Wolfe said, "that I have their names right. Mr. Hewitt gave them to Archie on the phone." <==
"Ashley Jarvis. That's you. Dale Kirby is Archie. We'd better get them out." That was the first and only time I have ever heard men introduced while boxed.

In a moment," Wolfe said. "You have given them a full explanation?"
"Yes, sir. They are not to speak, not a word, unless you ask them to - or Archie. They don't know who has bugged the house and is watching it, or why, but they have bought Hewitt's promise that they are in no danger and won't be. He gave them five hundred dollars apiece and you are to give them another five hundred. He also gave them the statements signed by you. I think they'll do." He lowered his voice a little. "Kirby is better than Jarvis, but they'll do."
"They know they are to stay in their room and keep away from windows?"

"In that box." Saul pointed. "Our things are in it too, including guns. Of course they'll wear your hat and coat, and Archie's."
Wolfe made a face. "Very well. Fred and Orrie first."

In a moment," Wolfe said. "You have given them a full explanation?"
"Yes, sir. They are not to speak, not a word, unless you ask them to - or Archie. They don't know who has bugged the house and is watching it, or why, but they have bought Hewitt's promise that they are in no danger and won't be. He gave them five hundred dollars apiece and you are to give them another five hundred. He also gave them the statements signed by you. I think they'll do." He lowered his voice a little. "Kirby is better than Jarvis, but they'll do."
"They know they are to stay in their room and keep away from windows?"
"Yes. Except when they are - uh - rehearsing."
"They have the proper clothes for Thursday evening?"
==> "In that box." Saul pointed. "Our things are in it too, including guns. Of course they'll wear your hat and coat, and Archie's." <==
Wolfe made a face. "Very well. Fred and Orrie first."
"They're marked." He took the screwdriver from Wolfe, went to the box with a circle chalked on it, told me, "Orrie's has a triangle," and started on a screw. I found the triangle and started on it. He had Fred out before I got Orrie because one of the screws had a bad head. They too had been told not to speak unless spoken to, and from the expressions on their faces when they got upright I thought it was just as well. I raised my brows at Saul and tapped my chest, and he pointed to the box at the far end, and I went and started on it.
I realize that professional actors have had a lot of practice saying only what they are supposed to say and keeping their traps closed if that's what the script calls for, but even so I had to hand it to Ashley Jarvis and Dale Kirby. They had had a rough two hours or more - especially Jarvis, who carried fully as many pounds as Wolfe, and it wasn't quite as well distributed. We had to ease the box over on its side before he could come loose, and he stayed on the floor a good five minutes, refusing offers of help, working his arms and legs, but when he finally made it and was erect he turned to Wolfe and bowed, a damn good bow. Kirby hadn't bowed to me, but he hadn't said a word. While we waited for Jarvis to get up he stood to one side doing calisthenics, keeping time with the music on the radio.

was agreeing with Saul, they'll do. Kirby was half an inch shorter than me, but his build was just right. Jarvis was exactly Wolfe's height. His shoulders weren't quite as broad and his middle was a little farther around, but with an overcoat on he would do fine. The faces were only so-so, but it would be dark and no C-man was going to get a close-up.

==> Wolfe returned the bow with a nod, said, "Come, gentlemen," and entered the office. Instead of going to his desk, he moved a yellow chair to the center of the rug, which was thick enough to prevent noise, and went for another one. I got a couple, and Saul and Fred and Orrie each got one, and we all sat, in two circles, with Wolfe and Jarvis and Kirby on the inside. But Wolfe said, "The money, Archie," and I got up and went to the safe for it - two wads with twenty-five twenties in each which were there waiting. <==
Wolfe's eyes went from Jarvis to Kirby and back. "Lunch is ready," he said, "but first a few points. That money is yours. Archie?"
I handed it to them, a wad to each. Jarvis merely glanced at it and stuck it in his side pocket. Kirby got a wallet from his breast pocket, put the bills in nice and neat, and replaced the wallet.
"Mr. Hewitt explained," Wolfe said, "that you would each receive one thousand dollars, and now you have. But having seen you emerge from those boxes, I feel that you have already earned the thousand. Amply. Therefore, if you perform the rest of it satisfactorily, I shall feel that you have earned another thousand, and you will receive it. Friday or Saturday."
Jarvis opened his mouth, remembered just in time, and shut it. He pointed to Kirby, tapped his own chest, and looked a question.
Wolfe nodded. "Two thousand. One to each of you. A little closer, Mr. Kirby. I must keep my voice down. You gentlemen will be here twenty-eight hours. During that period there must be no single sound which, if overheard, would disclose your presence in this house. Your room is two flights up. You will use the stairs, not the elevator. If you need something there will be a man in the hall outside. If you must communicate you will whisper. There are several dozen books in your room. If none of them is to your taste you may select one from these shelves. No radio or television; the house must not be a hubbub. You will need to observe closely the posture and manner of walking of Mr. Goodwin and me, and there will be opportunities. Not our voices; that won't be necessary." He

One of them just gawked, but the one with the flash dropped it and started his hand inside his jacket. But not only did I have my gun out, Orrie was there beside me with his, and Saul's voice came from the door of the front room, "Strike one!" They turned their heads and saw two more guns.
"It looks bad," I said. "We don't even need to frisk you, you can't shoot in two

 directions at once. Mr. Wolfe!"
He was there. He must have left the kitchen when I called, "Play ball." I said, "Go around," but he had already started that way, to the right of the red leather chair, well out of their reach. At his desk he sat and eyed them - their profiles, since they were facing Orrie and me.
==> He spoke. "This is deplorable. Archie, call the police." I moved. I didn't make as wide a detour as Wolfe had, but the program would go better without a scuffle, so I circled around. Halfway to my desk I stopped and said, "Look. If you jump me when I'm dialing you won't leave here on your feet. I suppose you know the law, crashers do. You're inside. If you try getting rough they'll plug you and all they'll get from the law is thanks." <==
"Balls." It was the big handsome one with a square jaw and square shoulders. The other one was taller, but skinny, with a face that showed the bones. Handsome was giving me the stony stare. "We're not crashers, and you know it."
"Like hell I do. You crashed. You can explain it to the cops. I've warned you. Stay put. Start moving and you'll get stopped. One of them has a quick finger."
To get to the phone at my desk I had to give them my back. I did, and as I reached for the phone he snapped, "Cut the comedy, Goodwin. You know damn well what we are." He turned to Wolfe. "We're agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and you know it. We have touched nothing, and we didn't intend to. We wanted to see you. When we rang there was no answer, and the door wasn't locked, and we came in."
"You lie," Wolfe said, just stating a fact. "Five men will swear that the door was locked and you didn't ring. Four of them heard you picking it. When you are searched, by the police, your tools will be found. Federal Bureau of Investigation? Pfui. Get the police, Archie, and tell them to send men capable of handling a pair of ruffians."
Before I turned to dial I said, "Fred," and bent a finger at him, and he came. Passing them, he barely gave them elbow room. He had once had an arm twisted by a G-man, and he would have welcomed a chance to even up. With the backs of his thighs against Wolfe's desk, facing them, his gun at his hip, he looked much nastier than he actually is. He is really a nice guy, with a wife and four children. As I started dialing I would have given a hundred to one that I wouldn't

 finish, and I didn't. At the fourth whirl Handsome blurted, "Hold it, Goodwin," and I stopped my finger and turned. He was slipping his left hand inside his coat. I cradled the phone and moved beside Fred. The G-man's hand came out with his little black leather fold. "Credentials," he said, and opened it and displayed it.
That was the ticklish spot. They're supposed to show it but hang on to it. Wolfe growled, "I'll inspect it," and Handsome made a move forward, and Fred's big left hand shot out and shoved him back. I put a hand out, palm up, but said nothing. He hesitated, not long, and put it on my palm. I said, "You too," to Skinny and stretched my arm. He had his fold already out and put it on top of the other one, and I turned and handed them to Wolfe. He looked at one and then the other, opened a drawer and got his big glass, inspected them through the glass, taking his time, returned the glass to the drawer, dropped the folds in on top of it, shut the drawer, and regarded them.
"Probably forged," he said. "The police laboratory can tell."

"I'm offering a reward," I said, loud. "A framed photograph of J. Edgar Hoover to anyone who will prove that it "is" bugged and they have a tape of that to send him."
"By God," Fred said, "if only they had tried something." "I want champagne," Saul said.
"Make mine bourbon," Orrie said. "I'm hungry."
It was twenty minutes to eight. We went to the kitchen, including Wolfe, everybody talking at once. Wolfe began getting things from the refrigerator - caviar, "pate de foie gras", sturgeon, a whole smoked pheasant. Saul opened the freezer to get ice for champague. Orrie and I got bottles from the cupboard. Fred asked if he could use the phone to call his wife, and I said yes and give her my love, but Wolfe spoke.
==> "Tell her you will stay here tonight. You will all stay. In the morning Archie will take those things to the bank, and you'll go with him. They will probably do nothing, but they might try anything. Fred, tell nothing of this to your wife, or to anyone else. It isn't finished, it's only well started. If you men want something hot I can have Yorkshire Buck in twenty minutes if Archie will poach the eggs. <==
They all said no, which suited me fine. I hate to poach eggs.
An hour later we were having a pleasant evening. The three guests and I were in the front room, in a tight game of pinochle, and Wolfe was in his one and only chair in the office, reading a book. The book was "The FBI Nobody Knows". He was either gloating or doing research, I didn't know which.
At ten o'clock I had to excuse myself from the card table briefly; Wolfe had said he wanted to call Hewitt then, when the aristologists would presumably have finished their meal. I went to the office and made the call. Wolfe told Hewitt it had worked perfectly and thanked him. Hewitt said they had found the standins very entertaining; Jarvis had recited passages from Shakespeare and Kirby had mimicked President Johnson and Barry Goldwater and Alfred Lunt. Wolfe said to give them his regards, and I went back to pinochle and Wolfe to his book.
But there was another interruption a little after eleven o'clock. The phone rang, and Wolfe hates to answer it, so I went and got it at my desk.

==> "Nero Wolfe's residence, Archie Goodwin speaking." <==
"This is Richard Wragg, Goodwin." The voice was a drawl, smooth and low- pitched. "I want to speak to Wolfe."
We had known that might happen, and I had instructions.
"I'm afraid you can't, Wragg. He's engaged."
"I want to see him."
"Good idea. He thought you might. Say here, his office, at eleven in the morning?"

"Do you retract your 'by force'?"

No. I acknowledge that your retort was valid. Give me the credentials and we'll talk on even terms."
"Pfui. Are you a dunce, or do you take me for one? I have no intention of talking on even terms. You came to see me because I constrained you to, but if you came to talk nonsense you may as well leave. Shall I describe the situation as I see it?"
"Yes."
==> Wolfe turned his head. "Archie. Mrs. Bruner's letter engaging me. <==
I went to the safe and got it. As I returned Wolfe nodded at Wragg, and I handed it to him. I stood there, and when he had read it I put out a hand. He read it again, slower, and handed it over without looking up at me, and I went to my desk and put it in a drawer.
"Quite a document," he told Wolfe. "For the record, if there was any espionage of Mrs. Bruner or her family or associates, which I am not admitting, it was in connection with a security check."
Wolfe nodded. "You say that, of course. A routine lie. I am describing the situation. Your men departed last night, leaving their credentials in my possession, because they dared not call on the police to rescue them. They knew that if a citizen charged them with the crime of entering his house illegally, and pushed the charge, the sympathy of the New York police and the District Attorney would be with the citizen. You know it too. You will not take legal steps to recover the credentials, so they will not be recovered. I shall keep them. I suggest an exchange. You engage to stop all surveillance of Mrs. Bruner and her family and associates, including the tap on her telephone, and I - "
"I haven't conceded the surveillance."
"Bah. If you - No. It's simpler to rephrase it. Disregarding the past, you engage that from six o'clock today there will be by your bureau no surveillance of Mrs. Bruner or her family or associates, or her house, which includes a wiretap, and no surveillance of Mr. Goodwin or me, or my house. I engage to leave the credentials where they are, in my safe-deposit box, to take no action against your men for their invasion of my premises, and to make public no disclosure of it. That's the situation, and that's my offer."

"There certainly is." She went to the red leather chair. Saul went to a yellow one and I to mine. She asked, "What was the trap you set?"
Wolfe shook his head. "Not that. That can wait. Mr. Goodwin will give you all the details at your and his convenience. I must tell you not what has been done but what should now be done. You are my client and I must protect you from embarrassment. How discreet are you?"
She frowned. "Why do you ask that?"
"Please answer it. How discreet are you? Can you be trusted with a secret?"
"Yes."
==> His head turned. "Archie?" <==
Damn him anyway. It was all right to embarrass "me". What if I changed my mind again and decided to marry her?
"Yes," I said, "if I know where you're headed, and I think I do."
"Of course you do." To her: "I wish to save you the embarrassment of having your secretary taken from your office by the police, perhaps in your presence, to

 be questioned regarding a murder which she probably committed."

I walked home. It was a little after half past five, dark, when I mounted the stoop and let myself in. I went to the kitchen, got a glass of milk, and asked Fritz, "Has he told you that we're off the hook?"
"No." He was inspecting carrots.
"Well, we are. Say anything you want to on the phone. Resume with your girl friends. If a stranger speaks to you, do as you please. Do you want some good advice?"
"Yes."
"Hit him for a raise. I am. By the way, I haven't asked you about the dinner last night. Did you feed them good?"
==> He leveled his eyes at me. "Archie, that is never to be mentioned. That terrible day. "Epouvantable." My mind was here with you. I don't know what I did, I don't know what was served. I will forget it if possible." <==
"Hewitt said on the phone that they stood and applauded you."
"But certainly. They were polite. I "know" I put no truffles in the "Perigourdine"."
"Good God. I'm glad I wasn't there. Okay, we'll forget it. May I have a carrot? It's wonderful with milk."
He said certainly, and I helped myself.
I was at my desk, making out checks to pay bills, when Wolfe came down from the plant rooms. Though he hadn't said so I knew he was as much on edge as I

"No doubt. Will Mr. Wragg be at his office?" "He could be."
"Get him."
I turned and got the phone, but as I started to dial the doorbell rang. I cradled it and went to the hall for a look, turned, and said, "You can ask him for the receipt."
He took a breath. "Is he alone?"
I told him yes and went to the front and opened the door. Cramer didn't have a carton of milk for me. He had nothing at all for me, not even a nod. When I had his coat he made for the office, and when I got there he was planted in the red leather chair and talking. I got the end of it: "...and I might have known better. God knows I "should" know better." He switched to me as I sat. "Where did you get that gun and when did you put it there?"
==> "Confound it," Wolfe growled, "you shouldn't have come. You should have waited until you had arranged your mind. Archie, get Mr. Wragg." <==
When Cramer is boiling it isn't easy to stop the steam, but that did, the name Wragg. I didn't see him clamp his jaw and glare at Wolfe, I only knew he did, because my back was turned as I dialed LE5-7700. I was supposing it would take patience and staying power to get through to the top, but not at all. Apparently word had been passed down that a call from Nero Wolfe had priority, which was a good sign. In no time the smooth low-pitched drawl was in my ear, and in Wolfe's too, for he had picked up his phone. I stayed on.

"Wolfe?"
"Yes. Mr. Wragg?" "Yes."
"I'm ready for that bullet. Now. As we agreed. Bring the bullet, and I surrender the credentials if you are not satisfied within a month. I think it will be sooner, much sooner.

But by the time I had reached the door I had changed my mind. Not because of him. He looked perfectly normal - big and burly, round red face with bushy gray eyebrows, broad heavy shoulders straining the sleeve seams of his coat. It was the carton. It was a used one, the right size, the cord around it was the kind McLeod used, and the NERO WOLFE on it in blue crayon was McLeod’s style of printing. Having switched the stoop light on, I could observe those details as I approached, so I swung the door open and asked politely, "Where did you get the corn?"
I suppose I should explain a little. Usually Wolfe comes closest to being human after dinner, when we leave the dining room to cross the hall to the office, and he gets his bulk deposited in his favorite chair behind his desk, and Fritz brings coffee; and either Wolfe opens his current book or, if I have no date and am staying in, he starts a conversation. The topic may be anything from women’s shoes to the importance of the new moon in Babylonian astrology. But that evening he had taken his cup and crossed to the big globe over by the bookshelves and stood twirling the globe, scowling at it, probably picking a place he would rather be.
For the corn hadn’t come. By an arrangement with a farmer named Duncan McLeod up in Putman County, every Tuesday from July 20 to October 5, sixteen ears of just-picked corn were delivered. They were roasted in the husk, and we did our own shucking as we ate - four ears for me, eight for Wolfe, and four in the kitchen for Fritz. The corn had to arrive no earlier than five-thirty and no later than six-thirty. That day it hadn’t arrived at all, and Fritz had had to do some stuffed eggplant, so Wolfe was standing scowling at the globe when the doorbell rang.


==> And now here was Inspector Cramer with the carton. Could it possibly be it? It was. Handing me his hat to put on the shelf, he tramped down the hall to the office, and when I entered he had put the carton on Wolfe’s desk and had his knife out to cut the cord, and Wolfe, cup in hand, was crossing to him. Cramer opened the flaps, took out an ear of corn, held it up, and said, "If you were going to have this for dinner, I guess it’s too late." <==
Wolfe moved to his elbow, turned the flap to see the inscription, his name, grunted, circled around the desk to his chair, and sat. "You have your effect," he said. "I am impressed. Where did you get it?"
"If you don’t know, maybe Goodwin does." Cramer shot a glance at me, went to the red leather chair facing the end of Wolfe’s desk, and sat. "I’ve got some questions for you and for him, but of course you want grounds. You would. At a quarter past five, four hours ago, the dead body of a man was found in the alley back of Rusterman’s restaurant. He had been hit in the back of the head with a piece of iron pipe which was there on the ground by the body. The station wagon he had come in was alongside the receiving platform of the restaurant, and in the station wagon were nine cartons containing ears of corn." Cramer pointed. "That’s one of them, your name on it. You get one like it every Tuesday. Right?"
Wolfe nodded. "I do. In season. Has the body been identified?"
"Yes. Driver’s license and other items in his pockets, including cash, eighty- some dollars. Kenneth Faber, twenty-eight years old. Also men at the restaurant identified him. He had been delivering the corn there the past five weeks, and then he had been coming on here with yours. Right?"
"I don’t know."

 and now he was shucking it. From where I sat, at my desk, the rows of kernels looked too big, too yellow, and too crowded. Wolfe frowned at it, muttered, "I thought so," put it down, stood up, reached for the carton, said, "You will help, Archie," took an ear, and started shucking it. As I got up Cramer said something but was ignored.
When we finished we had three piles, as assorted by Wolfe. Two ears were too young, six were too old, and eight were just right. He returned to his chair, looked at Cramer, and declared, "This is preposterous."
"So you’re stalling," Cramer growled. "No. Shall I expound it?"
"Yeah. Go ahead."

"No. Millions of American women, and some men, commit that outrage every summer day. They are turning a superb treat into mere provender. Shucked and boiled in water, sweet corn is edible and nutritious; roasted in the husk in the hottest possible oven for forty minutes, shucked at the table, and buttered and salted, nothing else, it is ambrosia. No chef’s ingenuity and imagination have ever created a finer dish. American women should themselves be boiled in water. Ideally the corn - "
"How much longer are you going to stall?"


"I’m not stalling. Ideally the corn should go straight from the stalk to the oven, but of course that’s impractical for city dwellers. If it’s picked at the right stage of development it is still a treat for the palate after twenty-four hours, or even forty-eight; I have tried it. But look at this." Wolfe pointed to the assorted piles. "This is preposterous. Mr. McLeod knows better. The first year I had him send two dozen ears, and I returned those that were not acceptable. He knows what I require, and he knows how to choose it without opening the husk. He is supposed to be equally meticulous with the supply for the restaurant, but I doubt if he is; they take fifteen to twenty dozen. Are they serving what they got today?"
==> "Yes. They’ve admitted that they took it from the station wagon even before they reported the body." Cramer’s chin was down, and his eyes were narrowed under the eyebrow hedge. "You’re the boss at that restaurant." <==
Wolfe shook his head. "Not the boss. My trusteeship, under the will of my friend Marko Vukcic when he died, will end next year. You know the arrangement; you investigated the murder; you may remember that I brought the murderer back from Yugoslavia."
"Yeah. Maybe I never thanked you." Cramer’s eyes came to me. "You go there fairly often - not to Yugoslavia, to Rusterman’s. How often?"
I raised one brow. That annoys him because he can’t do it. "Oh, once a week, sometimes twice. I have privileges, and it’s the best restaurant in New York."
"Sure. Were you there today?"
"No."

How well do you know him?"
"Not well at all. I call him Carl, but you know how that is. We have been fellow weekend guests at Miss Rowan’s place in the country a couple of times. I have seen him only when I have been with Miss Rowan."
"Do you know why his name would be in Faber’s notebook with a checkmark?" "I don’t know and I couldn’t guess."
"Do you want me to connect Susan McLeod before I ask you about her?"
==> I had supposed that would be coming as soon as I heard the name Carl Heydt, since the cops had had the notebook for four hours and had certainly lost no time making contacts. Saving me for the last, and Cramer himself coming, was of course a compliment, but more for Wolfe than for me. <==
"No, thanks," I told him. "I’ll do the connecting. The first time Kenneth Faber came with the corn, six weeks ago today, the first time I ever saw him, he told me Sue McLeod had got her father to give him a job on the farm. He was very chatty. He said he was a freelance cartoonist, and the cartoon business was in a slump, and he wanted some sun and air and his muscles needed exercise, and Sue often spent weekends at the farm and that would be nice. You can’t beat that for a connection. Go ahead and ask me about Susan McLeod."
Cramer was eying me. "You’re never slow, are you, Goodwin?"
I gave him a grin. "Slow as cold honey. But I try hard to keep up." "Don’t overdo. How long have you been intimate with her?" "Well. There are several definitions for ‘intimate.’ Which one?" "You know damn well which one."
My shoulders went up. "If you won’t say, I’ll have to guess." The shoulders went down. "If you mean the very worst, or the very best, depending on how you look at it, nothing doing. I have known her three years, having met her when she brought the corn one day. Have you seen her?"
"Yes."

"Then I give her a mark. You were at her about a murder, and she didn’t want to drag in Miss Rowan. One day, the second summer she was bringing the corn, two years ago, she said she wanted a job in New York and asked if I could get her one. I doubted if she could hold a job any friend of mine might have open or might make room for, so I consulted Miss Rowan, and she took it on. She got two girls she knew to share their apartment with Sue - it’s only five blocks from here, not six - she paid for a course at the Midtown Studio - Sue has paid her back - and she got Carl Heydt to give Sue a tryout at modeling. I understand that Sue is now one of the ten most popular models in New York and her price is a hundred dollars an hour, but that’s hearsay. I haven’t seen her on a magazine cover. I didn’t get her a job or a place to live. I know Miss Rowan better than Sue does; she won’t mind my dragging her in. Anything else?"
"Plenty. When and how did you find out that Kenneth Faber had shoved you out and taken Sue over?"


"Nuts." I turned to Wolfe. "Your Honor, I object to the question on the ground that it is insulting, impertinent, and disgusticulous. It assumes not only that I am shovable but also that I can be shoved out of a place I have never been."
==> "Objection sustained." A corner of Wolfe’s mouth was up a little. "You will rephrase the question, Mr. Cramer." <==
"The hell I will." Cramer’s eyes kept at me. "You might as well open up, Goodwin. We have a signed statement from her. What passed between you and Faber when he was here a week ago today?"
"The corn. It passed from him to me."
"So you’re a clown. I already know that. A real wit. What else?"
"Well, let’s see." I screwed my lips, concentrating. "The bell rang and I went and opened the door and said, quote, ‘Greetings. How’s things on the farm?’ As he handed me the carton he said, ‘Lousy, thank you, hot as hell and I’ve got blisters.’ As I took it I said, ‘What’s a few blisters if you’re the backbone of the country?’ He said, ‘Go soak your head,’ and went, and I shut the door and took the carton to the kitchen."
"That’s it?" "That’s it."

"The minute’s up. Come on."
I stayed put. "No. I now have a right to be sore, so I am. You’ll have to make it good."

You think I won’t?" At least I had him glaring. "You’re under arrest as a material witness. Move!"
I took my time getting up. "You have no warrant, but I don’t want to be fussy." I turned to Wolfe. "If you want me around tomorrow, you might give Parker a ring."
==> "I shall." He swiveled. "Mr. Cramer. Knowing your considerable talents as I do, I am sometimes dumfounded by your fatuity. You were so bent on baiting Mr. Goodwin that you completely ignored the point I was at pains to make." He pointed at the piles on his desk. "Who picked that corn? Pfui!" <==

AT TWENTY MINUTES PAST ELEVEN Wednesday morning, standing at the curb on Leonard Street with Nathaniel Parker, I said, "Of course in a way it’s a compliment. Last time the bail was a measly five hundred. Now twenty grand. That’s progress."
Parker nodded. "That’s one way of looking at it. He argued for fifty thousand, but I got it down to twenty. You know what that means. They actually - Here’s one."
A taxi headed in to us and stopped. When we were in and I had told the driver Eighth Avenue and 35th Street, and we were rolling, Parker resumed, leaning to me and keeping his voice down. The legal mind. Hackies are even better listeners than they are talkers, and that one could be a spy sicked on us by the district attorney. "They actually," he said, "think you may have killed that man. This is serious, Archie. I told the judge that bail in the amount that was asked would be justified only if they had enough evidence to charge you with murder, in which case you wouldn’t be bailable, and he agreed. As your counsel, I must advise you to be prepared for such a charge at any moment. I didn’t like Mandel’s attitude. By the way, Wolfe told me to send my bill to you, not him. He said this is your affair and he isn’t concerned. I’ll make it moderate."

I told the judge that bail in the amount that was asked would be justified only if they had enough evidence to charge you with murder, in which case you wouldn’t be bailable, and he agreed. As your counsel, I must advise you to be prepared for such a charge at any moment. I didn’t like Mandel’s attitude. By the way, Wolfe told me to send my bill to you, not him. He said this is your affair and he isn’t concerned. I’ll make it moderate."
==> I thanked him. I already knew that Assistant District Attorney Mandel, and maybe Cramer too, regarded me as a real candidate for the big one. Cramer had taken me to his place, Homicide South, and after spending half an hour on me <==

 had turned me over to Lieutenant Rowcliff and gone home. Rowcliff had stood me for nearly an hour - I had him stuttering in fourteen minutes, not a record - and had then sent me under convoy to the DA’s office, where Mandel had taken me on, obviously expecting to make a night of it.
Which he did, with the help of a pair of dicks from the DA’s Homicide Bureau. He had of course been phoned to by both Cramer and Rowcliff, and it was evident from the start that he didn’t merely think I was holding out on details that might be useful, to prevent either bother for myself or trouble for someone else; he had me tagged as a real prospect. Naturally I wanted to know why, so I played along. I hadn’t with Cramer because he had got me sore in front of Wolfe, and I hadn’t with Rowcliff because playing along is impossible with a double-breasted baboon, but with Mandel I could. Of course he was asking the questions, him and the dicks, but the trick is to answer them in such a way that the next question, or maybe one later on, tells you something you want to know, or at least gives you a hint. That takes practice, but I had had plenty, and it makes it simpler when one guy pecks away at you for an hour or so and then backs off, and another guy starts in and goes all over it again.
For instance, the scene of the crime - the alley and receiving platform at the rear of Rusterman’s. Since Wolfe was the trustee, there was nothing about that restaurant I wasn’t familiar with. From the side street it was only about fifteen yards along the narrow alley to the platform, and the alley ended a few feet farther on at the wall of another building. A car or small truck entering to deliver something had to back out. Knowing, as I had, that Kenneth Faber would come with the corn sometime after five o’clock, I could have walked in and hid under the platform behind a concrete post, with the weapon in my hand, and, when Faber drove in, got out, and came around to open the tailgate, he would never know what hit him. If I could have done that, who couldn’t? I would have had to know one other thing, that I couldn’t be seen from the windows of the restaurant kitchen because the glass had been painted on the inside so boys and girls couldn’t climb onto the platform to watch Leo boning a duck or Felix stirring goose blood into a Sauce Rouennaise.
In helping them get it on the record that I knew all that, I learned only that they had found no one who had seen the murderer in the alley or entering or leaving it, that Faber had probably been dead five to ten minutes when someone came from the kitchen to the platform and found the body, and that the weapon was a piece of two-inch galvanized iron pipe sixteen and five-eighths inches long,

Parker nodded. "That’s one way of looking at it. He argued for fifty thousand, but I got it down to twenty. You know what that means. They actually - Here’s one."
A taxi headed in to us and stopped. When we were in and I had told the driver Eighth Avenue and 35th Street, and we were rolling, Parker resumed, leaning to me and keeping his voice down. The legal mind. Hackies are even better listeners than they are talkers, and that one could be a spy sicked on us by the district attorney. "They actually," he said, "think you may have killed that man. This is serious, Archie.

 threaded male at one end and female at the other, old and battered. Easy to hide under a coat. Where it came from might be discovered by one man in ten hours, or by a thousand men in ten years.
Getting those details was nothing, since they would be in the morning papers, but regarding their slant on me I got some hints that the papers wouldn’t have. Hints were the best I could get, no facts to check, so I’ll just report how it looked when Parker came to spring me in the morning. They hadn’t let me see Sue’s statement, but it must have been something in it, or something she had said, or something someone else, maybe Carl Heydt or Peter Jay or Max Maslow, had said, either to her or to the cops. Or possibly something Duncan McLeod, Sue’s father, had said. That didn’t seem likely, but I included him because I saw him. When Parker and I entered the anteroom on our way out he was there on a chair in the row against the wall, dressed for town, with a necktie, his square deep- tanned face shiny with sweat. I crossed over and told him good morning, and he said it wasn’t, it was a bad morning, a day lost and no one to leave to see to things. It was no place for a talk, with people there on the chairs, but I might at least have asked him who had picked the corn if someone hadn’t come to take him inside.

"How long has she been here?" "Half an hour."
"Excuse my manners. I’ve had a night." I headed for the end of the hall, the swinging door to the kitchen, pushed it open, and entered. Wolfe was at the center table with a glass of beer in his hand. He grunted. "So. Have you slept?"
"No."
"Have you eaten?"
I got a glass from the cupboard, went to the refrigerator and got milk, filled the glass, and took a sip. "If you could see the bacon and eggs they had brought in for me and I paid two bucks for, let alone taste it, you’d never be the same. You’d be so afraid you might be hauled in as a material witness you’d lose your nerve. They think maybe I killed Faber. For your information, I didn’t." I sipped milk. "This will hold me till lunch. I understand I have a caller. As you told Parker, this is my affair and you are not concerned. May I take her to the front room? I’m not intimate enough with her to take her up to my room." I sipped milk.
==> "Confound it," he growled. "How much of what you told Mr. Cramer was flummery?" <==
"None. All straight. But he’s on me and so is the DA, and I’ve got to find out why." I sipped milk.

He was eying me. "You will see Miss McLeod in the office." "The front room will do. It may be an hour. Two hours." "You may need the telephone. The office."
If I had been myself I would have given that offer a little attention, but I was somewhat pooped. So I went, taking my half a glass of milk. The door to the office was closed and, entering, I closed it again. She wasn’t in the red leather chair. Since she was there for me, not for Wolfe, Fritz had moved up one of the yellow chairs for her, but hearing the door open and seeing me she had sprung up, and by the time I had shut the door and turned she was to me, gripping my arms, her head tilted back to get my eyes. If it hadn’t been for the milk I would have used my arms for one of their basic functions, since that’s a sensible way to start a good frank talk with a girl. That being impractical, I tilted my head forward and kissed her. Not just a peck. She not only took it, she helped, and her grip on my arms tightened, and I had to keep the glass plumb by feel since I couldn’t see it. It wouldn’t have been polite for me to quit, so I left it to her.
She let go, backed up a step, and said, "You haven’t shaved."

"Again. Did you kill him?" "No, Archie!"
I turned and went back to my chair. She came a step forward, backed up, and sat. "That’s my private lie detector," I told her. "Not patented. Either I wriggle off by selling them on you, and it would take some wriggling, which is not my style, or I do a job that is my style - I hope. As you know, I work for Nero Wolfe. First I see him and tell him I’m taking a leave of absence - I hope a short one. Then you and I go some place where we’re sure we won’t be interrupted, and you tell me things, a lot of things, and no fudging. Where I go from there depends on what you tell me. I’ll tell you one thing now, if you - "
The door opened and Wolfe was there. He crossed to the corner of his desk,

 faced her, and spoke. "I’m Nero Wolfe. Will you please move to this chair?" He indicated the red leather chair by a nod, circled around his desk, and sat. He looked at me. "A job that is your style?"
==> Well. As I remarked when he insisted that I see her in the office, if I hadn’t been pooped I would have given that offer a little attention. If I had been myself I would have known, or at least suspected, what he intended. I suppose he and I came as close to trusting each other as any two men can, on matters of joint concern, but as he had told Parker, this was my affair, and I was discussing it with someone in his office, keeping him away from his favorite chair, and I had just told him that nothing of what I had told Cramer was flummery. So he had gone to the hole in the alcove. <==
I looked back at him. "I said I hope. What if I heard the panel open and steered clear?"
"Pfui. Clear of what?"
"Okay. Your trick. But I think she has a right to know."
"I agree." Sue had moved to the red leather chair, and he swiveled. "Miss McLeod. I eavesdropped, without Mr. Goodwin’s knowledge. I heard all that was said, and I saw. Do you wish to complain?"
She had fingered her hair back, but it was still a sight. "Why?" she asked.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 241    window = 236 246

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 73477    window = 73472 73482


She was frowning. "But you can’t... you said identify him. How can you?" "I don’t know. Perhaps I can’t, but I must try. Nine o’clock?"
She didn’t want to, even after the concessions he had made, but she had to admit that we had to get some kind of information from somebody, and who else was there to start with? So she finally agreed, definitely, and Wolfe leaned back with his eyes shut and his lips tight, and Fritz came to announce lunch. Sue got up to go, and when I returned after seeing her to the door and out, Wolfe had crossed to the dining room and was at the table. Instead of joining him, I stood and said, "Ordinarily I would think I was well worth it, but right now I’m no bargain at any price. Have we a program for the afternoon?"

No. Except to telephone Mr. McLeod."
"I saw him at the DA’s office. Then I’m going up and rinse off before I eat. I think I smell. Tell Fritz to save me a bite in the kitchen."
==> I went to the hall and mounted the two flights to my room. During the forty minutes it took to do the job I kept telling my brain to lay off until it caught up, but it wouldn’t. It insisted on trying to analyze the situation, with the emphasis on Sue McLeod. If I had her figured wrong, if she was it, it would almost certainly be a waste of time to try to get anything from three guys who were absolutely hooked, and if there was no program for the afternoon I had damn well better think one up. If it would be a calamity for Wolfe to lose me for good, what would it be for me? By the time I stepped into the shower the brain had it doped that the main point was the piece of pipe. She had not gone into that alley toting that pipe; that was out. But I hadn’t got that point settled conclusively by Cramer or Mandel, and I hadn’t seen a morning paper. I would consult the Times when I went downstairs. But the brain wanted to know now, and when I left the shower I dried in a hurry, went to the phone on the bedtable, dialed the Gazette, got Lon Cohen, and asked him. Of course he knew I had spent the night downtown and he wanted a page or two of facts, but I told him I was naked and would catch cold, and how final was it that whoever had conked Faber had brought the pipe with him? Sewed up, Lon said. Positively. The pipe was at the laboratory, revealing - maybe - its past to the scientists, and three or four dicks with color photos of it were trying to pick up its trail. I thanked him and promised him something for a headline if and when. So that was settled. As I went to a drawer for clean shorts the brain started in on Carl Heydt, but it had darned little to work on, and by the time I tied my tie it was buzzing around trying to find a place to land. <==
Downstairs, Wolfe was still in the dining room, but I went on by to the kitchen, got at my breakfast table with the Times, and was served by Fritz with what do you think? Corn fritters. There had been eight perfectly good ears, and Fritz hates to throw good food away. With bacon and homemade blackberry jam they were ambrosia, and in the Times report on the Faber murder Wolfe’s name was mentioned twice and mine four times, so it was a fine meal. I had finished the eighth fritter and was deciding whether to take on another one and a third cup of coffee when the doorbell rang, and I got up and went to the hall for a look. Wolfe was back in the office, and I stuck my head in and said, "McLeod."

He let out a growl. True, he had told Sue he must see her father and was even going to phone to ask him to come in from the country, but he always resents an unexpected visitor, no matter who. Ignoring the growl, I went to the front and opened the door, and when McLeod said he wanted to see Mr. Wolfe, with his burr on the r, I invited him in, took his Sunday hat, a dark gray antique fedora in good condition, put it on the shelf, and took him to the office. Wolfe, who is no hand-shaker, told him good afternoon and motioned to the red leather chair.
McLeod stood. "No need to sit," he said. "I’ve been told about the corn and I came to apologize. I’m to blame, and I’d like to explain how it happened. I didn’t pick it; that young man did. Kenneth Faber."
Wolfe grunted. "Wasn’t that heedless? I telephoned the restaurant this morning and was told that theirs was as bad as mine. You know what we require."

 you bring Miss Pinelli to my room at five minutes to nine in the morning?"
"No. She doesn’t get to her office until nine-thirty."
"Then bring her to the plant rooms at nine-forty with the affidavit." He looked at the wall clock. "You can type it in the morning. You’ve had no sleep for forty hours. Go to bed."
That was quite a compliment, and I was appreciating it as I mounted the stairs to my room. Except for a real emergency he will permit no interruptions from nine to eleven in the morning, when he is in the plant rooms, but he wasn’t going to wait until he came down to the office to get the affidavit notarized. As I got into bed and turned the light off I was considering whether to ask for a raise now or wait till the end of the year, but before I made up my mind I didn’t have a mind. It was gone.
I never did actually make up my mind about passing the buck to Sue. I was still on the fence after breakfast Thursday morning, when I dialed the number of Lila Pinelli, who adds maybe two bucks a week to the take of her secretarial service in a building on Eighth Avenue by doubling as a notary public. Doing the affidavits didn’t commit me to anything; the question was, what then? So I asked her to come, and she came, and I took her up to the plant rooms. She was in a hurry to get back, but she had never seen the orchids, and no one alive could just breeze on by those benches, with everything from the neat little Oncidiums to the big show-offs like the Laeliocattleyas. So it was after ten o’clock when we came back down and I paid her and let her out, and I went to the office and put the document in the safe.
==> As I say, I never did actually make up my mind; it just happened. At ten minutes past eleven Wolfe, having come down at eleven as usual, was at his desk looking over the morning crop of mail, and I was at mine sorting the germination slips he had brought, when the doorbell rang. I stepped to the hall for a look, turned, and said, "Cramer. I’ll go hide in the cellar." <==
"Confound it," he growled. "I wanted - Very well." "There’s no law about answering doorbells."
"No. We’ll see."

I went to the front, opened up, said good morning, and gave him room. He crossed the sill, took a folded paper from a pocket, and handed it to me. I unfolded it, and a glance was enough, but I read it through. "At least my name’s spelled right," I said. I extended my hands, the wrists together. "Okay, do it right. You never know."
"You’d clown in the chair," he said. "I want to see Wolfe." He marched down the hall and into the office. Very careless. I could have scooted on out and away, and for half a second I considered it, but I wouldn’t have been there to see the look on his face when he found I was gone. When I entered the office he was lowering his fanny onto the red leather chair and putting his hat on the stand beside it. Also he was speaking. "I have just handed Goodwin a warrant for his arrest," he was saying, "and this time he’d stay."

"I have just handed Goodwin a warrant for his arrest," he was saying, "and this time he’d stay."
I stood. "It’s an honor," I said. "Anyone can be banged by a bull or a dick. It takes me to be pinched by an inspector, and twice in one week."
His eyes stayed at Wolfe. "I came myself," he said, "because I want to tell you how it stands. A police officer with a warrant to serve is not only allowed to use his discretion, he’s supposed to. I know damn well what Goodwin will do, he’ll clam up, and a crowbar wouldn’t pry him open. Give me that warrant, Goodwin."
"It’s mine. You’ve served it."
"I have not. I just showed it to you." He stretched an arm and took it. "When I was here Tuesday night," he told Wolfe, "you were dumfounded by my fatuity. So you said in your fancy way. All you cared about was who picked that corn. I came myself to see how you feel now. Goodwin will talk if you tell him to. Do you want me to wait in the front room while you discuss it? Not all day, say ten minutes. I’m giving you a - "
==> He stopped to glare. Wolfe had pushed his chair back and was rising, and of course Cramer thought he was walking out. It wouldn’t have been the first time. But Wolfe headed for the safe, not the hall. As he turned the handle and pulled the door open, there I was. If he had told me to bring it instead of going for it himself, I could have stalled while I made up my mind, even with Cramer there, but as I have said twice before I never did actually make up my mind. I merely went to my desk and sat. I owed Sue McLeod nothing. If either she or I was going to be cooped, there were two good reasons why it should be her: she had <==

 made the soup herself, and I wouldn’t be much help in the joint affair if I was salted down. So I sat, and Wolfe got it from the safe, went and handed it to Cramer, and spoke. "I suggest that you look at the affidavits first. The last two sheets."
Over the years I have made a large assortment of cracks about Inspector Cramer, but I admit he has his points. Having inspected the affidavits, he went through the twelve pages fast, and then he went back and started over and took his time. Altogether, more than half an hour; and not once did he ask a question or even look up. And when he finished, even then no questions. Lieutenant Rowcliff or Sergeant Purley Stebbins would have kept at us for an hour. Cramer merely gave each of us a five-second straight hard look, folded the document and put it in his inside breast pocket, rose and came to my desk, picked up the phone, and dialed. In a moment he spoke.
"Donovan? Inspector Cramer. Give me Sergeant Stebbins." In another moment: "Purley? Get Susan McLeod. Don’t call her, get her. Go yourself. I’ll be there in ten minutes and I want her there fast. Take a man along. If she balks, wrap her up and carry her."
He cradled the phone, went to the stand and got his hat, and marched out.

OF ALL THE THOUSAND or more times I have felt like putting vinegar in Wolfe’s beer, I believe the closest I ever came to doing it was that Thursday evening when the doorbell rang at a quarter past nine, and after a look at the front I told him that Carl Heydt, Max Maslow, and Peter Jay were on the stoop, and he said they were not to be admitted.

In the nine and a half hours that had passed since Cramer had used my phone to call Purley Stebbins I had let it lie. I couldn’t expect Wolfe to start any fur flying until there was a reaction, or there wasn’t, say by tomorrow noon, to what had happened to Sue. However, I had made a move on my own. When Wolfe had left the office at four o’clock to go up to the plant rooms, I had told him I would be out on an errand for an hour or so, and I had taken a walk, to Rusterman’s, thinking I might pick up some little hint.

"I have not. I just showed it to you." He stretched an arm and took it. "When I was here Tuesday night," he told Wolfe, "you were dumfounded by my fatuity. So you said in your fancy way. All you cared about was who picked that corn. I came myself to see how you feel now. Goodwin will talk if you tell him to. Do you want me to wait in the front room while you discuss it? Not all day, say ten minutes. I’m giving you a - "
He stopped to glare. Wolfe had pushed his chair back and was rising, and of course Cramer thought he was walking out. It wouldn’t have been the first time. But Wolfe headed for the safe, not the hall. As he turned the handle and pulled the door open, there I was. If he had told me to bring it instead of going for it himself, I could have stalled while I made up my mind, even with Cramer there, but as I have said twice before I never did actually make up my mind. I merely went to my desk and sat. I owed Sue McLeod nothing. If either she or I was going to be cooped, there were two good reasons why it should be her: she had

 made the soup herself, and I wouldn’t be much help in the joint affair if I was salted down. So I sat, and Wolfe got it from the safe, went and handed it to Cramer, and spoke. "I suggest that you look at the affidavits first. The last two sheets."
Over the years I have made a large assortment of cracks about Inspector Cramer, but I admit he has his points. Having inspected the affidavits, he went through the twelve pages fast, and then he went back and started over and took his time. Altogether, more than half an hour; and not once did he ask a question or even look up. And when he finished, even then no questions. Lieutenant Rowcliff or Sergeant Purley Stebbins would have kept at us for an hour. Cramer merely gave each of us a five-second straight hard look, folded the document and put it in his inside breast pocket, rose and came to my desk, picked up the phone, and dialed. In a moment he spoke.
==> "Donovan? Inspector Cramer. Give me Sergeant Stebbins." In another moment: "Purley? Get Susan McLeod. Don’t call her, get her. Go yourself. I’ll be there in ten minutes and I want her there fast. Take a man along. If she balks, wrap her up and carry her." <==
He cradled the phone, went to the stand and got his hat, and marched out.

OF ALL THE THOUSAND or more times I have felt like putting vinegar in Wolfe’s beer, I believe the closest I ever came to doing it was that Thursday evening when the doorbell rang at a quarter past nine, and after a look at the front I told him that Carl Heydt, Max Maslow, and Peter Jay were on the stoop, and he said they were not to be admitted.

I didn’t. First I went out back for a look at the platform and the alley, which might seem screwy, since two days and nights had passed and the city scientists

 had combed it, but you never know. I once got an idea just running my eye around a hotel room where a woman had spent a night six months earlier. But I got nothing from the platform or alley except a scraped ear from squeezing under the platform and out again, and after talking with Felix and Joe and some of the kitchen staff I crossed it off. No one had seen or heard anyone or anything until Zoltan had stepped out for a cigarette (no smoking is allowed in the kitchen) and had seen the station wagon and the body on the ground.
I would have let it ride that evening, no needling until tomorrow noon. When Lily Rowan phoned around seven o’clock and said Sue had phoned her from the DA’s office that she was under arrest and had to have a lawyer and would Lily send her one, and Lily wanted me to come and tell her what was what, I would have gone if I hadn’t wanted to be on hand if there was a development. But when the development came Wolfe told me not to let it in.
I straight-eyed him. "You said you’d be concerned."

May I have your name, sir?"
"My name’s Palmer. Delbert Palmer. Why?"
"I like to know the names of men who render me a service. Did you pick the corn?"
"Hell, no. McLeod picked it." "Did you pack it in the carton?"
"No, he did. Look here, I know you’re a detective. You just ask questions from habit, huh?"
==> "No, Mr. Palmer. I merely want to be sure about the corn. I’m obliged to you. Good day, sir." He bent over to slip his fingers under the cord, lifted the carton, and headed for the office. Palmer told me distinctly, "It takes all kinds," turned, and started down the steps, and I shut the door. In the office, Wolfe was standing eying the carton, which he had put on the seat of the red leather chair. As I crossed over he said without looking up, "Get Mr. Cramer." <==
It’s nice to have a man around who obeys orders no matter how batty they are and saves the questions for later. That time the questions got answered before they were asked. I went to my desk, dialed Homicide South, and got Cramer, and Wolfe, who had gone to his chair, took his phone.
"Mr. Cramer? I must ask a favor. I have here in my office a carton which has just been delivered to me. It is supposed to contain corn, and perhaps it does, but it is conceivable that it contains dynamite and a contraption that will detonate it when the cord is cut and the flaps raised. My suspicion may be groundless, but I have it. I know this is not your department, but you will know how to proceed. Will you please notify the proper person without delay? ... That can wait until we know what’s in the carton... Certainly. Even if it contains only corn I’ll give you all relevant information... No, there is no ticking sound. If it does contain explosives there is almost certainly no danger until the carton is opened... Yes, I’ll make sure."
He hung up, swiveled, and glared at the carton. "Confound it," he growled, "again. We’ll get some somewhere before the season ends."

THE FIRST CITY EMPLOYEE to arrive, four or five minutes after Wolfe hung up, was one in uniform. Wolfe was telling me what Saul’s errand had been when the doorbell rang, and since I resented the interruption I trotted to the front, opened the door, saw a prowl car at the curb, and demanded rudely, "Well?"

"Where’s that carton?" he demanded back.
"Where it will stay until someone comes who knows something." I was shutting the door but his foot was there.
"You’re Archie Goodwin," he said. "I know about you. I’m coming in. Did you yell for help or didn’t you?"
He had a point. An officer of the law doesn’t have to bring a search warrant to enter a house whose owner has asked the police to come and get a carton of maybe dynamite. I gave him room to enter, shut the door, took him to the office, pointed to the carton, and said, "If you touch it and it goes off we can sue you for damages."
"You couldn’t pay me to touch it," he said. "I’m here to see that nobody does." He glanced around, went over by the big globe, and stood, a good fifteen feet away from the carton. With him there, the rest of the explanation of Saul’s errand had to wait, but I had something to look at to pass the time - a carbon copy, one sheet, which Wolfe had taken from his desk drawer and handed me, of something Saul had typed on my machine during my absence Thursday evening.
==> The second city employee to arrive, at ten minutes to six, was Inspector Cramer. When the bell rang and I went to let him in the look on his face was one I had seen before. He knew Wolfe had something fancy by the tail, and he would have given a month’s pay before taxes to know what. He tramped to the office, saw the carton, turned to the cop, got a salute but didn’t acknowledge it, and said, "You can go, Schwab." <==
"Yes, sir. Stay out front?" "No. You won’t be needed."
Fully as rude as I had been, but he was a superior officer. Schwab saluted again and went. Cramer looked at the red leather chair. He always sat there, but the

 carton was on it. I moved up one of the yellow ones, and he sat, took his hat off and dropped it on the floor, and asked Wolfe, "What is this, a gag?"
Wolfe shook his head. "It may be a bugaboo, but I’m not crying wolf. I can tell you nothing until we know what’s in the carton."

"The hell you can’t. When did it come?" "One minute before I telephoned you." "Who brought it?"
"A stranger. A man I had never seen before." "Why do you think it’s dynamite?"

==> I missed the rest because the doorbell rang and I went. It was the bomb squad, two of them. They were in uniform, but one look and you knew they weren’t flatties - if nothing else, their eyes. When I opened the door I saw another one down on the sidewalk, and their special bus, with its made-to-order enclosed body, was double-parked in front. I asked, "Bomb squad?" and the shorter one said, "Right," and I convoyed them to the office. Cramer, on his feet, returned their salute, pointed to the carton, and said, "It may be just corn. I mean the kind of corn you eat. Or it may not. Nero Wolfe thinks not. He also thinks it’s safe until the flaps are opened, but you’re the experts. As soon as you know, phone me here. How long will it take?" <==
"That depends, Inspector. It could be an hour, or ten hours - or it could be never."
"I hope not never. Will you call me here as soon as you know?" "Yes, sir."
The other one, the taller one, had stooped to press his ear against the carton and kept it there. He raised his head, said, "No comment," eased his fingers under the carton’s bottom, a hand at each side, and came up with it. I said, "The man who brought it carried it by the cord," and got ignored. They went, the one with the carton in front, and I followed to the stoop, watched them put it in the bus, and

 returned to the office. Cramer was in the red leather chair, and Wolfe was speaking.

"... But if you insist, very well. My reason for thinking it may contain an explosive is that it was brought by a stranger. My name printed on it was as usual, but naturally such a detail would not be overlooked.

"My God, you can lie."
Wolfe tapped the desk with a fingertip. "Mr. Cramer. If you insist on lies you’ll get them. Until I know what’s in that carton. Then we’ll see." He picked up his book, opened to his place, and swiveled to get the light right.
Cramer was stuck. He looked at me, started to say something, and vetoed it. He couldn’t get up and go because he had told the Bomb Squad to call him there, but an inspector couldn’t just sit. He took a cigar from a pocket, looked at it, put it back, arose, came to me, and said, "I’ve got some calls to make." Meaning he wanted my chair, which was a good dodge since it got some action; I had to move. He stayed at the phone nearly half an hour, making four or five calls, none of which sounded important, then got up and went over to the big globe and started studying geography. Ten minutes was enough for that, and he switched to the bookshelves. Back at my desk, leaning back with my legs crossed, my hands clasped behind my head, I noted which books he took out and looked at. Now that I knew who had killed Ken Faber, little things like that were interesting. The one he looked at longest was The Coming Fury, by Bruce Carton. He was still at that when the phone rang. I turned to get it, but by the time I had it to my ear he was there. A man asked for Inspector Cramer and I handed it to him and permitted myself a grin as I saw Wolfe put his book down and reach for his phone. He wasn’t going to take hearsay, even from an inspector.
It was a short conversation; Cramer’s end of it wasn’t more than twenty words. He hung up and went to the red leather chair. "Okay," he growled. "If you had opened that carton they wouldn’t have found all the pieces. You didn’t think it was dynamite, you knew it was. Talk."

"... But if you insist, very well. My reason for thinking it may contain an explosive is that it was brought by a stranger. My name printed on it was as usual, but naturally such a detail would not be overlooked. There are a number of people in the metropolitan area who have reason to wish me ill, and it would be imprudent - "
"My God, you can lie."
Wolfe tapped the desk with a fingertip. "Mr. Cramer. If you insist on lies you’ll get them. Until I know what’s in that carton. Then we’ll see." He picked up his book, opened to his place, and swiveled to get the light right.
Cramer was stuck. He looked at me, started to say something, and vetoed it. He couldn’t get up and go because he had told the Bomb Squad to call him there, but an inspector couldn’t just sit. He took a cigar from a pocket, looked at it, put it back, arose, came to me, and said, "I’ve got some calls to make." Meaning he wanted my chair, which was a good dodge since it got some action; I had to move. He stayed at the phone nearly half an hour, making four or five calls, none of which sounded important, then got up and went over to the big globe and started studying geography. Ten minutes was enough for that, and he switched to the bookshelves. Back at my desk, leaning back with my legs crossed, my hands clasped behind my head, I noted which books he took out and looked at. Now that I knew who had killed Ken Faber, little things like that were interesting. The one he looked at longest was The Coming Fury, by Bruce Carton. He was still at that when the phone rang. I turned to get it, but by the time I had it to my ear he was there. A man asked for Inspector Cramer and I handed it to him and permitted myself a grin as I saw Wolfe put his book down and reach for his phone. He wasn’t going to take hearsay, even from an inspector.
==> It was a short conversation; Cramer’s end of it wasn’t more than twenty words. He hung up and went to the red leather chair. "Okay," he growled. "If you had opened that carton they wouldn’t have found all the pieces. You didn’t think it was dynamite, you knew it was. Talk." <==
Wolfe, his lips tight, was breathing deep. "Not me," he said. "It would have been Archie or Fritz, or both of them. And of course my house. The possibility occurred to me, and I came down, barely in time. Three minutes later ... Pfui.

 That man is a blackguard." He shook his head, as if getting rid of a fly. "Well. Shortly after ten o’clock last evening I decided how to proceed, and I sent for Saul Panzer. When he came - "
"Who put that dynamite in that carton?"
"I’m telling you. When he came I had him type something on a sheet of paper and told him to drive to Duncan McLeod’s farm this morning and give it to Mr. McLeod. Archie. You have the copy."

MEMORANDUM FROM NERO WOLFE TO DUNCAN MCLEOD
I suggest that you should have in readiness acceptable answers to the following questions if and when they are asked:
1. When did Kenneth Faber tell you that your daughter was pregnant and he was responsible?
2. Where did you go when you drove away from your farm Tuesday afternoon around two o’clock - perhaps a little later - and returned around seven o’clock, late for milking?
3. Where did you get the piece of pipe? Was it on your premises?

2. Where did you go when you drove away from your farm Tuesday afternoon around two o’clock - perhaps a little later - and returned around seven o’clock, late for milking?
3. Where did you get the piece of pipe? Was it on your premises?
4. Do you know that your daughter saw you leaving the alley Tuesday afternoon? Did you see her?
5. Is it true that the man with the bulldozer told you Monday night that he would have to come Wednesday instead of Thursday?
There are many questions you may be asked; these are only samples. If competent investigators are moved to start inquiries of this nature, you will of course be in a difficult position, and it would be well to anticipate it.
==> Cramer looked up and aimed beady eyes at Wolfe. "You knew last night that McLeod killed Faber." <==
"Not certain knowledge. A reasoned conclusion."


"You knew he left his farm Tuesday afternoon. You knew his daughter saw him at the alley. You knew - "
"No. Those were conclusions." Wolfe turned a palm up. "Mr. Cramer. You sat there yesterday morning and read a document sworn to by Mr. Goodwin and me. When you finished it you knew everything that I knew, and I have learned nothing since then. From the knowledge we shared I had concluded that McLeod had killed Faber. You haven’t. Shall I detail it?"

When you finished it you knew everything that I knew, and I have learned nothing since then. From the knowledge we shared I had concluded that McLeod had killed Faber. You haven’t. Shall I detail it?" <==
"Yes."
"First, the corn. I presume McLeod told you, as he did me, that he had Faber pick the corn because he had to dynamite some stumps and rocks."
"Yes."
"That seemed to me unlikely. He knows how extremely particular I am, and also the restaurant. We pay him well, more than well; it must be a substantial portion of his income. He knew that young man couldn’t possibly do that job. It must have been something more urgent than stumps and rocks that led him to risk losing such desirable customers. Second, the pipe. It was chiefly on account of the pipe that I wanted to see Mr. Heydt, Mr. Maslow, and Mr. Jay. Any man - "
"When did you see them?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 73797    window = 73792 73802


Wolfe nodded. "Precisely. And I saw and heard her. And there was only one way she could know they hadn’t, with such certainty in her words and voice and manner: She knew who had. Did you form that conclusion?"
"Yes."
"Then why didn’t you go on? If she hadn’t killed him herself but knew who had, and it wasn’t one of those three men - isn’t it obvious?"
"You slipped that in, if she hadn’t killed him herself. Why hadn’t she?"
A corner of Wolfe’s mouth went up. "There it is, your one major flaw: a distorted conception of the impossible. You will reject as inconceivable such a phenomenon as a man being at two different spots simultaneously, though any adroit trickster could easily contrive it; but you consider it credible that that young woman - even after you had studied her conversation with Mr. Goodwin and me - that she concealed that piece of pipe on her person and took it there with the intention of crushing a man’s skull with it. Preposterous. That is inconceivable." He waved it away. "Of course that’s academic, now that that wretch has betrayed himself by sending me dynamite instead of corn, and the last step to my conclusion was inevitable. Since she knew who had killed Faber but wouldn’t name him, and it wasn’t one of those three, it was her father; and since she was certain - I heard and saw her say, ‘They didn’t’ - she had seen him there. I doubt if he knew it, because - but that’s immaterial. So much for - "
==> He stopped because Cramer was up, coming to my desk. He picked up the phone, dialed, and in a moment said, "Irwin? Inspector Cramer. I want Sergeant Stebbins." After another moment: "Purley? Get Carmel, the sheriff’s office. Ask him to get Duncan McLeod and hold him, and no mistake... Yes, Susan McLeod’s father. Send two men to Carmel and tell them to call in as soon as they arrive. Tell Carmel to watch it, McLeod is down for murder and he may be <==

 rough... No, that can wait. I’ll be there soon - half an hour, maybe less."
He hung up, about-faced to Wolfe, and growled, "You knew all this Wednesday afternoon, two days ago."
Wolfe nodded. "And you have known it since yesterday morning. It’s a question of interpretation, not of knowledge. Will you please sit? As you know, I like eyes at my level. Thank you. Yes, as early as Wednesday afternoon, when Miss McLeod left, I was all but certain of the identity of the murderer, but I took the precaution of seeing those three men that evening because it was just possible that one of them would disclose something cogent. They didn’t. When you came yesterday morning with that warrant, I gave you that document for two reasons: to keep Mr. Goodwin out of jail, and to share my knowledge with you. I wasn’t obliged to share also my interpretation of it. Any moment since yesterday noon I have rather expected to hear that Mr. McLeod had been taken into custody, but no."
"So you decided to share your interpretation with him instead of me."

"So you decided to share your interpretation with him instead of me."
"I like that," Wolfe said approvingly. "That was neat. I prefer to put it that I decided not to decide. Having given you all the facts I had, I had met my obligation as a citizen and a licensed private detective. I was under no compulsion, legal or moral, to assume the role of a nemesis. It was only conjecture that Faber had told Mr. McLeod that he had debauched his daughter, but he had told others, and McLeod must have had a potent motive, so it was highly probable. If so, the question of moral turpitude was moot, and I would not rule on it. Since I had given you the facts, I thought it only fair to inform Mr. McLeod that he was menaced by a logical conclusion from those facts; and I did so. I used Mr. Panzer as my messenger because I chose not to involve Mr. Goodwin. He was unaware of the conclusion I had reached, and if I had told him there might have been disagreement regarding the course to take. He can be - uh - difficult."
==> Cramer grunted. "Yeah. He can. So you deliberately warned a murderer. Telling him to have answers ready. Nuts. You expected him to lam." <==
"No. I had no specific expectation. It would have been idle to speculate, but if I had, I doubt if I would have expected him to scoot. He couldn’t take his farm along, and he would be leaving his daughter in mortal jeopardy. I didn’t

 consciously speculate, but my subconscious must have, for suddenly, when I was busy at the potting bench, it struck me. Saul Panzer’s description of McLeod’s stony face as he read the memorandum; the stubborn ego of a self-righteous man; dynamite for stumps and rocks; corn; a closed carton. Most improbable. I resumed the potting. But conceivable. I dropped the trowel and went to the elevator, and within thirty seconds after I emerged in the hall the carton came."
"Luck," Cramer said. "Your goddam incredible luck. If it had made mincemeat of Goodwin you might have been willing to admit for once - Okay, it didn’t." He got up. "Stick around, Goodwin. They’ll want you at the DA’s office, probably in the morning." To Wolfe: "What if that phone call had said the carton held corn, just corn? You think you could have talked me off, don’t you?"
"I could have tried."

"By God. Talk about stubborn egos." Cramer shook his head. "That break you got on the carton. You know, any normal man, if he got a break like that, coming down just in the nick of time, what any normal man would do, he would go down on his knees and thank God. Do you know what you’ll do? You’ll thank you. I admit it would be a job for you to get down on your knees, but - "
The phone rang. I swiveled and got it, and a voice I recognized asked for Inspector Cramer. I turned and told him, "Purley Stebbins," and he came and took it. The conversation was even shorter than the one about the carton, and Cramer’s part was only a dozen words and a couple of growls. He hung up, went and got his hat, and headed for the hall, but a step short of the door he stopped and turned.
"I might as well tell you," he said. "It’ll give you a better appetite for dinner, even if it’s not corn. About an hour ago Duncan McLeod sat or stood or lay on a pile of dynamite and it went off. They’ve got his head and some other pieces. They’ll want to decide whether it was an accident or he did it. Maybe you can help them interpret the facts."
He turned and went.

Bonny Kirk had last been seen alive, to present knowledge, by a man from a package store who had delivered a bottle of vodka to her at the apartment door, and been paid by her, a little before one o’clock Monday afternoon. The unopened vodka bottle, found under the couch with blood on it, had been used to smash Bonny Kirk’s skull sometime between one P.M. and eight P.M. Monday, the latter limit having been supplied by the medical examiner.
Among those who had been summoned or escorted to the DA’s office were Martin Kirk, James Neville Vance, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Fougere, and Bert Odom, the janitor. Presumably some of them, perhaps all, were still there.
For all that and a lot more I’m leaving out I didn’t owe Lon anything, since on our give-and-take record to date I had a credit balance, and I didn’t mention the necktie. Of course he wanted to know who Wolfe’s client was and what about Vance, and it never hurts to have Wolfe’s name in the paper, not to mention mine, but since the whole point was that Wolfe was short on clients I decided to save it. Naturally he didn’t believe it, that Wolfe had no client, and when I got up to go he said, "No welcome and no fare you well either."
I took a taxi because Wolfe likes to find me in the office when he comes down from the plant rooms at six o’clock, and he pays me and I had spent the day on personal chores, but with the traffic at that hour I might as well have walked, and it was ten past six when the hackie finally made it. As I was climbing out, a car I recognized pulled up just behind, and as I stood a man I also recognized got out of it - a big solid specimen with a big red face topped by an old felt hat even on a hot August day. As he approached I greeted him, "I’ll be damned. You yourself?"
==> Ignoring me, he called to my hackie, "Where did you get this fare?" Apparently the hackie recognized Inspector Cramer of Homicide South, for he called back, "Forty-second and Lexington, Inspector." <==
"All right, move on." To me: "We’ll go in."
I shook my head. "I’ll save you the trouble. Mr. Wolfe has a new book and there’s no point in annoying him. The tie was mailed to me, not him, and he knows nothing about it and doesn’t want to."
"I’d rather get that from him. Come on."

Nothing doing. He’s sore enough as it is, and so am I. I’ve wasted a day. I’ve learned that the spot on the tie is human blood, but what - "

 Try it."
"Archie." He turned a palm up. "You would have to say yes or no. The way I do it, you can biaiser if you wish."
I had to ask him how to spell it so I could look it up when I went to the office. Sitting, I picked up the Times, and my brow went up when I saw that it had made the front page. Probably on account of Martin Kirk; the Times loves architects as much as it hates disk jockeys and private detectives. It had nothing useful to add to what I had got from Lon, but it mentioned that Mrs. Kirk had been born in Manhattan, Kansas. Any other paper which had dug up that detail would have had a feature piece about born in Manhattan and died in Manhattan.
After three griddle cakes with homemade sausage and one with thyme honey, and two cups of coffee, I made it to the office in time to have the desks dusted, fresh water in the vase, biaiser looked up, and the mail opened, when Wolfe came down from the plant rooms. I waited until the orchids were in the vase and he had sat and glanced through the mail to tell him that it now looked as if someone had sent me a hot piece of evidence in a homicide, and I intended to find out why, of course on my own time, and anyway he wouldn’t be needing me since apparently there was nobody that needed him.
His lips tightened. "Evidence? Merely a conjecture."
==> "No, sir. I took it to Ludlow and it’s human blood. So I gave it to Cramer. Of <==
course you’ve read the Times?" "Yes."
"The blood is the same type as Mrs. Kirk’s. If it was or is a floundering numskull, obviously I’d better see - "
The doorbell rang.
I got up and went, telling myself it was even money it was James Neville Vance, but it wasn’t. A glance at the one-way glass panel in the front door settled that. It was a panhandler who had run out of luck and started ringing doorbells - a tall, lanky one pretending he had to lean against the jamb to keep himself upright. Opening the door, I said politely, "It’s a hard life. Good morning."
He got me in focus with bleary eyes and said, "I would like to see Nero Wolfe.

"Neither. He’s had no sleep and not much to eat. Tell him to come this evening, say nine o’clock, if he’s awake, and report on his talk with Mr. Vance."
"You tell him," I said and hung up. Being a salaried employee, I should of course keep my place in the presence of company, and that’s exactly what I was doing, keeping my place. I had had enough and then some, and Wolfe’s glare, which of course came automatically, was wasted because my head was turned and he had my profile, including the set of my jaw. When Rita was through with the phone he took it, spoke briefly with his client, cradled it, and looked at the clock. Six minutes to lunch.

Do you want me any more?" she asked him. "I’d like to go." "Later perhaps," he said. "If you’ll phone a little after six?"
I got up and spoke. "If you don’t mind, Mrs. Fougere." I crossed to the door to the front room and opened it. "If you’ll wait in here just a few minutes?"
==> She looked at Wolfe, saw that he had no comment, and came. When she had crossed the sill I closed the door, which is as soundproof as the wall, went to Wolfe’s desk, and said, "If it blows up in your face you’re not going to blame it on me. I merely called your attention a couple of times to the fact that a fee would be welcome. I didn’t say it was desperate, that you should grab a measly grand from a character who is probably going to be tagged for the big one. And now when he says he is going to see Vance, to handle the tie question on his own - and the tie was sent to me, not you - you not only don’t veto it, you don’t even tell me to go and sit in. Also she’s going there too, that’s obvious, and you merely tell her to phone you later. I admit you’re a genius, but when you took his check you couldn’t possibly have had the faintest idea whether he was guilty or not, and even now you don’t know the score. They may have him absolutely wrapped up. The tie was mailed to me and I gave it to Cramer, and I’m asking, not respectfully." <==
He nodded. "Well said. A good speech." "Thank you. And?"
"I didn’t tell you to go because it’s lunchtime. Also I doubt if you would get anything useful. Naturally I’ll have to see Mr. Vance - and Mr. Fougere. As for desperation, when I took Mr. Kirk’s check I knew it was extremely improbable that he had killed his wife, and I - "
"How?"
He shook his head. "You call me to account? You know everything that I know; ponder it yourself. If instead of lunch you choose to be present at a futile conversation, do so by all means. I will not be hectored into an explanation you shouldn’t need."
Fritz entered to announce lunch, saw what the atmosphere was, and stood. I went and opened the door to the front room, passed through, and told Rita, "All right, Mrs. Fougere. I’m going along."

"I agree." I sat down. "I’m up with you. There were two things. Right?" "Four."
"Then I’m shy a couple. I have his phoning and his letting me have the tie. What else?"
"Only seven ties. Why?"
"Oh." I looked at it. "Okay. And?"
"Well... take you. What have you that is a part of you? Say the relics you keep in a locked drawer. Would you give one of them to someone casually?"
==> "No." I gave that a longer look. "Uhuh," I conceded. "Check. But all four points wouldn’t convince a jury that he’s a murderer, and I doubt if they would convince Cramer or the DA that he ought to be jugged." <==
"Certainly not. We have a job before we’re ready for Mr. Cramer, and not an easy one. Phenomena needed for proof may not exist, and even if they do they may be undiscoverable. Our only recourse - "
The doorbell rang. I got up and went to the hall, took a look, stepped back into the office, and said, "Nuts. Cramer."
"No," he snapped.
"Do you want to count ten?" "No."

"Then I’m shy a couple. I have his phoning and his letting me have the tie. What else?"
"Only seven ties. Why?"

I admit it’s a pleasure to slip the bolt in, open the door the two inches the chain permits, and through the crack tell a police inspector that Mr. Wolfe is engaged and can’t be disturbed. The simple pleasures of a private detective. But that time I didn’t have it. I was still a step short of the door when a bellow came from the office, my name, and I turned and went back.

The doorbell rang. "Maybe this time you should count ten," I suggested. "No. Bring him."
==> I went. From my long acquaintance with Cramer’s face I can tell with one glance through the glass if he’s on the warpath, so I knew he wasn’t before I opened the door. He even greeted me as if it didn’t hurt. Of course he didn’t let me take his hat, that would have been going too far, but he removed it on his way down the hall. When he’s boiling he leaves it on. From the way he greeted Wolfe it seemed likely that he would have offered a hand to shake if he hadn’t known that Wolfe never did. <==
"Another hot day," he said and sat in the red leather chair, not settling back, and hanging on to his hat. "I just stopped in on my way home. You’re never on your way home, because you’re always home."
I stared at him. Unbelievable. He was chatting!
Wolfe grunted. "I go out now and then. Will you have some beer?" That was logical. If Cramer acted like a guest, he had to act like a host.
"No, thanks." Pals. "A couple of questions and I’ll go. The district attorney has about decided to hold Martin Kirk on a homicide charge. Kirk was here today for over an hour. Are you working for him?"
"Yes."

One corner of Wolfe’s mouth went up a sixteenth of an inch, his kind of a smile. "A new approach, Mr. Cramer. Rather transparent."
"The hell it is. It’s a compliment. I wouldn’t use it with any other private dick alive, and you know it. I’m not shoving, I’m just asking."
"Well. It’s barely possible ..." Wolfe focused narrowed eyes on a corner of his desk and rubbed his nose with a fingertip. Pure fake. He had had his idea, whatever it was, when he bellowed me back to the office. He held the pose for ten seconds and then moved his eyes to Cramer and said, "I know who killed Mrs. Kirk."

If you will send a man to his apartment at ten o’clock this evening to take him to you, and you keep him until you hear from me or Mr. Goodwin, and then send or bring him to me, I’ll give you enough to persuade the district attorney that he shouldn’t hold Mr. Kirk on any charge at all."
Cramer had his chin up. "Vance? Vance?" "Yes, sir."

"Merely your conjecture. I give you the fullest assurance, in good faith without reservation, that there will be no illegal entry or any other illegal act."

Wolfe nodded. "I’m prepared to. Not to give you facts, for you already have them; I’ll merely expound. You shouldn’t need it, but you have been centered on Mr. Kirk. Do you know all the details of the necktie episode? Mr. Goodwin getting it in the mail, the phone call he received, and his visit to Mr. Vance?"

"Yes."
"Then attend. Four points. First the phone call. It came at a quarter past eleven. You assume that Mr. Kirk made it, pretending he was Vance. That’s untenable, or at least implausible. How would he dare? For all he knew, Mr. Goodwin had phoned Vance or gone to see him immediately after opening the envelope. For him to phone and say he was Vance would have been asinine."
==> Cramer grunted. "He was off his hinges. The shape he was in, he wouldn’t see that." <==
"I concede the possibility. The second point. When Mr. Goodwin went to see Vance he showed him the envelope and letterhead and let him take the tie to examine it. Vance was completely mystified. You know what was said and done. He inspected the ties in his closet and said that the one that had been mailed to Mr. Goodwin was his. But when Mr. Goodwin asked for it he handed it over without hesitation. Preposterous."
Cramer shook his head. "I don’t think so. The body hadn’t been discovered. He thought it was just some screwy gag."
"Pfui. One of his ties taken from his closet, his stationery used to mail it to a private detective with a message ostensibly from him, and the phone call; and he was so devoid of curiosity or annoyance that he let Mr. Goodwin take the tie, and the envelope and letterhead, with no sign of reluctance? Nonsense."
"But he did. If he killed her, why isn’t it still nonsense?"
"Because it was part of his devious and crackbrained plan." Wolfe looked at the clock. "It’s too close to dinnertime to go into that now. It was ill-conceived and ill-executed, and it was infantile, but it wasn’t nonsense. The third point, and the most significant: two missing neckties. He had nine and had given one to Mr. Kirk, and there were only seven left. Of course you have accounted for that in your theory. How?"

Wolfe nodded. "As Vance intended you to. But have you examined that assumption thoroughly?"
"Yes. I don’t like it. That’s one reason I think the DA is moving too fast. Kirk would have been a sap to do that. Someone else could have taken it to implicate Kirk. For instance, Fougere."
"Why not Vance himself?"
"Because a man doesn’t smash a woman’s skull unless he has a damn good reason and Vance had no reason at all."
Wolfe grunted. "I challenge that, but first the fourth point. Those neckties were an integral item of James Neville Vance’s projection of his selfhood. Made exclusively for him, they were more than merely distinctive and personal; they were morsels of his ego. Conceivably he might have given one of them to someone close and dear to him, but not to Martin Kirk - not unless it was an essential step in an undertaking of vital importance. So it was."
==> "Damn it," Cramer growled, "his reason!" <==
A corner of Wolfe’s mouth went up. "Your new approach is an improvement, Mr. Cramer. You know I wouldn’t fix on a man as a murderer without a motive, so I must have one for Mr. Vance, and you want it. Not now. You would get up and go. That would be enough for you to take to the district attorney, and while it would postpone a murder charge against my client it would by no means clear him permanently, because I strongly doubt if you can get enough evidence against Vance to hold him, let alone convict him. My knowledge of Vance’s motive is by hearsay, so don’t bother to warn me about withholding evidence; I have none that you don’t have. If I get some I’ll be glad to share it. I need to know with certainty where Mr. Vance will be this evening from ten o’clock on, and when Mr. Goodwin told me that you were at the door it occurred to me that the surest way would be for you to have him with you. Do you want it in writing, signed by both of us, that there will be no illegal act - under penalty of losing our licenses?"
Cramer uttered a word about the same flavor as the one Fougere had used, but of

course there was no lady present. He followed it up. "I suppose I’d send it to the Commissioner so he could frame it?" He flattened his palms on the chair arms. "Look, Wolfe. I know you. I know you’ve got something. I admit your four points taken together add up. I’ll take your word that you won’t send Goodwin to break and enter. I know I can’t pry any more out of you even if it wasn’t time for you to eat, and anyway I eat too. But you say I’m to keep Vance until I hear from you or Goodwin, and that might mean all night, and he’s not just some bum. Nothing doing. Make it tomorrow morning, say ten o’clock, and limit it to six hours if I don’t hear from you or Goodwin, and I’ll buy it."
Wolfe grinned. "That’s better anyway. I was rushing it. I said send a man to get him."

"Very well." Wolfe turned. "Archie. Mr. Cramer and I need a few minutes to make sure of details. Tell Fritz. And use the phone in the kitchen to get Mrs. Fougere. I must see her this evening. Also get Saul and Fred and Orrie. I want them either this evening or at eight in the morning."

Cramer uttered a word about the same flavor as the one Fougere had used, but of

course there was no lady present. He followed it up. "I suppose I’d send it to the Commissioner so he could frame it?" He flattened his palms on the chair arms. "Look, Wolfe. I know you. I know you’ve got something. I admit your four points taken together add up. I’ll take your word that you won’t send Goodwin to break and enter. I know I can’t pry any more out of you even if it wasn’t time for you to eat, and anyway I eat too. But you say I’m to keep Vance until I hear from you or Goodwin, and that might mean all night, and he’s not just some bum. Nothing doing. Make it tomorrow morning, say ten o’clock, and limit it to six hours if I don’t hear from you or Goodwin, and I’ll buy it."
Wolfe grinned. "That’s better anyway. I was rushing it. I said send a man to get him."
"I heard you."
==> "Very well." Wolfe turned. "Archie. Mr. Cramer and I need a few minutes to make sure of details. Tell Fritz. And use the phone in the kitchen to get Mrs. Fougere. I must see her this evening. Also get Saul and Fred and Orrie. I want them either this evening or at eight in the morning." <==
I rose. "Does it matter which?" "No."
I beat it to the kitchen.

IF YOU EVER NEED an operative and only the best will do, get Saul Panzer if you can. If Saul isn’t available, get Fred Durkin or Orrie Cather. That was the trio who entered James Neville Vance’s apartment with me at a quarter past ten Thursday morning.
What made the entry legal was that when I rang the bells, both downstairs and upstairs, the doors were opened from the inside. Who opened them was Rita Fougere. Upstairs she held it open until we were in and then closed it. I preferred not to touch the door - not that it mattered, but I like things neat.

The way you prowl a place depends on what you’re after. If you’re looking for one large item, say a stolen elephant, of course it’s simple. The toughest is when you’re just looking. We did want one specific item, a necktie, but also we wanted anything whatever that might help, no matter what, and Saul and Fred and Orrie had been thoroughly briefed. So we were just looking after Saul found the necktie, and that means things like inspecting the seams of a mattress and unfolding handkerchiefs and flipping through the pages of books. It takes a lot longer when you are leaving everything exactly as it was.
We had been at it over an hour when Saul found the tie. I had shown them the seven on the rack in the closet so they would know what it looked like. Saul and Orrie were up in the studio, and when I heard them coming down the spiral stair I knew they had something and met them at the foot, and Saul handed it to me. It was folded, and pinned to it was one of Vance’s engraved letterheads, on which Saul had written: "Found by me at 11:25 A.M. on August 9, 1962, inside a piano score of Scriabin’s Vers la Flamme which was in a cabinet in the studio of James Neville Vance at 219 Horn Street, Manhattan, New York City." He had signed it with his little twirl on the tail of the z.
"You’re my hero," I told him. "It would be an honor to tie your shoestrings and I want your autograph. But you know how Orrie is on gags and so do I. We’ll take a look."

entered the bedroom, with them following, and went to the closet. The seven were still on the rack; I counted them twice. "Okay," I told Saul, "it’s it. I’ll vote for you for President." I took the seven from the rack and handed them to him. "Here, we’ll take them along."
==> After that it was just looking, both in the apartment and in the studio, and that gets tedious. By two o’clock it was damn tedious because we were hungry and we had decided not to take time out to eat, but Cramer had agreed to keep Vance for six hours, and while we had Exhibit A and that was all Wolfe really expected, an Exhibit X would be deeply appreciated. So we kept at it. <==
A little before three o’clock I was standing in the middle of the living room frowning around. Rita was lying on a couch with her eyes closed. Fred was up in the studio with Saul and Orrie. I was trying to remember some little something that had been in my mind an hour ago, and finally I did. When Fred had taken a pile of gloves from a drawer he had looked in each glove but hadn’t felt in it, and he hadn’t taken them to the light. I went to the bedroom, got the gloves from the drawer, took them to the window, and really looked; and in the fifth glove, a pigskin hand-sewed number, there was Exhibit X. When I saw it inside the glove I thought it was just a gob of some kind of junk, but when I pulled it out and saw what it was I felt something I hadn’t felt very often, a hot spot at the base of my spine. I don’t often talk to myself either, but I said aloud, "Believe it or not, that’s exactly what it is. It has to be." I put it back in the glove, put the glove in my pocket, returned the other gloves to the drawer, went to the phone on the bedstand, and dialed a number.
Wolfe’s voice came: "Yes?" I’ve been trying for years to get him to answer the phone properly.
"Me," I said. "We’ll be there in less than half an hour. Saul found the tie. It was in a piano score in a cabinet in the studio. I just found Exhibit X. I can tell you what he did. After he killed her he cut off a lock of her hair with blood on it, plenty of blood, and took it for a keepsake. After the blood was dry he put it inside one of his gloves in a drawer, which is where I found it. That has to be it. You may not believe it till you see it, but you will then."
"Indeed." A pause. "Satisfactory. Very satisfactory. Bring the glove."
"Certainly. A suggestion - or call it a request. Tell Cramer to have him there at a quarter after four, or half past. We’re starving, including Mrs. Fougere, and we

"No." I was emphatic. "For once you’ll have to skip it. The six hours is up at four o’clock, and if you put it off until six Cramer may let him go home, with or without an escort, and he might find that both the tie and the keepsake are gone. Would that be satisfactory?"
Silence. "No." More silence. "Confound it." Still more. "Very well. Fritz will have something ready."

He wouldn’t have settled back if he had been the only city employee present, since he knew that almost certainly some fur was going to fly. Sergeant Purley Stebbins was there at his right on a chair against the wall. Purley never sits with his back to anyone, even his superior officer, if he can help it. James Neville Vance was on a chair facing Wolfe’s desk, between Cramer and me. Rita Fougere was on the couch at the left of my desk, and Saul and Fred and Orrie were grouped over by the big globe.

I regretted having to take my eyes away from Vance. Not that I thought he needed watching; it was just that I wanted to. You can learn things, or you think you can, from the face of a man who knows something is headed for him but doesn’t know exactly what and is trying to be ready to meet it. Up to that point Vance’s face hadn’t increased my knowledge of human nature. His lips were drawn in tight, and that made his oversized chin even more out of proportion.

 When Wolfe cued me I had to leave it. I got the seven ties from a drawer, put them in a row on Wolfe’s desk, and stood by.
"Those," Wolfe told Vance, "are the seven ties that remained on the rack in your closet. I produce them - "

Mr. Goodwin, accompanied by Mr. Panzer, Mr. Durkin, and Mr. Cather, rang the bell at Mr. Vance’s apartment and were admitted by Mrs. Fougere. She was in the apartment with Mr. Vance’s knowledge and consent, having gone there earlier to talk with him. When an officer came to take him to you she remained, with no objection from him. Is that correct, Mrs. Fougere?"
"Yes." It came out a whisper, and she repeated it. "Yes." That time it was a croak.
"Is that correct, Mr. Vance?"
Vance’s drawn-in lips opened and then closed. "I don’t think ..." he mumbled. He raised his voice. "I’m not going to answer that."
"You might answer me," Cramer said. "Is it correct?" "I prefer not to answer."

"Then I’ll proceed," Wolfe said. "I produce these seven ties merely to establish them." He opened a drawer and produced Exhibit A. "Here is an eighth tie. Pinned to it is a statement written and signed by Mr. Panzer, on your stationery. I’ll read it." He did so. "Have you any comment?"
No comment. No response.
"Let me see that," Cramer growled. Of course he would; that’s why I was standing by. I took it from Wolfe and handed it over. He read the statement, twisted around for a look at Saul, and twisted the other way to hand the exhibit to Stebbins.

It’s just as well I haven’t many questions," Wolfe told Vance, "since apparently the few I do have won’t be answered. I’ll try answering them myself, and if you care to correct me, do so. I invite interruptions."

It’s just as well I haven’t many questions," Wolfe told Vance, "since apparently the few I do have won’t be answered. I’ll try answering them myself, and if you care to correct me, do so. I invite interruptions."
He cocked his head. "You realize, sir, that the facts are manifest. The problem is not what you did, or when or how, but why. As for when, you typed that envelope and message to Mr. Goodwin, using your own stationery and having found or made an opportunity to use Mr. Kirk’s typewriter, at least three weeks ago, since that machine wasn’t available after July nineteenth. Mr. Kirk’s disposing of it just then was of course coincidental. So your undertaking was not only premeditated, it was carefully planned. Also you retrieved the tie you had given Mr. Kirk before he moved from his apartment. Using the typewriter and retrieving the tie of course presented no difficulty, since you owned the house and had master keys. Any comment?"
"No."
"Then I’ll continue. Only the whys are left, and I’ll leave the most important one, why you killed her, to the last. For some of them I can offer only conjecture - for instance, why you wished to implicate Mr. Kirk. It may have been a fatuous effort to divert attention from yourself, or, more likely, you merely wanted it known that Mrs. Kirk had not been the victim of some chance intruder, or you had an animus against Mr. Kirk. Any of those would serve. For other whys I can do better than conjecture. Why did you take a tie from your closet and hide it in your studio? That was part of the design to implicate Mr. Kirk, and it was rather shrewd. You calculated - "

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74489    window = 74484 74494


 someone, an essential step in the scheme to involve Mr. Kirk, but why Mr. Goodwin? That’s the point I’m chiefly curious about, and I would sincerely appreciate an answer. Why did you send the tie to Mr. Goodwin?"
"I didn’t."
"Very well, I can’t insist. It’s only that he is my confidential assistant, and I would like to know how you got the strange notion that he would best serve your purpose. He is inquisitive, impetuous, alert, skeptical, pertinacious, and resourceful - the worst choice you could possibly have made. One more why before the last and crucial one: why did you phone Mr. Goodwin to burn the tie? That was unnecessary, because his curiosity was sufficiently aroused without that added fillip; and it was witless, because whoever phoned must have known that he had not already phoned you or gone to see you, and only you could have known that. Do you wish to comment?"
"I didn’t phone him."
I must say that Vance was showing more gumption than I had expected. By letting Wolfe talk he was finding out exactly how deep the hole was, and he was saying nothing.
==> Wolfe turned a hand over. "Now the primary why: why did you kill her? I learned yesterday that you probably had an adequate motive, but as I told Mr. Cramer, that was only hearsay. I had to have a demonstrable fact, an act or an object, and you supplied it. Not yesterday or today; you supplied it Tuesday afternoon when, after killing Mrs. Kirk, you stooped over her battered skull, or knelt or squatted, and cut off a lock of her hair, choosing one that had her blood on it. With a knife, or scissors? Did you stoop, or squat, or kneel?" <==
Vance’s lips moved, but no sound came. Unquestionably he was trying to say "I didn’t" but couldn’t make it.
Wolfe grunted. "I said a demonstrable fact. To demonstrate is to establish as true, and I’ll establish it. Mr. Goodwin found the lock of hair, caked with blood, some two hours ago, in a drawer in your bedroom. He called it a keepsake, but a keepsake is something given and kept for the sake of the giver, a token of friendship. Trophy would be a better term." He opened a desk drawer.
I can move fast and so can Purley Stebbins, but we both misjudged James Neville Vance, at least I did. When he started up at sight of the glove Wolfe took

 from the drawer I started too, but I wasn’t expecting him to dart like lightning, and he did; and he got the glove, snatched it out of Wolfe’s hand. Of course he didn’t keep it long. I came from his left side and Purley from his right, and since he had the glove in his right hand it was Purley who got his wrist and twisted it, and the glove dropped to the floor.

Wolfe stood up. "It’s in the glove," he told Cramer. "Mr. Goodwin, will furnish any details you require, and Mrs. Fougere." He headed for the door. The clock said 5:22. His schedule had hit a snag, but by gum it wasn’t wrecked.

A LITTLE BEFORE FIVE o’clock one afternoon last week the doorbell rang, and through the one-way glass I saw Martin Kirk on the stoop, his overcoat collar turned up and his hat on tight. When I opened the door snow came whirling in. Obviously he was calling on me, not Wolfe, since he knew the schedule, and I was glad to see an ex-client who had paid his bill promptly, so I took his hat and coat and put them on the rack, and ushered him to the office and a chair. When we had exchanged a few remarks about the weather, and his health and mine, and Wolfe’s, and he had declined an offer of a drink, he said he saw that Vance’s lawyer was trying a new approach on an appeal, and I said yeah, when you’ve got money you can do a lot of dodging. With that disposed of, he said he often wondered where he would be now if he hadn’t come straight to Wolfe from the DA’s office that day in August.
"Look," I said, "you’ve said that before. I have all the time there is and I enjoy your company, but you didn’t come all the way here through the worst storm this winter just to chew the fat. Something on your mind?"
He nodded. "I thought you might know - might have an idea." "I seldom do, but it’s possible."

 from the drawer I started too, but I wasn’t expecting him to dart like lightning, and he did; and he got the glove, snatched it out of Wolfe’s hand. Of course he didn’t keep it long. I came from his left side and Purley from his right, and since he had the glove in his right hand it was Purley who got his wrist and twisted it, and the glove dropped to the floor.
Cramer picked it up. Purley had Vance by the right arm, and I had him by the left.
==> Wolfe stood up. "It’s in the glove," he told Cramer. "Mr. Goodwin, will furnish any details you require, and Mrs. Fougere." He headed for the door. The clock said 5:22. His schedule had hit a snag, but by gum it wasn’t wrecked. <==

A LITTLE BEFORE FIVE o’clock one afternoon last week the doorbell rang, and through the one-way glass I saw Martin Kirk on the stoop, his overcoat collar turned up and his hat on tight. When I opened the door snow came whirling in. Obviously he was calling on me, not Wolfe, since he knew the schedule, and I was glad to see an ex-client who had paid his bill promptly, so I took his hat and coat and put them on the rack, and ushered him to the office and a chair. When we had exchanged a few remarks about the weather, and his health and mine, and Wolfe’s, and he had declined an offer of a drink, he said he saw that Vance’s lawyer was trying a new approach on an appeal, and I said yeah, when you’ve got money you can do a lot of dodging. With that disposed of, he said he often wondered where he would be now if he hadn’t come straight to Wolfe from the DA’s office that day in August.
"Look," I said, "you’ve said that before. I have all the time there is and I enjoy your company, but you didn’t come all the way here through the worst storm this winter just to chew the fat. Something on your mind?"
He nodded. "I thought you might know - might have an idea." "I seldom do, but it’s possible."
"It’s Rita. You know she’s in Reno?"

"Mr. Goodwin's trip. To Racine."
"You didn't authorize it. I sent him." Wolfe pushed his chair back and stood up. "You will excuse me. I have an appointment. I'm sorry I undertook that job; it was frivolous. And I deplore your misfortune." He headed for the door.
He was fudging. It was 3:47, and his afternoon session in the plant rooms was from four to six.

Fifty hours went by.
==> Like you and everyone else, I have various sources of information about what goes on: newspapers, magazines, radio, television, taxicab drivers, random talk here and there, friends, and enemies. I also have two special ones: Lon Cohen, confidential assistant to the publisher of the Gazette, and a woman who is on intimate terms, not familial, with a certain highly distinguished citizen, for whom I once did a big favor. But the news of the arrest of Dunbar Whipple came from none of those sources; it came from Inspector Cramer of Homicide South, whom I couldn't exactly call an enemy and wouldn't presume to call a friend. <==
During the two days I had not only read the newspapers but had also phoned Lon Cohen a couple of times to ask if there was anything hot about the Susan Brooke murder that wasn't being printed. There wasn't, unless you would call it hot that her brother Kenneth had socked an assistant district attorney on the beak, or that there was nothing to the rumor that it was being hushed up that she had been pregnant. She hadn't been. Of course a lot was being printed: that her handbag, on a table in the apartment, had had more than a hundred dollars in it; that an expensive gold pin had been on her dress and a ring with a big emerald had been on her finger (I had seen the ring); that she had bought a bottle of wine at a package store, and several items at a delicatessen, shortly before eight o'clock; that her mother was prostrated and inaccessible; that everyone at the ROCC had been or was being questioned; and so on. The News came out ahead on shots of Susan Brooke, with one in a bikini on a Puerto Rico beach, but the Gazette had the best one of Dunbar Whipple. Handsome and jaunty.
I wasn't surprised when, at 6:03 Thursday afternoon, Inspector Cramer showed. I

 had been expecting him or Sergeant Purley Stebbins, or at least a phone call, since Wednesday noon, when Lily Rowan had phoned to tell me she had had an official caller. Of course they had done a routine check on Susan Brooke's recent activities, of course someone at the ROCC had told them about her lunch with Miss Lily Rowan and Lily's contribution to the cause, of course they had called on Miss Rowan, and of course Lily had told the caller about me, since someone else would - for instance, the hallman - if she didn't. So I had been expecting company, and when the doorbell rang and I saw Cramer's burly figure and round red face and battered old felt hat on the stoop, I went and opened up and said, peeved, "You took your time. We've been expecting you for days."
He spoke to me as he entered. Sometimes he doesn't; he just tramps down the hall. The fact that he spoke, and even thanked me for taking his hat and coat, showed that he had come not to claim but to ask. When he entered the office, naturally he didn't offer a hand, since he knows that Wolfe is not a shaker, but before he lowered his fanny onto the red leather chair he uttered a polite greeting and actually made a try at being sociable by asking, "And how are the orchids?"

Wolfe's brows went up. "Passable, thank you. A pot of Miltonia roezli has fourteen scapes."
"Is that so." Cramer sat and pulled his feet in. "Busy? Am I interrupting something?"

"No, sir."

"Yes. None."
"I thought possibly you were on a job for Dunbar Whipple. I thought possibly he hired you when he was here Tuesday with his father."
"No. It didn't seem to me that he was sufficiently menaced to require my services."

"Yes. None."
"I thought possibly you were on a job for Dunbar Whipple. I thought possibly he hired you when he was here Tuesday with his father."
"No. It didn't seem to me that he was sufficiently menaced to require my services."
==> Cramer nodded. "That's possible. It's also possible that it seemed to you he was a murderer, so you bowed out. I say 'bowed out' because you did have a client. His father." <==

Did I?"
"Sure. We know all about that, including Goodwin's trip to Racine. Since you're out of it, I might as well be frank. He's at the district attorney's office and when he leaves he'll be taken to a cell. He'll be formally charged in the morning. I'll - "
"Murder?"
"Yes. I'll frankly admit that if you had told me you had taken him on I would have expected answers to a lot of questions, and Goodwin would have been wanted downtown. Now he may not have to go." He turned to me. "In your check on Susan Brooke, what did you find out about her relations with Dunbar Whipple?"

He turned to me. "In your check on Susan Brooke, what did you find out about her relations with Dunbar Whipple?"
==> I looked at Wolfe. He shook his head and looked at Cramer. "If you please. Is the decision definite to hold Dunbar Whipple without bail on a murder charge?" <==
"Yes. That's why I'm here."
"Has he a lawyer?"
"Yes. He's at the district attorney's office now.
"His name, please?"
"Why?"

"Has he a lawyer?"
"Yes. He's at the district attorney's office now.
"His name, please?"
"Why?"
Wolfe turned a palm up. "Must I get it from the morning paper?"
==> Cramer turned both palms up. "Harold R. Oster. A Negro. Counsel for the Rights of Citizens Committee." <==
Wolfe's eyes came to me. "Archie, get Mr. Parker."
I got the phone. I didn't have to consult the book for either of the numbers, office or home, of Nathaniel Parker, the member of the bar. Knowing he was often at his office after hours I tried that one first and got him. Wolfe took his phone, and I stayed on.
"Mr. Parker? I need some information confidentially. You will not be quoted. Do you know a lawyer named Harold R. Oster?"



[line number in individual story] matching line = 1697    window = 1692 1702

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74933    window = 74928 74938


"Yes."
"Are you on that?"
"I merely want information."
"You usually do. Well... confidentially, I would say no. He has ability, no doubt of that, but in my opinion he might take a wrong line in a case where - a Negro killing a white woman. I mean charged with killing her. If I were Dunbar Whipple, I would want a different kind of man. Of course I may be completely wrong, but - "
"Enough, Mr. Parker, wrong or not. Thank you. You won't be quoted." Wolfe hung up and turned. "Archie. Did Dunbar Whipple kill Susan Brooke?"
==> I know him so well. Anyone might suppose he was showing off to Cramer, showing him how eccentric and unique he was, but no. He merely wanted to know what I would say. If we had been alone I would have told him that one would get him ten that Dunbar was innocent, but with Cramer there I preferred to skip the odds. <==
"No," I said.
He nodded. "Get Mr. Whipple."
Before turning to the phone I shot a glance at Cramer. Chin down, eyes narrowed, and lips tight, he was glued to Wolfe. He knows him fairly well too, and he suspected what was coming. It would have cramped Wolfe's style a little if Whipple hadn't been at home, but he was.
He answered the phone. I started to tell him that Mr. Wolfe wanted to speak to him, but Wolfe was at his phone and cut in.

He answered the phone. I started to tell him that Mr. Wolfe wanted to speak to him, but Wolfe was at his phone and cut in.

"This is Nero Wolfe, Mr. Whipple. Can you hear me?" "Yes."
"I owe you an apology. You were right, and I was wrong. I have just learned that your son is being held on a charge of murder. I am convinced that the charge is unfounded. If you want my services on your son's behalf, I offer them without fee. My previous undertaking to discharge my obligation to you was fatuous; I should have said no. Now I say yes."
Silence. Then: "His lawyer phoned an hour ago that he would probably be home by eight o'clock."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74947    window = 74942 74952


"His lawyer was wrong. I have more accurate information. Do you accept my offer?"
"Yes. Of course. We'll pay all we can."
"You'll pay nothing. My self-esteem needs repairs. But there's a question: the approval of your son and his lawyer."
"They'll approve. I know they will. But how did you learn - are you sure..."
"Yes. A policeman is sitting here in the chair you sat in. When you have the approval of your son and his lawyer, let me know and I'll proceed. I must talk with you and the lawyer."
==> "Of course. I knew this - I knew it would happen, but now that - now that - " "Yes. Some time has been lost. Let me know." He hung up and swiveled. Cramer asked, cold and slow, "What kind of a goddam play is this?" <==
Wolfe pinched his nose. "I believe I have never told you of an experience I had years ago at a place in West Virginia. I wanted to leave and come home, and I wanted a certain favor from a certain man. A young colored man made it possible for me to realize both desires. His name was Paul Whipple. I hadn't seen him since until ten days ago - no, eleven. Now I'll even the score."

The hell you will. You can't possibly know that Dunbar Whipple didn't kill that girl. The only way you could know that would be if you thought you knew who did kill her."
"I haven't the slightest idea who killed her."
"I don't believe you. It's obvious that when Goodwin was checking on her he dug up something that you intend to use to pull one of your goddam fancy stunts. You're not going to. I told you that if you had taken him on Goodwin would have been wanted downtown, and now I'm telling you that I'm taking you too. To the district attorney." He rose. "If you want it done right, you're under arrest as material witness. Come on."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1718    window = 1713 1723

"If you want it done right, you're under arrest as material witness. Come on."
Wolfe, in no hurry, put his hands on the desk rim to push his chair back, arose, and got the edge of his vest between thumbs and forefingers to pull it down. "We shall of course stand mute and get bail tomorrow. May we have two minutes to call Mr. Parker? Get him, Archie."
==> I slanted my eyes up at Cramer, waiting politely for permission, since I was under arrest. He stood and breathed for ten seconds. He spoke. "You told Whipple that the charge against his son is unfounded. Let's hear you reply to what I said, that if you say Dunbar Whipple didn't kill her you think you know who did." <==
"I did reply. I have no idea who killed her." "Then why didn't he?"
"I am not obliged to account for a conclusion I have formed. But I tell you on my word of honor - a phrase I respect, as you know - that the conclusion has no evidential basis. I know nothing of the circumstances that led to the death of Susan Brooke that you don't know; indeed, I know much less than you do. I offer a suggestion. I am now committed to act in the interest of Mr. Whipple, I would like to proceed without delay, and I would rather not spend tonight and part of tomorrow in custody, mute or not. I'm going to ask Mr. Goodwin to type a full report, with all conversations verbatim, of his investigation of Susan Brooke, and I offer to send you a copy of it, with his affidavit. That should satisfy you."
"What about you?"

Dismiss me. All my knowledge of the matter will be contained in Mr. Goodwin's report. Still my word of honor."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74963    window = 74958 74968



Dismiss me. All my knowledge of the matter will be contained in Mr. Goodwin's report. Still my word of honor."
"When will I get the report?"
"I can't say. How long will it take, Archie?"
"It depends," I told him. "If you want it all, every word, say forty hours. Three days and evenings. I talked with many people about many things. If you want only what could possibly be relevant, ten or twelve hours should do it. The affidavit could cover it."
==> "Tomorrow afternoon," Cramer said. "By five o'clock." "Maybe, but no guarantee." <==
He regarded Wolfe, opened his mouth and closed it again, about-faced, and was going. Wolfe raised his voice to tell his back, "We are under arrest!"
"Balls," Cramer said without stopping. As I got up and went to the hall to see that he was outside when the door shut, I was thinking that you couldn't blame him for being rude. He was facing the fact that they were slapping the big one on a man that Nero Wolfe had decided to take on. I didn't offer to help him with his hat and coat; it wouldn't have been appreciated. When he was out and the door shut I stepped back in the office. Wolfe was back in his chair, looking sour.
I went to my desk and sat. "At least twelve hours," I said. "I might as well be in jail."
I swiveled, got out paper and carbons, and swung the typewriter around. "What are you doing?" he demanded.
"Starting that damn report."

"Waste of time. Anyway, didn't I say no?"
"Yes. Why?"
I swiveled to face him. "You know why, since you phoned Whipple. When he

 barked at you, "What did you do, what did you do," I thought to myself, so he didn't kill her. If he had killed her of course he would be putting on an act, but that act was just too good. Only a genius could be that good, and I've never seen any genius besides you. Then when he told me I knew who killed her. Then when he apologized to you. Do I have to go on?"
==> "No. It was manifest. He couldn't possibly have been dissembling. You're aware that the report is required not only for Mr. Cramer. I must have it." <==
"Sure. Proceeding as usual. Giving me a long, mean, extremely difficult job." I turned and got at the paper and carbons.

It took eleven hours plus, four hours Thursday evening and most of Friday. Thirty-two pages and the affidavit. That may seem slow, but for most of it I had no notes. At a quarter past four Friday afternoon I put it in an envelope with a label addressed to Inspector Cramer, took it to a notary public on Eighth Avenue to have the affidavit made official, and then, in a taxi, to Homicide South on 20th Street. I also took a taxi back. It was a nice sunny winter day for a walk, but the Gazette was on the stands and there was an item in it which I wanted to enjoy at leisure.
There had been interruptions. Whipple had phoned late Thursday evening to say that Oster, the lawyer, had been glad to hear that he would have Nero Wolfe's help and had approved on behalf of his client. At eight-thirty Friday morning, already at my desk, I was buzzed by Wolfe on the house phone from his room and instructed to call Lon Cohen and tell him that if he cared to send a reporter to 35th Street we would have an item that might be printable; and furthermore I was told to send the reporter up to the plant rooms if he came between nine and eleven. He came a little after ten, and Fritz took him up in the elevator. That wasn't unprecedented but it was out of the ordinary. It was too bad I couldn't tell Dunbar Whipple that, in the interest of a Negro, Wolfe was making an exception he had rarely made in the interest of any white man. I wondered then, and I still do, whether words had anything to do with it, knowing how he is about words.

 barked at you, "What did you do, what did you do," I thought to myself, so he didn't kill her. If he had killed her of course he would be putting on an act, but that act was just too good. Only a genius could be that good, and I've never seen any genius besides you. Then when he told me I knew who killed her. Then when he apologized to you. Do I have to go on?"
"No. It was manifest. He couldn't possibly have been dissembling. You're aware that the report is required not only for Mr. Cramer. I must have it."
"Sure. Proceeding as usual. Giving me a long, mean, extremely difficult job." I turned and got at the paper and carbons.

==> It took eleven hours plus, four hours Thursday evening and most of Friday. Thirty-two pages and the affidavit. That may seem slow, but for most of it I had no notes. At a quarter past four Friday afternoon I put it in an envelope with a label addressed to Inspector Cramer, took it to a notary public on Eighth Avenue to have the affidavit made official, and then, in a taxi, to Homicide South on 20th Street. I also took a taxi back. It was a nice sunny winter day for a walk, but the Gazette was on the stands and there was an item in it which I wanted to enjoy at leisure. <==

s he had told me, discussing words one evening at the dinner table, negro means black in Spanish and nero means black in Italian. And he had been born in Montenegro, Black Mountain. Maybe something buried in him but not dead, in his cesspool and/or garden.
Of the other phone calls I need to report only one, shortly after lunch, from Oster, when it was arranged that he and Whipple would come at six o'clock for a conference.
In the cab returning from 20th Street I read the item three times. It was on page 3, with the headline: NERO WOLFE SITS IN. Not bad. About anyone else it would probably have been STEPS IN.

"You're damn right I reject it." Oster turned to WhippIe. "He's impossible. Listen to him. Impossible!"
"You're a bungler," Wolfe said, not clashing, just stating a fact. Oster goggled at him, speechless.
"Even if you repudiate my assumption," Wolfe said, "as the man reponsible for Dunbar Whipple's defense you should want to know why I make it. It's tentative, merely a place to start; I must start somewhere. The most pointed known fact about the murderer is that he knew about that apartment, and that Miss Brooke was there or probably was. Since her money and jewelry were not taken, he was not a random marauder; moreover, he didn't try to pose as one by taking them. I don't suppose there were many people who knew of the apartment; apparently, from accounts and hints in the newspapers, there were very few. In an effort to find them, the most likely place should be tried first. I have a question. Dunbar Whipple is your client. If you could clear him only by exposing the real culprit, and if the culprit were someone connected with the organization of which you are the counsel, and if you had it in your power to expose him, would you do so?"
Of course he had to say yes. He added, "But that's three ifs."
"Not the first one, though I said 'if.' Come, Mr. Oster, let's be realistic. Yesterday at this hour a police inspector was sitting in that chair, and we talked at length. I believe that your client is in grave jeopardy unless we produce a substitute. Don't you?"
==> "Was it Cramer?" <==

 "Yes."
"That damned Cossack."
"Not by definition." Wolfe flipped it aside. "I won't press you for an answer; your reputation for acumen is answer enough." Vinegar, then butter. "Dunbar Whipple entered that apartment shortly after nine o'clock and remained there continuously until the police arrived some forty minutes later; he says so. The only feasible method of proving that Susan Brooke died before he arrived is to produce the person who killed her. Let's find him. The ROCC is not the place to look, certainly. Your report, Archie?"
I got it from a drawer. He asked, "You have an extra copy?"

Only two kinds of guests ever dine at that table: (a) men for whom Wolfe has personal feelings - there are eight altogether, and only two of them live in or near New York - and (b) people who are involved in his current problem. With both kinds he makes a point of steering the table talk to subjects that he thinks the guests will be interested in; for him, as he once remarked, a guest is a jewel on

cushion of hospitality - a little fancy maybe, but a fine sentiment. As Fritz was serving the mussels I was wondering what it would be for those two. It was William Shakespeare. After the skimpy portions of mussels, in white wine with creamed butter and flour, had been commented on, Wolfe asked them if they had read the book by Rowse. They hadn't. But they were interested in Shakespeare? Oh, yes. Not many lawyers or professors would dare to say no. Of course they were familiar with Othello? They were. I cocked an eye at Wolfe. Surely it wasn't very tactful, with those dinner guests to deliberately drag Othello in.
He swallowed his last bite of mussel. "There's an interesting point," he said. "A question. If the facts were established as they are presented in the play, could Iago, today in the State of New York, be legally charged with murder as an accessory, and be successfully prosecuted?"
I had to hand it to him. Unquestionably Othello concerned a subject in which they were interested, and putting the spot on Iago and a question of law made it discussable. They discussed it up one side and down the other. By the time the duck and trimmings had been disposed of, and Fritz had brought the fig souflle, it looked to me as if Iago was on the ropes.
==> Fritz answers the doorbell during meals, so when it rang as I started on my souflle I stayed put. It would be Cramer. Having read the report, he had come with questions, and they were welcome, because that was better than being invited to the DA's office. But it wasn't Cramer. The sound of voices came from the hall, Fritz's and another, and then another, not recognized. They stopped. There was no use trying to hear a door closing; not only does Fritz close doors quietly, but also Oster was talking. Fritz appeared, crossed the sill, and told Wolfe, "Two men and a woman, sir." Formerly he would have said two gentlemen and a lady, but Wolfe had stopped that. He went on, "Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Brooke and Mr. Peter Vaughn. In the front room. I told them I thought you were engaged for the evening." <==
Wolfe looked at me. I nodded, "Her brother." He told Fritz he could bring the cheese and we would have coffee there instead of in the office, and forked a bite of souffle.
Oster asked, "Susan's brother?" and I said yes. He asked Wolfe, "You weren't expecting him?"
Wolfe swallowed the bite. "Not him specifically. I was rather expecting

 someone, this evening or tomorrow. The hook I baited." In the office he would have been smug, but not with guests, at the table. "I need another hour or so with you and Mr. Whipple, but it will have to wait. Perhaps Mr. Goodwin could call at your office in the morning?"

No. If she's open to menace, the more she's stirred the better. Your notebook. Questions for Mr. Oster and Mr. Whipple. We don't want an army here. Only those who - "
"I'll get the ad in first." I got the phone and dialed.

It was a lousy weekend. Nothing went right. Nothing went exactly wrong either, but you can say that if you just go to bed and don't get up.
==> My Saturday morning date with Oster and Whipple was canceled because Oster was called to Washington for a parley at the Department of Justice. He might be back Sunday night. Saul Panzer is the best free-lance operative who ever stopped a closing door with his foot, but even Saul was stymied when he learned that the man who had been on duty that Monday evening at the garage where the Kenneth Brookes kept their two Herons was off somewhere for the weekend, nobody knew where. At four o'clock Saturday afternoon I was invited to the DA's office to discuss some selected items in the report I had delivered to Cramer, and was kept so long by an assistant district attorney named Mandel, who would enjoy looking at me through bars with him on the outside, that I was two hours late for a dancing date with friends at the Flamingo. Lon Cohen phoned once Saturday and twice Sunday. Some brainy journalist, maybe Lon himself, having seen the ad, had recalled the fact that Susan Brooke's married brother lived in the East Sixties, and of course 128th Street was obvious, and Lon wanted to know what gave. I stalled him off Saturday, but he called twice Sunday to ask if the hackie had shown. He hadn't. Not a peep. <==
A lousy weekend.
I finally got to Oster early Monday afternoon, at the office of the ROCC, a whole floor of a building on 39th Street near Lexington Avenue. It wasn't lavish, but neither was it seedy. I was a little surprised to see that the switchboard girl, who doubled in reception, was my color, even a little lighter - a middle-aged female, hair showing some gray, with a chin and a half and a long thin nose, which didn't fit. I learned later that of the total office staff of thirty-four, five were white, and of the five whites, four were volunteers, what Dolly Brooke would call do-gooders.


Oster's room was small, one window, but after a few words he took me down the hall to the corner room of the executive director, Thomas Henchy, and it was quite a chamber, with a few dozen photographs on the walls where the cabinets and shelves left room. I had seen Henchy on television a couple of times, and so have you probably - broad shoulders, cheeks a little pudgy but not flabby, short neck. Color, strong coffee with one teaspoon of cream. He got up to shake hands, and I took a little care with the grip. Men with short necks are apt to be knuckle-crushers.

"Did that woman kill her?"
"I pass. Again no odds, for a different reason. I may understand women better

han Vaughn does, I hope I do, but I pass as it stands now. The only visible motive is a little limp. If she did it to keep scandal from the family name, what about this scandal? Pass."
He straightened up. "Whether she did or not, we could have Mr. Whipple released from custody today. Tomorrow at the latest."
==> "Sure. If she sticks to the line she gave Vaughn, and she had better. She'll have to. As I told Vaughn, it's obvious that Susan wasn't in there alive when Whipple arrived. Shall I get Cramer? I promised Vaughn nothing." <==
He made a face. "I don't like it."
"You wouldn't. You're on record that the only way to clear Whipple is to produce the murderer, and she may not be it. We have found an out for him, but we can't be sure he would stay out. She might change the script and say she didn't enter the building, and we can't prove she did. I don't like it either."
"You just said she would have to stick to the line she gave Vaughn."
"I'm more vulnerable than you are. I talk too fast. As soon as I said it I realized it wasn't true."
He growled. "Confound it." He made fists and rested them on the edge of his desk. He looked at the left one, saw nothing helpful, looked at the right one, saw no better, and looked at me. "When can you get her here?"

 have to eventually, but it's barely possible that they won't. Archie?"
I arose and took the document and handed it to her and stayed on my feet, since she would soon need a pen.
"Read it," Wolfe said. "I made it as brief as possible." She was a slow reader. I thought she would never finish the first page, and she took even longer with the second. Finally she looked up. "If you think I'm going to sign this," she said, "you're crazy."
"You won't even consider it?" "I will not."
==> "Get Mr. Cramer, Archie." "Who is Mr. Cramer?" <==
"A police inspector."
I was at my desk, starting to dial.
"Don't do that!" she yelled. I could use a nicer word, but a yell is a yell. As I went on dialing, she bounced out of the chair, to me, and grabbed my arm and jerked. She turned to Wolfe and presumably was glaring; her back was to me.
"I won't squabble," Wolfe snapped. "You will sign that statement, now, or you will stay until Mr. Cramer comes." He turned his head and roared. "Saul!"
The door opened and Saul was there. "This woman prevented Archie from making a telephone call," Wolfe told him. "Don't let her do it again."

The door opened and Saul was there. "This woman prevented Archie from making a telephone call," Wolfe told him. "Don't let her do it again."
Three men and one poor little woman. Saul advanced. I lifted the receiver, which I had cradled. "Don't," she said. She touched my arm. "Please don't. I'll sign it." The document was on the floor, where it had dropped when she bounced. Saul picked it up and handed it to her. She went to the chair and sat, and I took her a pen. The little stand beside the chair was mainly for signing checks, but it would do for signing statements too.
"All three copies," Wolfe said, and I got the two carbons from a drawer and took them to her. As she did each one I took it and gave the signature a look. It

 slanted up, which I understand means something, I forget what. I went to my desk and put them in the locked drawer. Saul went over to a chair by the bookshelves.

"Sure. To get away from the DA's office without signing a statement you have to thumb your nose. She would sign."
"It would be convenient to know if Mrs. Brooke has shown talent as a mimic. Mr. Vaughn could have told you this morning."
"I knew that would be mentioned sooner or later. He could barely walk. Right now he's pounding his ear. Is it urgent?"
"No." His eyes were narrowed at me. "I presume you're aware of the situation."
==> "I am. First, if Dolly Brooke killed her we had better prove it quick or turn that document over to Cramer. That document is hot. But we can't possibly prove it. We've got her at the door, but we can't get her inside unless we dig up a motive with legs. Do we put Saul and Fred and Orrie on that for a month or so?" <==
He made a face. "No."
"Second, Beth Tiger, and on her I must get personal. I have some idea, from things you've said these two weeks, how you feel about a colored man marrying a white girl. You don't feel. How about a white man marrying a colored girl?"
"Pfui."
"You may have a surprise coming. So far it may be only lust, but as I ate breakfast this morning I caught myself wondering if she can make Creole fritters, and you know what that may mean - or I suppose you don't. My room would do for both of us for a while, until the little ones start to come, and as for their color of course I can't say. As for the professional situation, she too was in the building, and she had a much better motive than Mrs. Brooke; she wanted to marry Dunbar herself."
"Presumably."

"Oh, ask a few questions. I wish I hadn't mentioned it. It's probably nothing. I want to say I'm damned grateful to you and Wolfe, not telling the police. I was pretty sure you hadn't; they would have been at me. I'm damned grateful."
He hung up, and I was grateful to him. He had given me something to nibble at. Was there any chance he was going to produce an item we could work on, and if so, what would it be? It would have to be about Dolly Brooke, since she and Kenneth were his only connection, but it wouldn't be about the item he had just supplied, that Dolly could imitate Susan's voice, since he had asked why I asked. Yet it might. He might have asked why I asked to see if I knew something he knew or suspected. I should have hung on. I rang him. First Heron Manhattan; he hadn't been in today. Then his home; he had just gone out and they didn't know where.
When Wolfe came down from the plant rooms I reported. He listened with his eyes open, showing that he was hearing nothing that called for concentration. It was obvious that he had decided, for some reason too subtle for me to appreciate, possibly because he didn't want to see her again if he could avoid it, that Dolly Brooke wasn't it. When I suggested that it wouldn't hurt to try to find Vaughn and pry it out of him, he said pfui, Mr. Vaughn was manifestly an ass, since he hadn't even had enough gumption to slough his illusion about Miss Brooke. That was a fitting end to the day. I had enough gumption to go up to my room, ring Lucy Valdon, and invite her to dine at Rusterman's. She suggested that we eat at her house instead. Sometimes that suggestion is welcome, and it was then. It was nice and quiet there and we could laugh louder and longer. I certainly needed someone to laugh with. If Vaughn phoned, Wolfe could tell him

 where to get me. I stripped and got under the shower.
==> My morning fog begins to let little streaks of light through as I sip orange juice, and with my second cup of coffee it's all clear, so when I go to the office around nine-thirty I'm set for the day. But there are exceptions, and that Thursday morning was one. First, it was ten-thirty instead of nine-thirty. Second, I had got home at three o'clock and had had two hours' less sleep than my regulation eight. Third, there was nothing to be set for. If there had been any word from Peter Vaughn it hadn't been worth mentioning, since there had been no note on my desk when I got home. Evidently it was going to be more of the same. I had a notion to go up and get Wolfe's toothbrush and put it on his desk, on top of the mail, but that would only make it worse. I would go for a walk and not be there when he came down. That appealed to me. My watch said 10:52. I went to the kitchen and told Fritz, and to the rack in the hall for my coat, and as I was reaching for it some object dimmed the light from the glass in the door, and I turned. The object was Inspector Cramer. Good. Anything and anybody was welcome, even him, even if he had somehow learned about Dolly Brooke and intended to take us for obstructing justice. I opened the door as he started his hand for the button, and said, "Greetings. I was standing here waiting for you." <==
No comment. He was not only out of sorts, he was out of words. He took his coat off and put it on the bench, dropped his hat on it, marched to the office, looked at his watch, and stood facing the door to the hall. Going to my desk, I had a splendid view of his broad burly shoulders and his king-size fanny, motionless for a good three minutes until Wolfe entered, stopped two steps in, and glared. Cramer wheeled and went to the red leather chair. Wolfe switched the glare to me, and as he went to his desk I said, "There wasn't time to buzz you, he just came." He put a raceme of Vanda suavis in the vase, sat, and started looking through the mail, no hurry.
"Take your time," Cramer said, icy. "Take my time. We've got all day. You're going to tell me every word anyone has said in this room, including you and Goodwin, about the murder of Susan Brooke. Start with Peter Vaughn. How often has he been here, and when, and what was said?"
So it was Dolly Brooke. Her statement, all three copies, was in the safe. A safe is safer than a locked drawer.
Wolfe pushed the mail aside and swiveled. "This is extraordinary," he said, not a

Surely you don't expect to get evidence that will help convict him from me. Even if I had any I should not and would not disclose it to you. Extraordinary. Could I be wrong about the legal position? Shall I get Mr. Oster here?"

So it was Dolly Brooke. Her statement, all three copies, was in the safe. A safe is safer than a locked drawer.
Wolfe pushed the mail aside and swiveled. "This is extraordinary," he said, not a

rotest, merely an observation. "You have your murderer in custody. I have been, and am, acting in his interest as instructed by his legal attorney. Surely you don't expect to get evidence that will help convict him from me. Even if I had any I should not and would not disclose it to you. Extraordinary. Could I be wrong about the legal position? Shall I get Mr. Oster here?"
It sounded impressive, but Cramer wasn't impressed. "I know the legal position," he said, still icy. "You're not acting for Peter Vaughn, and Oster isn't his attorney. I want to know when and where you and Goodwin have seen Vaughn and what was said."

Wolfe shook his head. "Nonsense. You're rattled, and that's extraordinary too. We have seen Mr. Vaughn only in our capacity as agents for Mr. Whipple and his lawyer, and you are here in your capacity as Mr. Whipple's legal nemesis.
"No."
Wolfe's brows went up. "No?"
"I'm here in my capacity as the head of Homicide South, but not about the murder of Susan Brooke. About the murder of Peter Vaughn."
If he was after an effect he got it. My head jerked left, to Wolfe, and his jerked right, to me. From his look at me it might have been deduced that he thought I had killed Vaughn, and from my look at him it might have been deduced that I thought he had, so Cramer must have been confused.

Wolfe's head turned back. "I presume this isn't flummery; that would be fatuous. The particulars?"
"About three hours ago a passer-by looked in the window of a parked car on Second Avenue near Thirty-second Street and told a patrolman what he had seen, and the patrolman went to look. The body of a man was on the floor in front, doubled up, the head and shoulders shoved down to the floor. He had been shot on the right side, four inches below the armpit, one shot that went between his ribs and got his heart. If death had been quick, as it almost certainly had, the shot had been fired between nine o'clock and midnight. The body has been identified. Peter Vaughn. The car is the property of his father's firm, Heron Manhattan, Inc. No weapon found. Yes, I know the legal position."
I thought, Now he'll never have to answer for lying to the police. I thought that,

 because at the moment there was no other thought worth thinking.

 because at the moment there was no other thought worth thinking.
Wolfe's eyes had closed. They opened. "And Dunbar Whipple was in custody from nine o'clock to midnight?"
"You know damn well he was." "When will he be released?" "Nuts."
Wolfe nodded. "It's embarrassing, certainly. You know the annals of homicide. It's conceivable that another hand killed Peter Vaughn; it's even conceivable that there was no connection between his death and Susan Brooke's; but you don't believe it, and neither do I. You don't dare hold him. Confound it. This will make - "

"You don't mean 'smirk.' I am not doing what you think smirk means. I'm reacting not to your discomfiture but to my own vexation. Now you need a murderer, but so do I. Coming here with a startling piece of news and barking at me is futile, and you know it." He leaned back, shut his eyes, and tightened his lips.
Cramer sat and regarded him and breathed.
Wolfe straightened up and cocked his head. "Mr. Cramer. I have no information for you. Don't explode; let me explain. We - I am including Mr. Goodwin - have seen and spoken with Mr. Vaughn twice. Last Friday evening he was here for less than an hour with Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Brooke. None of them gave us any information that you did not already have. Day before yesterday, Tuesday morning, he came alone and spoke with Mr. Goodwin, again for less than an hour. I wasn't present, but Mr. Goodwin has reported to me. Mr. Vaughn had disclosed certain facts you don't know about, but it is my considered opinion that they have no bearing on his death. There are - "

"Who was he - "
"No," Wolfe snapped. "Mr. Goodwin is my agent. Archie, did he give you any hint of whom he was going to question or about what?"
"No."
"Have you any notion about it?"
It was obvious he wanted another no, so I supplied it. He turned to Cramer. "Nor have I; but I suspect that his contemplated action led to his death, and so we report the conversation. If you can learn whom he expected to question before I do, you'll get the murderer."

"I do not. I haven't even a conjecture. I have some information you don't have, but I am convinced that it has no bearing on the identity of the murderer. I have

 no conjecture on that either. That was our last word from Mr. Vaughn; he didn't call again. Before, I had an advantage: you thought Dunbar Whipple was the culprit, and I didn't. Now I have no advantage whatever. We're up the same stump."

"Indeed you won't. What effect do you think automation will have on Homo sapiens?"
==> "Go to hell," Cramer said and got up and walked out. I went to the door but didn't stick my head into the hall until the front door slammed, and then only to see that he was outside. I returned to my desk, sat, and said, "All right, discuss." <==
He said, "Ggrrrrhh."
"Then I'll discuss. You told him that what Vaughn told me Tuesday had no bearing on his death. You got me to say that I had no notion about whom Vaughn was going to question or what about, when you know darned well I had. Yesterday you weren't interested in what Vaughn told me on the phone, that Mrs. Brooke could imitate Susan's voice. If it turns out that she killed Susan and Vaughn how will you react to my discomfiture?"
"I have assumed she didn't."
"I know you have. I haven't. There has been no sign whatever that Vaughn ever had any contact with anyone involved, except the Brookes. Who else could he possibly have been going to ask a few questions?"
"I don't know. But as for Mrs. Brooke, in addition to the lack of acceptable motive, she couldn't have made that telephone call, mimicking Miss Brooke, unless she knew of the eight o'clock rendezvous, and that's unlikely; and if she didn't make the call, who did? Possibly, of course, Miss Brooke; but by no means certainly; I still question it. But the chief point about Mrs. Brooke:

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 75800    window = 75795 75805



 returning home, she told Mr. Vaughn that she had seen Mr. Whipple entering the building. Consider it. She is in the apartment, having wiped her fingerprints from the club with which she has just killed her sister-in-law; any idiot would do that. She scoots; any idiot would do that too. Outside, on the street, does she stand there until she sees Mr. Whipple arrive and enter? Nonsense. Then does she catch a glimpse of him, arriving, as she flees? Possibly; but if so, would she tell Mr. Vaughn that she saw him arrive? I don't believe it."
I looked at it for five seconds. "What else?" "Nothing ponderable."
"Okay." I stood up. "I'm taking a leave of absence without pay. Two hours or two days, I don't know."

==> He nodded. "With luck it will be two hours. Your time would be better spent on Mr. Vaughn, even with Mr. Cramer's legion underfoot." He reached for the little stack of mail. <==
I blew.
I never, in these reports, skimp any step that counts, forward or backward. If I score a point, or if I get my nose pushed in, I like to cover it. But it would be a waste of time and space to tell you, for instance, how the Park Avenue hallman reacted to the fact that this time I could talk, or how Dolly Brooke took the news, news to her, that Peter Vaughn was dead. What matters is that it wasn't a step in either direction, except for me personally, since Wolfe had already crossed her off. In less than two hours I got the kind of alibi you do get sometimes, the kind you file under finished business. At seven-forty Wednesday evening Kenneth and Dolly Brooke had sat down to dinner at the table of another couple in the same apartment house; a little before nine two other couples had joined them for an evening of bridge; and they had quit around one o'clock. I checked it with all three of the women, two in person and one on the phone, and with two of the men. When I got back to the old brownstone, Wolfe was in the dining room, halfway through lunch, and one glance at my face told him how it stood. I took my seat, and Fritz came, and I helped myself to a healthy portion of broiled shad that had been marinated in oil and lemon juice seasoned with bay leaf, thyme, and oregano, and three ladles of pureed sorrel. I took only three ladles because at bedtime I would go to the kitchen, heat the leftover sorrel, spread it on a couple of slices of Fritz's bread, and sprinkle it with nutmeg. Serve with a glass of milk. Have a spoon handy to salvage the puree that dribbles onto the plate when you bite.
When we went to the office neither of us mentioned Dolly Brooke. I merely said, as I sat, "I'll deduct twenty-two dollars for the two hours."
He grunted. "I prefer not to share the cost of this performance. I'm paying a debt." He flipped a hand to dismiss it. "Presumably Mr. Vaughn telephoned from his home."
"Only presumably. When I rang his home about half an hour later I was told he had just gone out, by a maid, on a guess."

I was on my feet, but Wolfe shook his head at me and I stayed put. My stepping to the hall for a look after the sound came of the front door closing was automatic, a habit ever since the day a bozo shut it from inside and stood near the open office door for half an hour, listening to us discuss his affairs.
I stepped back in. "Do I bother to sit?"
A corner of Wolfe's mouth was up. "You know, Archie, the most revealing manifestation of your self-esteem is not an action but an exclusion. You never crow. Nevertheless, accept my compliments."
"With pleasure. I won't deduct the twenty-two bucks. Do I sit down?" "No. Bring them."
"Now?"
==> "Yes. Mr. Cramer might get to them at any moment." <==
"It's a quarter to three. Even if I deliver them in half an hour, which is doubtful, you can't possibly do them in forty-five minutes."
"I know I can't, confound it. I owe all this to that outlandish trip to Kanawha Spa."
"But you got the recipe for saucisse minuit."
"I did indeed. Bring them. Everyone Mr. Vaughn saw or spoke with, no
exceptions. First ring Saul. We need him immediately."

"She isn't here. She wasn't here yesterday." He turned to the girl at the switchboard.
"Miss Bowen, you don't know where we're going." "Well, I don't," she said.
"Also," I suggested, "you don't know my name, and if you're asked to describe me you're not much good at describing people."
"Do I describe him wrong?" she asked Henchy.
"Yes," Oster said. "Within reason."
==> I made another suggestion, that they go ahead and I would take another elevator and also another taxi. You may think I was overdoing it, but I knew darned well what would happen the minute Cramer learned that Vaughn had gone there, if it <==

 was still office hours. I was pleased to find that there was room in my skull for still another suggestion, even though I had to veto it - the suggestion that one of them, namely Miss Tiger, might ride with me. It was nice to know that even in a crisis I didn't totally exclude consideration of such matters as companionship. I admit it was a factor that she had not yet given the slightest indication that she was aware that I was human.
But I rode alone, and as my cab pulled up in front of the old brownstone I was afraid there would be more delay. It was five minutes past four, and it was at least even money that Wolfe had gone up to the plant rooms. Three of them were standing at the foot of the stoop steps, and the other three were climbing out of their taxi. I paid the hackie and went and led the way up, and as I reached the top the door was opened by Saul Panzer. "Mr. Henchy to the office," he told me, "and the others to the front room."
Lawyers can be pests and often are. Eight people in the end of that hall disposing of coats are a crowd, and when I got Henchy separated and started him down the hall to the office, there somehow was Oster, moving like a man who intends to stay in charge. I thought, What the hell, it will be simpler to use the connecting door, and let him come; and sure enough, he went straight to the red leather chair, stood in front of it, and told Wolfe, "Whipple's not here to interfere this time. You'll listen to me."
Relieved that Wolfe was there and my errand was done, I sat down and got my notebook and pen. Let him do the reacting.

Oster made a noise, part snort and part snarl. He sat.
"That crap," he said. "The Great White Whosis. I'm a member of the bar, and what are you?"
Wolfe regarded him. "I really can't blame you. If I were a Negro I would have been locked up long ago - or I would be dead. You actually believe that your skin color and mine are factors in my treatment of you. Pfui. I'm not a troglodyte. Archie, the relevant portion of your telephone conversation with Mr. Vaughn yesterday afternoon."
==> I recited it for them as I had for Cramer, but slower and emphasizing "important," and adding at the end that he hadn't rung again. Henchy was frowning at me, concentrating. Oster was looking skeptical, but he was getting it. Wolfe spoke. <==
"Those were the last words, for us, from Mr. Vaughn. 'It's probably nothing.' But unfortunately for him it wasn't. It's a conclusion, more than an assumption, that he was going to see again someone he had seen earlier, or at least explore some suspicion resulting from an earlier contact. It's possible that that contact had not been at your office, but I know of none other he might have made relevant to the fate of Susan Brooke, and I doubt if the police do. It's also a conclusion, not lightly to be abandoned, that he was killed by the person who killed Miss Brooke. Do you reject that, Mr. Oster?"
"Reject it, no. If he said what Goodwin says he did."
"For me that is not moot. If it is for you, it will be a soliloquy. Are you willing to
tell me what Mr. Vaughn said to you yesterday, and what you said to him?" "He said nothing, and neither did I."
"He didn't see you?"

"I suppose so, of course. Have you - "
"The blue sedan?"
"Yes. Have you - "
"Sorry, I'm being interrupted." I hung up and turned. "As I said, just great. About

==>  an hour ago Mrs. Matthew Brooke took Mrs. Kenneth Brooke's car to go to meet someone who had phoned her that she could tell her something about Susan. She may still be alive. Of all the lousy breaks. Do I talk to Cramer or do you?" <==
"What for?"
"For God's sake! A stop-and-take on the goddam car!" "It isn't necessary. Saul."
"What do you mean, Saul? He can't - "
"He is covering Miss Jordan. As you know, he was told yesterday to inquire about her. He telephoned this morning shortly after you had reported from Evansville, and I told him to get Fred and Orrie and keep her under constant surveillance."
I returned to my pocket the key ring I had got out. Its collection included the key to the locked drawer from which I had been going to get the license number of the blue sedan. "Damn it, you might have told me."

And you realize that any dimwit can lose a tail, even if it's Saul Panzer. You'd like to deliver her wrapped up, sure, so would I. But it would be nearly as good and a lot safer to ring him now and say the woman who killed Susan Brooke and Peter Vaughn is now somewhere in your territory in a blue Heron sedan with Mrs. Matthew Brooke and is going to kill her. The car's number is here in the drawer." <==
He called me. He asked, merely wanting information, "Do you wish to do that?" "Of course I don't wish to!"
"Would Saul?"
"If he has lost her, yes. If he's still on her, no."
He turned a palm up. "Then it's simple. We determine our action or inaction by the extent of our confidence in Saul's craft and sagacity. Mine, though not

She passed her tongue over her lips. "I'm not going to talk about that." "And you had it again this evening, for Mrs. Brooke. The same gun?"
"Of course. It was my husband's. He always carried it when he brought money from the bank for the payroll. I don't want to talk about that, I want to talk about Susan. She called me Maud, you know, and I called her Susan. Of course my Richard had called her Susan, he told me all about her, but I had never met her. I have two pictures of her that he had, one with him. I'm not sure you understand how I felt about her. I'm not saying I loved her because my Richard had, that wasn't it exactly, but I wanted to be close to her, I wanted to see her every day.

 Do you understand that?"
"I think I do. It's somewhat involved." Wolfe's eyes moved. "The kitchen extension, Archie."
==> I pressed a button and got up and went. As I passed Saul he winked. I'm going to talk him out of that some day. In the kitchen I sat at my breakfast table, pulled the phone over, and dialed. Cramer doesn't like to be called at his home number, but if I had rung Homicide South I would probably have got Rowcliff, and I didn't want to take the time and trouble to get him stuttering. After four buzzes a female voice I knew said hello, and I said, 'This is Archie Goodwin, Mrs. Cramer. May I speak to the inspector, please?" <==
She said she'd see, and in a minute there was a growl in my ear, "What do you want, Goodwin?"
"I'm in the kitchen. Mr. Wolfe needs help. The woman who killed Susan Brooke and Peter Vaughn is in the office with him, talking a blue streak, and won't stop. She has explained why she killed Susan, and now she's explaining - "
"Damn you, are you clowning?"
"I am not. I'm sick and tired of being accused of clowning by cops. This morning in Evansville, Indiana, a police lieutenant did, and I brought him - "
"Who's the woman with Wolfe?"

"Posilutely. Not a chance."


"Wonderful. But the next time use an ambulance. You'll find a piece of my ear in the corner. Keep it to remember me by."
I got out. He asked if there was anything more, and I said no and I would thank him later, and he rolled.
==> The Westside Hotel, in the middle of the block, was not exactly a dump, though many people would call it that. Evidently it was still in the black, since it had put on a new front and redone the lobby a couple of years back. Entering and ignoring everybody and everything, including a bald bellhop, I went to the do-it- yourself elevator, pushed the button, and was lifted. As I emerged and went to the nearest door to look at the number I noticed that my hand had slipped inside my coat to touch the Marley, and grinned at myself. If it was J. Edgar Hoover waiting for me, apparently he had better behave or he might get plugged. At Room 214, halfway down the hall on the left, the door was closed. My watch said 11:33. I knocked, and heard footsteps, and the door opened; and I stood and gawked. I was looking at the round red face and burly figure of Inspector Cramer of Homicide South. <==
"Right on time," he growled. "Come in." He sidestepped, and I crossed the sill.
My eyes have been trained so long to notice things that they took in the room automatically - the double bed, dresser with a mirror, two chairs, table with a desk pad that needed changing, open door to a bathroom - while my mind adjusted to the shock. Then, as I put my coat and hat on the bed, I got another shock: one of the chairs, the one without arms, was near the table, and on the table was a carton of milk and a glass. By God, he had bought it and brought it for his guest. I don't blame you if you don't believe it. I didn't, but there it was.
He went to the other chair, the one with arms, sat, and asked, "Are you loose?"
"Sure. I always obey instructions."
"Sit down."

I went to the other chair. He leveled his gray eyes at me. "Is Wolfe's phone tapped?"
My eyes were meeting his. "Look," I said, "you know damn well how it is. If I

 had listed a hundred names of people who might be here, yours wouldn't have been on it. Is this carton of milk for me?"
"Yes."
==> "Then you're off your hinges. You are not the Inspector Cramer I know so well, and I don't know what I'm up against. Why do you want to know if our phone is tapped?" <==
"Because I don't like to make things more complicated than they are already. I like things simple. I'd like to know if I could just have called you and asked you to come here."
"Oh. Sure you could, but if you had I would have suggested that it might be better if we went for a ride."
He nodded. "All right. I want to know, Goodwin. I know Wolfe has tangled with the FBI, and I want the picture. All of it. If it takes all day."
I shook my head. "That's out of bounds and you know it."
He exploded. "Goddammit, "this" is out of bounds! My being here! My getting you here! I thought you had some sense! Don't you realize what I'm doing?"

"You left out a little detail, the caliber of the bullet."
"I didn't leave it out. There was no bullet. It wasn't there." My eyes widened. "Well. A damned neat murderer."
"Yeah. Neat and coolheaded. Judging from the wound, it was a thirty-eight or bigger. Now two facts. One: for three weeks Althaus had been collecting material for an article on the FBI for "Tick-Tock" magazine, and not a sign of it, nothing, was there in the apartment. Two: about eleven o'clock that Friday night three FBI men left the house at Sixty-three Arbor Street and went around the corner to a car and drove off."

sat and looked at him. There are various reasons for keeping your mouth shut, but the best one is that you have nothing to say.
==> "So they killed him," Cramer said. "Did they go there to kill him? Certainly not. There are several ways to figure it. The one I like best is that they rang his number and he wasn't answering the phone, so they thought he was out. They went and rang his bell and he wasn't answering that either, so they opened the door and went in for a bag job. He pulled a gun, and one of them shot before he did. They train them good in that basement in Washington. They looked for what they wanted and got it and left, taking the bullet because it was from one of their guns." <==
I was listening. I never listened better. I asked, "Did he have a gun?"
"Yes. S and W thirty-eight. He had a permit. It wasn't there. They took it, you'd have to ask them why. There was a box of cartridges, nearly full, in a drawer."
I sat and looked some more, then said, "So you "have" cracked it. Congratulations."
"You'd clown in the hot seat, Goodwin. Do I have to describe it?" "No. But, after all - Who saw them?"
He shook his head. "I'll give you everything but that. He couldn't help you anyway. He saw them leave the house and go to the car and drive off, and he got the license number. That's how we know and all we know. We're hogtied. Even if we could name them, where would that get us? I've seen plenty of murderers I could name, but so what, if I couldn't prove it. But this one, that goddam outfit, I'd give a year's pay to hook them and make it stick. This isn't their town, it's mine. Ours. The New York Police Department. They've had us gritting our teeth for years. Now, by God, they think they can break and enter people's houses and commit homicide in "my" territory, and laugh at me!"

But there was another reason for saving it. As we pushed our chairs back I told him I wanted to show him something in the basement, and I led the way to the hall, then to the right, and down the steps. The basement has Fritz's room and bath, a storeroom, and a large room with a pool table. In the last is not only the usual raised bench, but also a big comfortable chair on a platform, for Wolfe when he feels like watching Saul Panzer and me use our cues, which happens about once a year. I led him to that room, flipped the wall switch for light, and spoke.
"Your new office. I hope you like it. There may be only one chance in a million that they can bug a room without getting inside, but that's one too many. Be seated." I lifted my rump onto the rim of the pool table, facing the big chair.
He glared. "Are you badgering me or is it possible?"


==> "It's conceivable. I wouldn't risk leaking it that Inspector Cramer told me to give you his regards. Also that he bought me a carton of milk, shook my hand, and wished me a happy New Year." <==
"This is flummery."
"No, sir. It was Cramer."
"In that hotel room?"
"Yes."
He stepped onto the platform and sat. "Report," he growled.

"Yes."
He stepped onto the platform and sat. "Report," he growled.
I obeyed. I didn't rush it because I wanted to be sure to get every word in. If we had been in the office he would have leaned back and closed his eyes, but that chair wasn't built for it and he had to stay straight. For the last ten minutes his lips were pressed tight, either because of what he was hearing or of where he was sitting, probably both. I finished with my sightseeing trip and said that a man across the street, maybe walking a dog, or one in a front room of either of two houses, could have seen them leave Number 63 and go around the corner to the car, and even the license number. There was a light at the corner.
He took in a bushel of air through his nose and let it out through his mouth. "I wouldn't have thought," he said, "that Mr. Cramer could be such an ass."

He only knew we had stung them somehow, and he had a murder he couldn't tag them for, and he decided to hand it to you. You've got to admit that you should feel flattered that he thought there was the remotest chance you could pull it, and look at all the trouble he took. And after I told him about Mrs. Bruner he didn't stop to figure it. Probably he has by now. He must realize that it doesn't fit. Suppose you passed a miracle and tied that murder to them so they couldn't shake it off. That wouldn't fill your client's order. The only way that could help her and earn you a fee would be if you said to them, look, I'll lay off on the murder if you'll lay off of Mrs. Bruner. Cramer wouldn't like that, that's not his idea at all. Neither would you, really. Making a deal with a murderer isn't your style. Have I got it straight?"
He grunted. "I don't like your pronouns.


"All right, make it 'we' and 'us.' It's not my style either."

He shook his head. "It's a pickle." A corner of his mouth curled up. I stared and demanded, "What the hell are you smiling at?"
"The pickle. The alternative. You have made it clear that it would be futile to establish that the FBI killed that man. Very well, then we'll establish that they didn't."
"Good for us. And then?"
==> "We'll see." He turned a hand over. "Archie. We had nothing. The items Mr. Cohen gave us were mere trivia, offering not even a forlorn hope. Now, thanks to Mr. Cramer, we have a nut with meat in it, an unsolved murder in which the FBI is deeply involved, whether they committed it or not. An open challenge to ingenuity, to our talents if we have any. We need first to learn, assuredly, who killed that man. You saw Mr. Cramer's face and heard his tone. Is he really satisfied that it was the FBI?" <==
"Yes." "Justly?"
"He thinks so. Of course it appeals to him. He refers to them as that goddam outfit and that bunch of grabbers. After he learned about the three G-men being at the scene at the right time he probably let up on other possibilities, but he's a good cop, and if there had been any other lead that was at all hot he would have kept on it, and apparently he didn't. Also, if Althaus was there dead when they entered, why didn't they report it? Anonymously, of course, after they left. They might have preferred not to, but it's a fair question. Also the bullet. Not many murderers would have realized that it had gone on through to the wall and fallen to the floor, and found it and taken it. With an old pro like Cramer that would be a big point. So I guess you could say justly."
He was frowning at me. "Who is the Wragg Mr. Cramer mentioned?" "Richard Wragg. Top G-man in New York. Special agent in charge."

Does he know, or believe, that Althaus was killed by one of his men?"

She said yes, and I went. In the foyer the maid came and wanted to hold my coat, and not to hurt her feelings I let her. Down in the lobby, from the look the doorman gave me as he opened the door I deduced that the hallman had told him what I was, and to be in character I met the look with a sharp and wary eye. Outside, some snowflakes were doing stunts. In the taxi, headed downtown, again I ignored the rear. I figured that if they were on me, which was highly likely, maybe one cent of each ten grand of Wolfe's income tax, and one mill of each ten grand of mine, would go to pay government employees to keep me company uninvited, which didn't seem right.

 had just come down from the plant rooms after his four-to-six afternoon session with the orchids and got nicely settled in his chair with "The Treasure of Our Tongue". Instead of going on in and crossing to my desk as usual, I stopped at the sill of the office door, and when he looked up I pointed a finger straight down, emphatically, turned, and beat it to the stairs to the basement and on down. Flipping the light switch, I went and perched on the pool table. Two minutes. Three. Four, and there were footsteps. He stood at the door, glared at me, and spoke.
"I won't tolerate this."
I raised an eyebrow. "I could write it."
==> "Pfui. Two points. One, the risk is extremely slight. Two, we can use it. As you talk you can insert comments or statements at will which I am to disregard, notifying me by raising a finger. I shall do the same. Of course making no reference to Mr. Cramer; we can't risk that; and maintaining our conclusion that the FBI killed that man, and we intend to establish it." <==
"But actually we don't."
"Certainly not." He turned and went.
So I was foxed. His house, his office, and his chair. But I had to admit, as I mounted the steps, that pigheaded as he was, it wasn't a bad idea. If they really had an electronic ear on the office, which I didn't believe, it might even be a damned good idea. When I entered the office he was back at his desk and I went to mine, and as I sat he said, "Well?"
He should have had a finger raised. He never wastes breath by saying "Well?" when I return from an errand; he merely puts the book down, or the beer glass, and is ready for me to speak.
I raised a finger. "Your guess that they might have hit on the FBI theory at the "Gazette", and be working on it, wasn't so good." I lowered the finger. "Lon Cohen didn't mention it, so I didn't. They haven't got a theory. He let me go through the files, and we talked, and I got a dozen pages of names and assorted details, some of which might possibly be useful." I raised a finger. "I'll type it up at the usual five dollars a page." I lowered the finger. "Next I phoned Mrs. David Althaus from a booth, and she said she would see me, and I went. Park Avenue in the Eighties, tenth-floor apartment, all the trimmings you would expect.

"She did, after she saw the three men leaving, but the door was locked and she had no key, and her knock or ring wasn't answered. Anyway, I am only answering your question does she lie. She does."
"Then we need the truth. Get it."
That was par. He does not believe that I can take a girl to the Flamingo and dance a couple of hours and end up with all her deepest secrets, but he pretends he does because he thinks it makes me try harder.
"I'll consider it," I said. "I'll sleep on it - on the couch. May I change the subject? Last night you asked me if I could contrive any maneuver that would help to make Wragg believe that one of his men killed Althaus, and I said I couldn't. But I have. They have an open tail on Sarah Dacos, so they know she was here, and almost certainly they know you are. Also they know she lives at Sixty-three Arbor Street, and they do not know what she saw or heard that night. Therefore they don't know what she might have told you here tonight, but they'll assume it was something about "that" night. That should help."
"Possibly. Satisfactory."
==> "Yeah. But. If we take a taxi, now, to Cramer's home and spend an hour with him, they will absolutely assume that we have got something hot regarding his unsolved homicide, and that we got it from Sarah Dacos. That "would" help." <==
He shook his head. "You gave Mr. Cramer our word of honor."
"Only about his seeing me and telling me. We go to him because in trying to dig up something on the FBI we got interested in Morris Althaus because he was working on them, and he was murdered, and Sarah Dacos tells us something about the murder that we think Cramer should know. Our word of honor is good as gold."
"What time is it?"
I looked. "Three minutes to ten."

At 10:35 Saturday morning I used a key on the door of 63 Arbor Street, ascended two flights of wooden stairs, used another key, and entered the apartment that had been Morris Althaus's.
I was following my own approach to the problem of getting it out of Sarah Dacos. I admit it was roundabout, especially in view of the fact that time was short, but it was a better stab at getting results than persuading her to go to the Flamingo for an evening of dancing. The fact that time was short had been made publicly evident by an item on the twenty-eighth page of the morning paper, which I had read at my breakfast table in the kitchen. It was headlined FINGERS CROSSED? and said:

The members of the Ten for Aristology, one of the most exclusive of New York's gourmet groups, evidently do not believe that history repeats itself.

That arrangement arouses memory of another occasion when Mr. Brenner cooked a dinner for the Ten for Aristology, and Mr. Wolfe and Mr. Goodwin were guests, at the home of Benjamin Schriver, the shipping magnate. It occurred on April 1, 1958, and one of the Ten, Vincent Pyle, head of a Wall Street brokerage firm, was poisoned with arsenic in his portion of the first course, served to him by Carol Annis, who was subsequently convicted of first- degree murder.

His eyes narrowed at me. "How the deuce do you know that? You don't read Keats."
I shrugged. "Back in Ohio in my boyhood days. As you know, I have quite a memory. I don't brag about that, but I have a brag coming about this." I tapped the photograph. "We know why she lied. She's involved. Possibly not too deep; it could be that she merely didn't want to admit she was close with him, close enough for him to tell her about the FBI. Or possibly "very" deep. 'Ever, ever shalt thou kiss.' And 'Forever wilt thou love.' But he told her he was going to marry another girl, so she shot him, probably with his own gun. The second alternative, which we prefer by far. It would be hard to nail her. She might be

 able to prove she was at that lecture but not what time she left. Possibly she wasn't there at all. She spent the evening at Sixty-three Arbor Street, having it out with the bold lover, and she shot him before the G-men arrived. Does that appeal to you?"
"As conjecture, yes."
==> "Then I should look into the lecture question. She might have a tight alibi. According to Cramer, the G-men left about eleven o'clock, and of course they had combed the place, whether they killed him or not; they got the material he had gathered. So they arrived not later than ten-thirty, or even make it ten-forty. If she shot him she was out before they came. The New School is on Twelfth Street. If anyone saw her at the lecture as late as ten-twenty, or even a quarter past, she's clear. I'll start asking." <==
"No." "No?"
"No. If they learned you were doing that, either by surveillance of you or through inadvertence, they would know we were seriously considering the possibility that that woman killed him, and that would be disastrous. We must maintain the illusion that we are convinced that a member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation killed Morris Althaus and that we are procuring evidence to establish it; otherwise our preparations for next Thursday evening will come to nothing. For protection of our flank we needed to know definitely if Miss Dacos was lying, and you have settled that: she was. Satisfactory. She lied to conceal the fact that she had compromised herself, and that satisfies us. Whether her involvement was merely a secret intimacy she doesn't want revealed, or was murder by her hand, is of no importance to us."
"Cramer would love to know that. After giving us the steer. I'll call him and tell him, to relieve his mind."
"Pfui. When we have relieved "our" minds by finishing the job we were hired to do we'll consider our obligation to him. If it seems feasible without excessive effort we'll expose the murderer for him. If it isn't a member of the FBI, as he expects and hopes, he won't thank us, but we'll owe him no apology."
"Then we forget the murder until after Thursday."

Yes."
"That's just dandy. Agencies are closed today and tomorrow, so Hewitt can't start looking until Monday. I'll be at the Flamingo this evening if anything happens; for instance, if Hewitt calls to say he has decided that it's too much trouble and we have to find someone else. Tomorrow Miss Rowan is having a crowd in for Sunday lunch and dancing and I'll stay afterwards to help empty ashtrays. Any instructions for this afternoon?"

It bothered me for four days and four nights, from Saturday afternoon, when Wolfe said we would forget the murder, to Wednesday morning, when I did something about it on my own.
==> There were two aspects. First, if the conjecture about Sarah Dacos, or something like it, was actually a fact, I had removed evidence from the scene of a murder and was withholding it. Of course the cops had had their whack at it, they had certainly seen the photograph and had left it there, and Mrs. Althaus had given me the keys, but that was only a legal out. It was the second aspect that really bothered me. Cramer had saved our licenses for us, at least so far, and it was me, Archie Goodwin, he had invited to a conference and bought a carton of milk for and turned loose on a homicide. I have no objection to playing games with cops, sometimes you want to and sometimes you have to, but this was different. I owed Cramer something personally. <==
So it bothered me, but something else was bothering me still more, the act Wolfe was staging, the fanciest on record. Too much of it, nearly all of it, was entirely out of our control. For instance, when I called Hewitt from a booth Monday evening to ask how he had made out, and he said fine, he had got one actor at one agency and the other at another, and they would both come to his place Tuesday afternoon, and I asked if he had made sure that the one for me could drive a car and had a license, he said he had forgotten to ask, but everyone could drive a car! And that was absolutely vital and he knew it. He said he would find out right away; he had the actor's phone number. On some other details he was okay, like his phone call to our number Tuesday noon, as arranged. He told Wolfe he was extremely sorry, he apologized, but he would be able to include only twelve "Phalaenopsis Aphrodite" in the shipment instead of twenty, and no

 "Oncidium flexuosum" at all. He said he would do his best to get it off by noon Wednesday, so it should arrive by two o'clock. He handled that perfectly. He was also okay on the call he made Tuesday evening, to report on the supplies and arrangements for the dinner for the Ten for Aristology, but for him that was just routine, and anyway it was straight.
Fred Durkin and Orrie Cather were no worry because they had been left to Saul to handle, and if there was any snag he would let us know. How was up to him.
Off and on all day and evening Monday, and even some on Tuesday, Wolfe and I discussed a problem. It wasn't an argument; we just discussed it. Should I phone Wragg, the special agent in charge, arrange to meet him somewhere, tell him that Wolfe had got enough dope on the Althaus homicide to make it really tough and I wanted out, and offer to pass everything we had over to him for ten grand or twenty grand or fifty grand? The trouble was we didn't know him. It might make it next to certain that he would take the bait, but it might do just the opposite, make him smell a rat. Finally, late Tuesday morning, we crossed it off. It was too chancy, and time was too short.

She said it depended on how late, Mrs. Bruner expected to be in the office from three-thirty to five-thirty, and I said I would call again if I needed to come.
So she was at her job. I would have to take a chance on the cleaning woman. I went to the kitchen to tell Fritz I was going out to make some phone calls, to the hall for my hat and coat, and out and to Ninth Avenue for a taxi.
For the street door at 63 Arbor Street I still had the key Mrs. Althaus had given me, so I was clean until I stood at Sarah Dacos's door and got out the collection of keys. When I had knocked twice, and pushed the button twice and heard the ring, with no response, I tried a key. The fourth one did it, smooth and easy. I put the gloves on, turned the knob, opened the door, crossed the sill, and shut the door, and I had broken and entered according to the statutes of the State of New York.
The layout was the same as upstairs, but the furniture was quite different. Rugs here and there instead of carpet, smaller couch smothered with pillows, no desk or typewriter, fewer chairs, about one-fourth as many books, five little pictures on the walls which the bold lover must have considered old hat. The drapes were drawn, and I turned the lights on, put my coat and hat on the couch, and went and opened a closet door.
==> There were two facts: the cleaning woman might come any minute, and I had no idea what I might find, if anything. The point was simply that there might be something that would help, no matter what was going to happen Thursday night, to square it with Cramer for that carton of milk. A fast once-over was called for, and I spent only ten minutes on the living room and its two closets and then went to the bedroom. <==
I came mighty close to passing it by. The bedroom closet was crammed - clothes on hangers, shoe racks, luggage, cartons and hatboxes on two high shelves. The bag and two suitcases were packed with summer clothes, and I skipped the hatboxes; I would have given a finif of "my" money to know if the cleaning woman came Wednesdays. But ten minutes later, going through a drawerful of photographs one by one, I realized that it was dumb to skip the hatboxes and then waste time with a bunch of photographs which could tell me nothing I didn't already know, so I took a chair to the closet, mounted it, and got the boxes down. There were three. The first one contained three so-called hats and two bikinis. The second one held one big floppy hat. I lifted it out, and there on the bottom was a revolver. I gawked at it for five seconds, then took it out and inspected it.

 It was an S &amp; W.38 and held one cartridge that had been fired and five that hadn't.
I stood with it in my hand. It was a hundred to one that it was the gun that Althaus had had a permit for, and it had fired the bullet that had gone through him, and Sarah Dacos had pulled the trigger. To hell with the one chance in a hundred. The question was what to do with it. If I took it, it would never be an acceptable exhibit in a murder trial, since I had got it illegally. If I left it there and went out to a phone booth and rang Cramer to tell him to get a warrant to search Sarah Dacos's apartment, the cops would get the gun all right, but if the FBI found out about it within thirty-six hours, as they easily might, the big act for Thursday night would be kaput. And of course if I left it in the hatbox and "didn't" phone Cramer, Sarah Dacos might decide that tonight would be a good time to take it and toss it in the river.
Since that left only one alternative, the only decision that had to be made was where to put it. I returned the hat to the box and the boxes to the shelf, put the chair back where it belonged, and looked around. No spot in the bedroom appealed to me, and I moved to the living room. It was now more than ever desirable not to be interrupted by a cleaning woman or anyone else. I went and examined the couch and found that underneath the cushion was a box spring, and underneath the spring was a plywood bottom. Good enough. If she got the hatbox down and found the gun gone, she certainly wouldn't suppose it had merely been moved to another spot in the apartment and start looking. I put it on the bottom under the spring, glanced around to see that things were as I had found them, grabbed my hat and coat, and got out of there in such a hurry that I almost appeared on the sidewalk wearing rubber gloves.

In the taxi I had to answer another question: did I or didn't I tell Wolfe? Why not wait until Thursday night had come and gone? The answer was really simple, but of course that's one thing we use our minds for, finding complicated reasons for dodging simple answers. By the time the cab stopped in front of the old brownstone my mind had run out of reasons and I was facing the fact that it wouldn't improve with age.
It was ten minutes past eleven, so Wolfe would be down from the plant rooms, but he wasn't in the office. There was noise in the kitchen, the radio going loud, and I went there. Wolfe was standing by the big table scowling at Fritz, who was bending over to sniff at a slab of smoked sturgeon. They didn't hear me enter, but Fritz saw me when he straightened up, and Wolfe turned and demanded,

In the taxi I had to answer another question: did I or didn't I tell Wolfe? Why not wait until Thursday night had come and gone? The answer was really simple, but of course that's one thing we use our minds for, finding complicated reasons for dodging simple answers. By the time the cab stopped in front of the old brownstone my mind had run out of reasons and I was facing the fact that it wouldn't improve with age.
It was ten minutes past eleven, so Wolfe would be down from the plant rooms, but he wasn't in the office. There was noise in the kitchen, the radio going loud, and I went there. Wolfe was standing by the big table scowling at Fritz, who was bending over to sniff at a slab of smoked sturgeon. They didn't hear me enter, but Fritz saw me when he straightened up, and Wolfe turned and demanded,

 "Where have you been?"
I told him I had a report. He told Fritz to have the cutlets ready at a quarter past two, he wasn't going to wait longer than that, and headed for the office, and I followed. I turned the radio on. As I brought a yellow chair around I saw three screwdrivers on his desk pad - one from my desk drawer and two from the kitchen, and I had to grin. He had the tools ready, himself. As I sat I told him I had assumed that he would eat an early lunch. He said no, if a man has guests he should be at table with them.
==> "Then there's plenty of time," I said, "to discuss a brief report. With so much on your mind I could save it, but you'll like to know that I have clinched the alternative we prefer. I went for a walk and happened to pass Sixty-three Arbor Street, and I happened to have a key in my pocket that fitted the lock on Sarah Dacos's door, so I went in and looked around, and in a hatbox in a closet I found a revolver, an S and W thirty-eight. One cartridge had been fired. As you know, Cramer told me that Althaus had a permit for an S and W thirty-eight and it wasn't in his apartment, though there was a box of cartridges in a drawer. So she -" <==
"What did you do with it?"
"I moved it. It seemed out of place in a box with a lady's hat, so I put it under a box spring on a couch."
He took a deep breath, held it in a second, and let it out. "She shot him," he growled.
"Right. As I was saying when you interrupted." "Will she find it?"
"No. If she misses it she won't even look. My understanding of attractive young women. She might lam. If she does I'll have a problem. If she's gone and I tell Cramer about the gun I'll be up a tree. If I don't tell him I'll lie awake nights."

He shut his eyes. In two moments he opened them. "You should have told me you were going."
"I should not. It was a personal errand in which a quart of milk was involved.

 Even if she stays put I'll have a problem, if tomorrow night is a turkey. If and if. Just now I wanted to ring Hewitt from a booth and ask him if the orchids are packed. Shall I?"
"No. He's busy. I believe guns can be identified?"

"No. He's busy. I believe guns can be identified?"
==> "Sure. Scientists can do it now even if the number has been filed off. And Cramer will have the number of the one Althaus had a permit for." <==
"Then there will be no problem. I must see about that sturgeon." He left his chair and headed for the door. Short of it he stopped and turned, said, "Satisfactory," and went. I shook my head and went on shaking it as I replaced the yellow chair. "There will be no problem," for God's sake. I thought if I had an ego that size I'd be the boss of the FBI, and then realized that that wasn't exactly the way to put it. I returned the keys and gloves to the cabinet, went to the kitchen to get a glass of milk, since lunch would be late, and to listen to them discuss sturgeon.
With a couple of hours to go, possibly more, after the milk was down I made the rounds - first two flights up to my room, to see that everything was in order for the guests who would occupy my bed. Fritz isn't supposed to touch my room; it's mine, including the responsibility. It was okay, except that the two pillows I had got from the closet that morning weren't the same size, but that couldn't be helped. Then to the South Room, which is above Wolfe's, where two more guests would sleep on the twin beds. That visit was unnecessary, since Fritz never makes mistakes, but I had time to kill.
It got killed somehow.
I wasn't expecting them until two at the earliest, but I should have known better, since Saul was in charge. Wolfe was in the kitchen and I was in the front room, which adjoins the office, checking that blankets were on the sofa, when the doorbell rang and I glanced at my watch. Twenty to two, so it couldn't be the truck.
But it was. Going to the hall, I saw a big bozo in a leather jacket on the stoop. When I opened the door he boomed at me, "Nero Wolfe? Orchids for you!"

 evidence that they, one of them, had hilled him. Talk sense."
"You still haven't told me why you were investigating a homicide."
"Isn't that obvious? Because I had learned that your men had been there." "How did you learn that?"
Wolfe shook his head. "That's reserved."
==> "Have you been in touch with Inspector Cramer?" <==
"No. I haven't seen or spoken with him for months."
"Or the District Attorney's office?"
"No."
"Are you going to continue the investigation?"
A corner of Wolfe's mouth went up. "You know, Mr. Wragg, I am both able and willing to relieve your mind, but first I must be assured that I have done my job. Have you accepted my offer? Do you assure me that from six o'clock this afternoon there will be no surveillance of any kind by your bureau of Mrs. Bruner or anyone connected with her?"

Saul has not yet heard the last of that. It didn't change my decision about marriage because I prefer to do the courting myself, but it gave me one on Saul. Wolfe told her no, Mr. Goodwin had work to do, and the poor woman had to settle for Saul. He brought her coat from the front room and held it for her, and I admit I had a pang. By the time they got to Seventy-fourth Street she would be appreciating him. Not wanting to intrude, I didn't go to the hall with them.
When the sound came of the front door closing Wolfe cocked his head at me and demanded, "Say something."
"Bejabers," I said. "Will that do? A guy I know named Bimbaum uses it to show he's not prejudiced. Bejabers."
"Satisfactory."
"All of that."
==> "Our telephone is still tapped. Will you see Mr. Cramer before lunch?" <==
"After would be better. He'll be in a better humor. It will take them only an hour or so to get the warrant."
"Very well But don't - Yes, Fred?"
Fred Durkin, at the door, announced, "They want breakfast."

==>  wear, Cramer's desk would appreciate a sanding job, I have never seen the windows really clean, and the chairs, all but Cramer's, are plain, honest, hard wood. As I put my fundament on one of them at 2:35 p.m. he snapped at me, "I told you don't come and don't phone." <==
I nodded. "But it's okay now and I had to. Mr. Wolfe - " "What's okay?"
"He has earned the hundred grand "and" a fee."
"The hell he has. He has got them to quit on that Mrs. Bruner?" "Yes. Bejabers. But we haven't filled your order. We have - " "I didn't give any order."
"Oh, all right. We have learned that it wasn't a G-man who shot Morris Althaus. We think we know who did, and we think we know how it can be tagged. I'm not going to tell you how we put the screws on the FBI. That's not what I came for, and Mr. Wolfe will enjoy telling you some time at your leisure, and you'll enjoy listening. It was the longest shot he has ever played, and it hit. I'm here to talk homicide."
"Go ahead. Talk."

"Not unless I'm put under arrest." I got sore. "What more do you want, for God's sake? You've had this homicide nearly two months! We've had it one week!"
I turned and walked out. It was even money I would be stopped, if not there by him then down on the ground floor when I left the elevator. But all I got, from the bull on duty in the downstairs hall, who knew me by sight, was a nod, not too friendly but almost human. I didn't loiter.
I crossed town to Sixth Avenue and turned south. Everything was under control at the old brownstone. Ashley Jarvis and Dale Kirby, not too badly hung over, had been fed a hearty breakfast and handed the bonus of one grand each, and had departed. Fred and Orrie had each been given three Cs for two days' work, not to mention nights, miles above scale, and had also departed. Saul was up at Mrs. Bruner's office getting ready to paint or plaster, whichever suited. Wolfe would of course be reading a book, certainly not "The FBI Nobody Knows", since he knew them now, anyhow three of them, and at four o'clock he would go up to the plant rooms, back on schedule. Since I never take an afternoon nap, even when I'm short on sleep, I could go for a walk, and did.
I came to a stop across the street from 63 Arbor Street. But the thermometer outside the front-room window had said sixteen above zero when I got up, and it had climbed only about five notches since, and I had the keys in my pocket, so I crossed the street, entered, and mounted the two flights to Althaus's apartment. I include this in the report not because it changed anything, but because I

==>  remember so well my state of mind. Fifty-three hours had passed since I had put the gun under the box spring, and that was time enough for a healthy girl to find a dozen guns and put them somewhere else. If it wasn't there we would now be out on a limb, and a shaky one, since I had told Cramer. He knew Wolfe hadn't sent me there just on a suspicion or a hunch; he knew we knew there was something hot in that apartment, and if it was gone we were in for it. If I told him about the gun I would be admitting I had tampered with evidence; if I didn't, I would be suspected of something even worse, and good-by licenses. <==
You may not be interested in my state of mind, but believe me I was. At one of the front windows in Althaus's living room I pushed the drape aside and pressed my forehead against the glass so I could see the sidewalk below. That was fairly dumb, but a state of mind cars make you dumb. It was 3:25. I had left Cramer only thirty-five minutes ago, and it would take them about an hour to get the warrant, so what was I expecting to see? Also the glass was cold, and I backed away a couple of inches. But I was really on edge, and now and then I put my forehead to the glass again, and after a while I did see something. Sarah Dacos came in view on the sidewalk with a big brown paper bag under her arm and turned in at the entrance. It was ten minutes to four. Seeing her didn't help my state of mind any. I had nothing against Sarah Dacos. Of course I had nothing for her either. A woman who sends a bullet through a man's pump may or may not deserve some sympathy, but she damn well can't expect a stranger to take a detour if she gets in his way while he's doing a job.
Bending my ears, I heard the door of her apartment open and close.
At a quarter past four two police cars stopped out in front. One of them found a spot at the curb and the other one double-parked, and I recognized all three of the homicide dicks who got out and headed for Number 63. One of them, Sergeant Purley Stebbins, was probably thinking of me as he pushed the button at the door. He hates to find Nero Wolfe or me in the same county with a homicide, and here he was on an errand we were responsible for. I wanted to go to the hall to hear the conversation when he showed her the warrant, but didn't. He might smell me and it would hold up the search.
It took them not more than ten minutes to find it. They entered the apartment at 4:21, that was when I heard the door close, and Purley left the house with her at 4:43. I'm allowing twelve minutes for him to ask her a few questions after he got the gun. I stood at the window and watched Purley get in the car with her, and

 the car pull off, and then went and sat on the couch. Since he had taken her, the question about the gun was answered. I stayed on the couch a few minutes while my state of mind got adjusted.

He said certainly, and I helped myself.
I was at my desk, making out checks to pay bills, when Wolfe came down from the plant rooms. Though he hadn't said so I knew he was as much on edge as I

 had been, and as he went to his desk I turned my head and said, "Relax. They got the gun."
"How do you know?"
==> I told him, beginning with the conversation with Cramer and ending with the conversation with Fritz. He asked if I had got a receipt for the photograph. <==
"No," I said, "he wasn't in a mood for signing receipts. I had told him that Althaus hadn't been killed by a G-man, and that hurt."
"No doubt. Will Mr. Wragg be at his office?" "He could be."
"Get him."
I turned and got the phone, but as I started to dial the doorbell rang. I cradled it and went to the hall for a look, turned, and said, "You can ask him for the receipt."
He took a breath. "Is he alone?"

He took a breath. "Is he alone?"
==> I told him yes and went to the front and opened the door. Cramer didn't have a carton of milk for me. He had nothing at all for me, not even a nod. When I had his coat he made for the office, and when I got there he was planted in the red leather chair and talking. I got the end of it: "...and I might have known better. God knows I "should" know better." He switched to me as I sat. "Where did you get that gun and when did you put it there?" <==
"Confound it," Wolfe growled, "you shouldn't have come. You should have waited until you had arranged your mind. Archie, get Mr. Wragg."
When Cramer is boiling it isn't easy to stop the steam, but that did, the name Wragg. I didn't see him clamp his jaw and glare at Wolfe, I only knew he did, because my back was turned as I dialed LE5-7700. I was supposing it would take patience and staying power to get through to the top, but not at all. Apparently word had been passed down that a call from Nero Wolfe had priority, which was a good sign. In no time the smooth low-pitched drawl was in my ear, and in Wolfe's too, for he had picked up his phone. I stayed on.

"Wolfe?"
"Yes. Mr. Wragg?" "Yes."

"Yes. Mr. Wragg?" "Yes."
"I'm ready for that bullet. Now. As we agreed. Bring the bullet, and I surrender the credentials if you are not satisfied within a month. I think it will be sooner, much sooner.

"Wragg of the FBI?"
"Yes. I suggest that you postpone your onslaught until he arrives - and, perhaps, goes - and meanwhile I'll describe an operation which has been concluded. I have told Mr. Wragg that I will make no public disclosure of it, but you are not the public, and since you made it possible I owe it to you. But it will help in dealing with him if you will answer two questions. Was a gun found in Miss Dacos's apartment?"
"Certainly. I just asked Goodwin when he put it there, and I'm going to ask him again."
"You may not after we finish with Mr. Wragg. Was it the gun Morris Althaus had a permit for?"
"Yes."

When he came to the scene in the office, with the two G-men completely surrounded by guns and him dropping their credentials in his drawer, I saw something I had never seen before and will probably never see again, a broad smile on the face of Inspector Cramer. And it was there again when, reporting the conversation with Wragg that morning, Wolfe came to where he had told him that his word was much better. I was thinking that he might even pop up to go to Wolfe and pat him on the back when the doorbell rang and I went to answer it. <==
I have mentioned that Wragg was fazed when Wolfe asked him to bring the bullet, but that was nothing compared to the jolt he got when he walked into the office and saw Cramer. I was behind him and couldn't see his face, but I saw him go stiff and his fingers curl. Cramer, on his feet, started a hand out but took it back.
As I brought a yellow chair Wragg spoke to Wolfe. "Your word? Better than mine? You goddam skunk!"
"Sit down," Wolfe said. "Whether my word is better or not, my brain is. I don't judge a situation before I understand it. Mr. Cramer is - "
"All agreements are off."
"Pfui. You're not a donkey. Mr. Cramer is regretting that he surmised that a member of your bureau was a murderer. If you sit down and compose yourself he may tell you so."

 about it, and he gave all the details. When he came to the scene in the office, with the two G-men completely surrounded by guns and him dropping their credentials in his drawer, I saw something I had never seen before and will probably never see again, a broad smile on the face of Inspector Cramer. And it was there again when, reporting the conversation with Wragg that morning, Wolfe came to where he had told him that his word was much better. I was thinking that he might even pop up to go to Wolfe and pat him on the back when the doorbell rang and I went to answer it.
I have mentioned that Wragg was fazed when Wolfe asked him to bring the bullet, but that was nothing compared to the jolt he got when he walked into the office and saw Cramer. I was behind him and couldn't see his face, but I saw him go stiff and his fingers curl. Cramer, on his feet, started a hand out but took it back.
As I brought a yellow chair Wragg spoke to Wolfe. "Your word? Better than mine? You goddam skunk!"
==> "Sit down," Wolfe said. "Whether my word is better or not, my brain is. I don't judge a situation before I understand it. Mr. Cramer is - " <==
"All agreements are off."
"Pfui. You're not a donkey. Mr. Cramer is regretting that he surmised that a member of your bureau was a murderer. If you sit down and compose yourself he may tell you so."
"I have no apologies for anybody," Cramer growled. He turned his head to make sure the red leather chair was still there, and sat. "Anyone who withholds information - "
"No," Wolfe snapped. "If you gentlemen must contend, that's your affair, but not in my office. I want to resolve a situation, not tangle it. I like eyes at a level, Mr. Wragg. Be seated."
"Resolve it how?"

Wolfe turned a palm up. "Actually," he said, "the situation isn't tangled at all. We all want the same thing. I want to get rid of an obligation. You, Mr. Wragg, want it made manifest that your men are not criminally implicated in a murder. You, Mr. Cramer, want to identify and bring to account the person who killed Morris Althaus. It couldn't be simpler. You, Mr. Wragg, give Mr. Cramer the bullet you have in your pocket and tell him where it came from. You, Mr. Cramer, have a comparison made of that bullet with one fired from the gun which was taken this afternoon from the apartment of Sarah Dacos, and along with other evidence which no doubt your men are securing now, that will settle it.

"I haven't said I have a bullet in my pocket."

Under the statutes of the State of New York he may legally search you, here and now, and get it. Is that correct, Mr. Cramer?"

Wragg's hand went to a pocket and came out with a little plastic vial. He rose and took a step.

Three evenings later, Monday around half past six, Wolfe and I were in the office, debating a point about the itemization of expenses to go with the bill to Mrs. Bruner. I admit it was a minor point, but it was a matter of principle. He was maintaining that it was just and proper to include the lunch at Rusterman's, on the ground that the meals we got there were in consideration of services he had rendered and was still rendering to the restaurant and so were not actually gratis. My position was that the past services had already been rendered, and the present ones would be rendered, even if she and I had gone to the Automat for lunch.
"I realize," I said, "that you're up against it. Even if you push the fee to the limit, say another hundred grand, it still might not be enough to last the whole year, and around Labor Day, or at least Thanksgiving, you might have to take on a job, so you need to squeeze out every nickel you can. But she has been a marvelous client, and you should have some consideration for her, and indirectly for me too in case I decide to marry her. She has a lot of other expenses besides you, and now she'll have another one, now that she's going to supply a high- priced lawyer to defend Sarah Dacos. Have a heart."

"It’s mine. You’ve served it."
"I have not. I just showed it to you." He stretched an arm and took it. "When I was here Tuesday night," he told Wolfe, "you were dumfounded by my fatuity. So you said in your fancy way. All you cared about was who picked that corn. I came myself to see how you feel now. Goodwin will talk if you tell him to. Do you want me to wait in the front room while you discuss it? Not all day, say ten minutes. I’m giving you a - "
He stopped to glare. Wolfe had pushed his chair back and was rising, and of course Cramer thought he was walking out. It wouldn’t have been the first time. But Wolfe headed for the safe, not the hall. As he turned the handle and pulled the door open, there I was. If he had told me to bring it instead of going for it himself, I could have stalled while I made up my mind, even with Cramer there, but as I have said twice before I never did actually make up my mind. I merely went to my desk and sat. I owed Sue McLeod nothing. If either she or I was going to be cooped, there were two good reasons why it should be her: she had

 made the soup herself, and I wouldn’t be much help in the joint affair if I was salted down. So I sat, and Wolfe got it from the safe, went and handed it to Cramer, and spoke. "I suggest that you look at the affidavits first. The last two sheets."
==> Over the years I have made a large assortment of cracks about Inspector Cramer, but I admit he has his points. Having inspected the affidavits, he went through the twelve pages fast, and then he went back and started over and took his time. Altogether, more than half an hour; and not once did he ask a question or even look up. And when he finished, even then no questions. Lieutenant Rowcliff or Sergeant Purley Stebbins would have kept at us for an hour. Cramer merely gave each of us a five-second straight hard look, folded the document and put it in his inside breast pocket, rose and came to my desk, picked up the phone, and dialed. In a moment he spoke. <==
"Donovan? Inspector Cramer. Give me Sergeant Stebbins." In another moment: "Purley? Get Susan McLeod. Don’t call her, get her. Go yourself. I’ll be there in ten minutes and I want her there fast. Take a man along. If she balks, wrap her up and carry her."
He cradled the phone, went to the stand and got his hat, and marched out.

OF ALL THE THOUSAND or more times I have felt like putting vinegar in Wolfe’s beer, I believe the closest I ever came to doing it was that Thursday evening when the doorbell rang at a quarter past nine, and after a look at the front I told him that Carl Heydt, Max Maslow, and Peter Jay were on the stoop, and he said they were not to be admitted.
In the nine and a half hours that had passed since Cramer had used my phone to call Purley Stebbins I had let it lie. I couldn’t expect Wolfe to start any fur flying until there was a reaction, or there wasn’t, say by tomorrow noon, to what had happened to Sue. However, I had made a move on my own. When Wolfe had left the office at four o’clock to go up to the plant rooms, I had told him I would be out on an errand for an hour or so, and I had taken a walk, to Rusterman’s, thinking I might pick up some little hint.

I didn’t. First I went out back for a look at the platform and the alley, which might seem screwy, since two days and nights had passed and the city scientists

 had combed it, but you never know. I once got an idea just running my eye around a hotel room where a woman had spent a night six months earlier. But I got nothing from the platform or alley except a scraped ear from squeezing under the platform and out again, and after talking with Felix and Joe and some of the kitchen staff I crossed it off. No one had seen or heard anyone or anything until Zoltan had stepped out for a cigarette (no smoking is allowed in the kitchen) and had seen the station wagon and the body on the ground.
I would have let it ride that evening, no needling until tomorrow noon. When Lily Rowan phoned around seven o’clock and said Sue had phoned her from the DA’s office that she was under arrest and had to have a lawyer and would Lily send her one, and Lily wanted me to come and tell her what was what, I would have gone if I hadn’t wanted to be on hand if there was a development. But when the development came Wolfe told me not to let it in.
I straight-eyed him. "You said you’d be concerned."

Wolfe nodded. "Precisely. And I saw and heard her. And there was only one way she could know they hadn’t, with such certainty in her words and voice and manner: She knew who had. Did you form that conclusion?"
"Yes."
"Then why didn’t you go on? If she hadn’t killed him herself but knew who had, and it wasn’t one of those three men - isn’t it obvious?"
"You slipped that in, if she hadn’t killed him herself. Why hadn’t she?"
A corner of Wolfe’s mouth went up. "There it is, your one major flaw: a distorted conception of the impossible. You will reject as inconceivable such a phenomenon as a man being at two different spots simultaneously, though any adroit trickster could easily contrive it; but you consider it credible that that young woman - even after you had studied her conversation with Mr. Goodwin and me - that she concealed that piece of pipe on her person and took it there with the intention of crushing a man’s skull with it. Preposterous. That is inconceivable." He waved it away. "Of course that’s academic, now that that wretch has betrayed himself by sending me dynamite instead of corn, and the last step to my conclusion was inevitable. Since she knew who had killed Faber but wouldn’t name him, and it wasn’t one of those three, it was her father; and since she was certain - I heard and saw her say, ‘They didn’t’ - she had seen him there. I doubt if he knew it, because - but that’s immaterial. So much for - "
==> He stopped because Cramer was up, coming to my desk. He picked up the phone, dialed, and in a moment said, "Irwin? Inspector Cramer. I want Sergeant Stebbins." After another moment: "Purley? Get Carmel, the sheriff’s office. Ask him to get Duncan McLeod and hold him, and no mistake... Yes, Susan McLeod’s father. Send two men to Carmel and tell them to call in as soon as they arrive. Tell Carmel to watch it, McLeod is down for murder and he may be <==

 rough... No, that can wait. I’ll be there soon - half an hour, maybe less."
He hung up, about-faced to Wolfe, and growled, "You knew all this Wednesday afternoon, two days ago."
Wolfe nodded. "And you have known it since yesterday morning. It’s a question of interpretation, not of knowledge. Will you please sit? As you know, I like eyes at my level. Thank you. Yes, as early as Wednesday afternoon, when Miss McLeod left, I was all but certain of the identity of the murderer, but I took the precaution of seeing those three men that evening because it was just possible that one of them would disclose something cogent. They didn’t. When you came yesterday morning with that warrant, I gave you that document for two reasons: to keep Mr. Goodwin out of jail, and to share my knowledge with you. I wasn’t obliged to share also my interpretation of it. Any moment since yesterday noon I have rather expected to hear that Mr. McLeod had been taken into custody, but no."
"So you decided to share your interpretation with him instead of me."

 consciously speculate, but my subconscious must have, for suddenly, when I was busy at the potting bench, it struck me. Saul Panzer’s description of McLeod’s stony face as he read the memorandum; the stubborn ego of a self-righteous man; dynamite for stumps and rocks; corn; a closed carton. Most improbable. I resumed the potting. But conceivable. I dropped the trowel and went to the elevator, and within thirty seconds after I emerged in the hall the carton came."
"Luck," Cramer said. "Your goddam incredible luck. If it had made mincemeat of Goodwin you might have been willing to admit for once - Okay, it didn’t." He got up. "Stick around, Goodwin. They’ll want you at the DA’s office, probably in the morning." To Wolfe: "What if that phone call had said the carton held corn, just corn? You think you could have talked me off, don’t you?"
"I could have tried."
"By God. Talk about stubborn egos." Cramer shook his head. "That break you got on the carton. You know, any normal man, if he got a break like that, coming down just in the nick of time, what any normal man would do, he would go down on his knees and thank God. Do you know what you’ll do? You’ll thank you. I admit it would be a job for you to get down on your knees, but - "
==> The phone rang. I swiveled and got it, and a voice I recognized asked for Inspector Cramer. I turned and told him, "Purley Stebbins," and he came and took it. The conversation was even shorter than the one about the carton, and Cramer’s part was only a dozen words and a couple of growls. He hung up, went and got his hat, and headed for the hall, but a step short of the door he stopped and turned. <==
"I might as well tell you," he said. "It’ll give you a better appetite for dinner, even if it’s not corn. About an hour ago Duncan McLeod sat or stood or lay on a pile of dynamite and it went off. They’ve got his head and some other pieces. They’ll want to decide whether it was an accident or he did it. Maybe you can help them interpret the facts."
He turned and went.

ONE DAY LAST WEEK there was a party at Lily Rowan’s penthouse. She never invites more than six to dinner - eight counting her and me - but that was a dancing party and around coffee time a dozen more came and three musicians

"Why didn’t you stop them?" Vance demanded.
"I thought I did," I said. "With a mauler like Kirk you have to time it."
"I wouldn’t have thought..." He let it go. "Did you say he went to Nero Wolfe?"
"No, he did. But I can confirm it, I was present. He has hired Nero Wolfe. That’s why I’m here. I am collecting information that will establish the innocence of Mr. Wolfe’s client. Have you got any?"
"I’m afraid I haven’t." He was frowning. "But of course he is innocent. What Paul Fougere said, that’s ridiculous. I hope he didn’t tell the police that. But with their experience, I don’t suppose - "
==> The bell tinkled. Vance went to the door and opened it, and in came the law. Anyone with half an eye would know it was the law even if they had never seen or heard of Sergeant Purley Stebbins. Two steps in he stopped for a look and saw me. <==
"Yeah," he said, "I thought so. You and Wolfe are going to be good and sick of this one. I hope you try to hang on." His eyes went right. Fougere had appeared at the rear of the room. "Everybody, huh? I’m sorry to interrupt, Mr. Vance."
He moved. "You’re wanted downtown for more questions, Mr. Kirk. I’ll take you."
Rita made a noise. Kirk tilted his head to look up at the tough, rough face. "My God, I’ve answered all the questions there are."
"We’ve got some new ones. I might as well ask one of them now. Did you buy a typewriter at the Midtown Office Equipment Company on July nineteenth and trade in your old one?"
"Yes. I don’t know - July nineteenth - about then, yes."

 "Are you arresting me?"
"If you prefer it that way I can. Material witness. Or if you balk I’ll phone for a warrant and keep you company till it comes, maybe an hour. With Goodwin here I’ve got to toe the line. He’s hell on wheels, Goodwin is."
Kirk made it to his feet. "All right," he mumbled. He had been without sleep for thirty hours and maybe more. Rita Fougere aimed those eyes at me.
I bowed out. Being hell on wheels is fine and dandy if you have anywhere to steer for, but I hadn’t. I went and opened the door and on out, took the elevator down, exchanged no greeting with the driver of the police car out front, though we had met, walked till I found a taxi, and told the hackie 618 West 35th Street; and when he said that was Nero Wolfe’s house I actually said such is fame. That’s the shape I was in.
Wolfe was at table in the dining room, putting a gob of his favorite cheese on a wafer. When I entered he looked up and said politely, "Fritz is keeping the kidneys warm."
==> I stopped three steps in. "Many thanks," I said even more politely. "You were right as usual; the conversation was futile. They had a tail on Kirk, here and to the hotel and on to Horn Street. When Purley Stebbins arrived at Vance’s apartment he knew Kirk was there and he wasn’t surprised to see me. He had come for your client and took him. They have found the typewriter that addressed that envelope to me and the message. It belonged to Kirk, but on July nineteenth he traded it in on another one. Since you don’t talk business at meals, I’ll eat in the kitchen." <==
I wheeled, hell on wheels, and went to the kitchen.
87
NEARLY FOUR HOURS LATER, at six o’clock, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Fougere were in the office, waiting for Wolfe to come down from the plant rooms - she in the red leather chair and he in one of the yellow ones in front of Wolfe’s desk. To my surprise he had two marks, a red slightly puffed nose and a little bruise under his left eye. I hadn’t thought Kirk had shown that much power, but of course with bare knuckles it doesn’t take much.

"No." I was emphatic. "For once you’ll have to skip it. The six hours is up at four o’clock, and if you put it off until six Cramer may let him go home, with or without an escort, and he might find that both the tie and the keepsake are gone. Would that be satisfactory?"
Silence. "No." More silence. "Confound it." Still more. "Very well. Fritz will have something ready."
"Better make it half past and - " He had hung up.

INSPECTOR CRAMER SETTLED BACK in the red leather chair, narrowed his eyes at Wolfe, and rasped, "I’ve told Mr. Vance that this won’t be on any official record and he can answer your questions or not as he pleases."
==> He wouldn’t have settled back if he had been the only city employee present, since he knew that almost certainly some fur was going to fly. Sergeant Purley Stebbins was there at his right on a chair against the wall. Purley never sits with his back to anyone, even his superior officer, if he can help it. James Neville Vance was on a chair facing Wolfe’s desk, between Cramer and me. Rita Fougere was on the couch at the left of my desk, and Saul and Fred and Orrie were grouped over by the big globe. <==
"There won’t be many questions," Wolfe told Cramer. "Nothing remains to be satisfied but my curiosity on a point or two." His head turned. "Mr. Vance, only you can satisfy it." To me: "Archie?"
I regretted having to take my eyes away from Vance. Not that I thought he needed watching; it was just that I wanted to. You can learn things, or you think you can, from the face of a man who knows something is headed for him but doesn’t know exactly what and is trying to be ready to meet it. Up to that point Vance’s face hadn’t increased my knowledge of human nature. His lips were drawn in tight, and that made his oversized chin even more out of proportion.

 When Wolfe cued me I had to leave it. I got the seven ties from a drawer, put them in a row on Wolfe’s desk, and stood by.
"Those," Wolfe told Vance, "are the seven ties that remained on the rack in your closet. I produce them - "

"I didn’t phone him."
I must say that Vance was showing more gumption than I had expected. By letting Wolfe talk he was finding out exactly how deep the hole was, and he was saying nothing.
Wolfe turned a hand over. "Now the primary why: why did you kill her? I learned yesterday that you probably had an adequate motive, but as I told Mr. Cramer, that was only hearsay. I had to have a demonstrable fact, an act or an object, and you supplied it. Not yesterday or today; you supplied it Tuesday afternoon when, after killing Mrs. Kirk, you stooped over her battered skull, or knelt or squatted, and cut off a lock of her hair, choosing one that had her blood on it. With a knife, or scissors? Did you stoop, or squat, or kneel?"
Vance’s lips moved, but no sound came. Unquestionably he was trying to say "I didn’t" but couldn’t make it.
Wolfe grunted. "I said a demonstrable fact. To demonstrate is to establish as true, and I’ll establish it. Mr. Goodwin found the lock of hair, caked with blood, some two hours ago, in a drawer in your bedroom. He called it a keepsake, but a keepsake is something given and kept for the sake of the giver, a token of friendship. Trophy would be a better term." He opened a desk drawer.
==> I can move fast and so can Purley Stebbins, but we both misjudged James Neville Vance, at least I did. When he started up at sight of the glove Wolfe took <==

 from the drawer I started too, but I wasn’t expecting him to dart like lightning, and he did; and he got the glove, snatched it out of Wolfe’s hand. Of course he didn’t keep it long. I came from his left side and Purley from his right, and since he had the glove in his right hand it was Purley who got his wrist and twisted it, and the glove dropped to the floor.
Cramer picked it up. Purley had Vance by the right arm, and I had him by the left.
Wolfe stood up. "It’s in the glove," he told Cramer. "Mr. Goodwin, will furnish any details you require, and Mrs. Fougere." He headed for the door. The clock said 5:22. His schedule had hit a snag, but by gum it wasn’t wrecked.

A LITTLE BEFORE FIVE o’clock one afternoon last week the doorbell rang, and through the one-way glass I saw Martin Kirk on the stoop, his overcoat collar turned up and his hat on tight. When I opened the door snow came whirling in. Obviously he was calling on me, not Wolfe, since he knew the schedule, and I was glad to see an ex-client who had paid his bill promptly, so I took his hat and coat and put them on the rack, and ushered him to the office and a chair. When we had exchanged a few remarks about the weather, and his health and mine, and Wolfe’s, and he had declined an offer of a drink, he said he saw that Vance’s lawyer was trying a new approach on an appeal, and I said yeah, when you’ve got money you can do a lot of dodging. With that disposed of, he said he often wondered where he would be now if he hadn’t come straight to Wolfe from the DA’s office that day in August.
"Look," I said, "you’ve said that before. I have all the time there is and I enjoy your company, but you didn’t come all the way here through the worst storm this winter just to chew the fat. Something on your mind?"

Fifty hours went by.
Like you and everyone else, I have various sources of information about what goes on: newspapers, magazines, radio, television, taxicab drivers, random talk here and there, friends, and enemies. I also have two special ones: Lon Cohen, confidential assistant to the publisher of the Gazette, and a woman who is on intimate terms, not familial, with a certain highly distinguished citizen, for whom I once did a big favor. But the news of the arrest of Dunbar Whipple came from none of those sources; it came from Inspector Cramer of Homicide South, whom I couldn't exactly call an enemy and wouldn't presume to call a friend.
During the two days I had not only read the newspapers but had also phoned Lon Cohen a couple of times to ask if there was anything hot about the Susan Brooke murder that wasn't being printed. There wasn't, unless you would call it hot that her brother Kenneth had socked an assistant district attorney on the beak, or that there was nothing to the rumor that it was being hushed up that she had been pregnant. She hadn't been. Of course a lot was being printed: that her handbag, on a table in the apartment, had had more than a hundred dollars in it; that an expensive gold pin had been on her dress and a ring with a big emerald had been on her finger (I had seen the ring); that she had bought a bottle of wine at a package store, and several items at a delicatessen, shortly before eight o'clock; that her mother was prostrated and inaccessible; that everyone at the ROCC had been or was being questioned; and so on. The News came out ahead on shots of Susan Brooke, with one in a bikini on a Puerto Rico beach, but the Gazette had the best one of Dunbar Whipple. Handsome and jaunty.
I wasn't surprised when, at 6:03 Thursday afternoon, Inspector Cramer showed. I

==>  had been expecting him or Sergeant Purley Stebbins, or at least a phone call, since Wednesday noon, when Lily Rowan had phoned to tell me she had had an official caller. Of course they had done a routine check on Susan Brooke's recent activities, of course someone at the ROCC had told them about her lunch with Miss Lily Rowan and Lily's contribution to the cause, of course they had called on Miss Rowan, and of course Lily had told the caller about me, since someone else would - for instance, the hallman - if she didn't. So I had been expecting company, and when the doorbell rang and I saw Cramer's burly figure and round red face and battered old felt hat on the stoop, I went and opened up and said, peeved, "You took your time. We've been expecting you for days." <==
He spoke to me as he entered. Sometimes he doesn't; he just tramps down the hall. The fact that he spoke, and even thanked me for taking his hat and coat, showed that he had come not to claim but to ask. When he entered the office, naturally he didn't offer a hand, since he knows that Wolfe is not a shaker, but before he lowered his fanny onto the red leather chair he uttered a polite greeting and actually made a try at being sociable by asking, "And how are the orchids?"
Wolfe's brows went up. "Passable, thank you. A pot of Miltonia roezli has fourteen scapes."
"Is that so." Cramer sat and pulled his feet in. "Busy? Am I interrupting something?"
"No, sir."
"No case and no client?"

I came to a stop across the street from 63 Arbor Street. But the thermometer outside the front-room window had said sixteen above zero when I got up, and it had climbed only about five notches since, and I had the keys in my pocket, so I crossed the street, entered, and mounted the two flights to Althaus's apartment. I include this in the report not because it changed anything, but because I

 remember so well my state of mind. Fifty-three hours had passed since I had put the gun under the box spring, and that was time enough for a healthy girl to find a dozen guns and put them somewhere else. If it wasn't there we would now be out on a limb, and a shaky one, since I had told Cramer. He knew Wolfe hadn't sent me there just on a suspicion or a hunch; he knew we knew there was something hot in that apartment, and if it was gone we were in for it. If I told him about the gun I would be admitting I had tampered with evidence; if I didn't, I would be suspected of something even worse, and good-by licenses.
You may not be interested in my state of mind, but believe me I was. At one of the front windows in Althaus's living room I pushed the drape aside and pressed my forehead against the glass so I could see the sidewalk below. That was fairly dumb, but a state of mind cars make you dumb. It was 3:25. I had left Cramer only thirty-five minutes ago, and it would take them about an hour to get the warrant, so what was I expecting to see? Also the glass was cold, and I backed away a couple of inches. But I was really on edge, and now and then I put my forehead to the glass again, and after a while I did see something. Sarah Dacos came in view on the sidewalk with a big brown paper bag under her arm and turned in at the entrance. It was ten minutes to four. Seeing her didn't help my state of mind any. I had nothing against Sarah Dacos. Of course I had nothing for her either. A woman who sends a bullet through a man's pump may or may not deserve some sympathy, but she damn well can't expect a stranger to take a detour if she gets in his way while he's doing a job.
Bending my ears, I heard the door of her apartment open and close.
==> At a quarter past four two police cars stopped out in front. One of them found a spot at the curb and the other one double-parked, and I recognized all three of the homicide dicks who got out and headed for Number 63. One of them, Sergeant Purley Stebbins, was probably thinking of me as he pushed the button at the door. He hates to find Nero Wolfe or me in the same county with a homicide, and here he was on an errand we were responsible for. I wanted to go to the hall to hear the conversation when he showed her the warrant, but didn't. He might smell me and it would hold up the search. <==
It took them not more than ten minutes to find it. They entered the apartment at 4:21, that was when I heard the door close, and Purley left the house with her at 4:43. I'm allowing twelve minutes for him to ask her a few questions after he got the gun. I stood at the window and watched Purley get in the car with her, and

 the car pull off, and then went and sat on the couch. Since he had taken her, the question about the gun was answered. I stayed on the couch a few minutes while my state of mind got adjusted.
I got my hat and coat and went. There was still a NYPD car out in front, waiting for the two dicks still in the apartment, and the driver might know me, but so what? I hadn't recognized him from the window, and I don't know if he knew me or not. As I walked past the car, no hurry, he gave me a hard eye, but that could have been because I had come out of that house.
I walked home. It was a little after half past five, dark, when I mounted the stoop and let myself in. I went to the kitchen, got a glass of milk, and asked Fritz, "Has he told you that we're off the hook?"

But by the time I had reached the door I had changed my mind. Not because of him. He looked perfectly normal - big and burly, round red face with bushy gray eyebrows, broad heavy shoulders straining the sleeve seams of his coat. It was the carton. It was a used one, the right size, the cord around it was the kind McLeod used, and the NERO WOLFE on it in blue crayon was McLeod’s style of printing. Having switched the stoop light on, I could observe those details as I approached, so I swung the door open and asked politely, "Where did you get the corn?"
==> I suppose I should explain a little. Usually Wolfe comes closest to being human after dinner, when we leave the dining room to cross the hall to the office, and he gets his bulk deposited in his favorite chair behind his desk, and Fritz brings coffee; and either Wolfe opens his current book or, if I have no date and am staying in, he starts a conversation. The topic may be anything from women’s shoes to the importance of the new moon in Babylonian astrology. But that evening he had taken his cup and crossed to the big globe over by the bookshelves and stood twirling the globe, scowling at it, probably picking a place he would rather be. <==
For the corn hadn’t come. By an arrangement with a farmer named Duncan McLeod up in Putman County, every Tuesday from July 20 to October 5, sixteen ears of just-picked corn were delivered. They were roasted in the husk, and we did our own shucking as we ate - four ears for me, eight for Wolfe, and four in the kitchen for Fritz. The corn had to arrive no earlier than five-thirty and no later than six-thirty. That day it hadn’t arrived at all, and Fritz had had to do some stuffed eggplant, so Wolfe was standing scowling at the globe when the doorbell rang.


And now here was Inspector Cramer with the carton. Could it possibly be it? It was. Handing me his hat to put on the shelf, he tramped down the hall to the office, and when I entered he had put the carton on Wolfe’s desk and had his knife out to cut the cord, and Wolfe, cup in hand, was crossing to him. Cramer opened the flaps, took out an ear of corn, held it up, and said, "If you were going to have this for dinner, I guess it’s too late."
Wolfe moved to his elbow, turned the flap to see the inscription, his name, grunted, circled around the desk to his chair, and sat. "You have your effect," he said. "I am impressed. Where did you get it?"

"If you don’t know, maybe Goodwin does." Cramer shot a glance at me, went to the red leather chair facing the end of Wolfe’s desk, and sat. "I’ve got some questions for you and for him, but of course you want grounds. You would. At a quarter past five, four hours ago, the dead body of a man was found in the alley back of Rusterman’s restaurant. He had been hit in the back of the head with a piece of iron pipe which was there on the ground by the body. The station wagon he had come in was alongside the receiving platform of the restaurant, and in the station wagon were nine cartons containing ears of corn." Cramer pointed. "That’s one of them, your name on it. You get one like it every Tuesday. Right?"

"I’ve got some questions for you and for him, but of course you want grounds. You would.

"That’s one of them, your name on it. You get one like it every Tuesday. Right?"
Wolfe nodded. "I do. In season. Has the body been identified?"
"Yes. Driver’s license and other items in his pockets, including cash, eighty- some dollars. Kenneth Faber, twenty-eight years old. Also men at the restaurant identified him. He had been delivering the corn there the past five weeks, and then he had been coming on here with yours. Right?"
"I don’t know."
"The hell you don’t. If you’re going to start that kind - "
==> I cut in. "Hold it. Stay in the buggy. As you know, Mr. Wolfe is up in the plant rooms from four to six every day except Sunday. The corn usually comes before six, and either Fritz or I receive it. So Mr. Wolfe doesn’t know, but I do. Kenneth Faber has been bringing it the past five weeks. If you want - " <==
I stopped because Wolfe was moving. Cramer had dropped the ear of corn onto Wolfe’s desk, and Wolfe had picked it up and felt it, gripping it in the middle,

 and now he was shucking it. From where I sat, at my desk, the rows of kernels looked too big, too yellow, and too crowded. Wolfe frowned at it, muttered, "I thought so," put it down, stood up, reached for the carton, said, "You will help, Archie," took an ear, and started shucking it. As I got up Cramer said something but was ignored.
When we finished we had three piles, as assorted by Wolfe. Two ears were too young, six were too old, and eight were just right. He returned to his chair, looked at Cramer, and declared, "This is preposterous."
"So you’re stalling," Cramer growled. "No. Shall I expound it?"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 23    window = 18 28

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 73259    window = 73254 73264


"So you’re stalling," Cramer growled. "No. Shall I expound it?"
"Yeah. Go ahead."
"Since you have questioned men at the restaurant, you know that the corn comes from a man named Duncan McLeod, who grows it on a farm some sixty miles north of here. He has been supplying it for four years, and he knows precisely what I require. It must be nearly mature, but not quite, and it must be picked not more than three hours before it reaches me. Do you eat sweet corn?"
"Yes. You’re stalling."
"No. Who cooks it?"
==> "My wife. I haven’t got a Fritz." "Does she cook it in water?" "Sure. Is yours cooked in beer?" <==
"No. Millions of American women, and some men, commit that outrage every summer day. They are turning a superb treat into mere provender. Shucked and boiled in water, sweet corn is edible and nutritious; roasted in the husk in the hottest possible oven for forty minutes, shucked at the table, and buttered and salted, nothing else, it is ambrosia. No chef’s ingenuity and imagination have ever created a finer dish. American women should themselves be boiled in water. Ideally the corn - "
"How much longer are you going to stall?"


"I’m not stalling. Ideally the corn should go straight from the stalk to the oven, but of course that’s impractical for city dwellers. If it’s picked at the right stage of development it is still a treat for the palate after twenty-four hours, or even forty-eight; I have tried it. But look at this." Wolfe pointed to the assorted piles. "This is preposterous. Mr. McLeod knows better. The first year I had him send two dozen ears, and I returned those that were not acceptable. He knows what I require, and he knows how to choose it without opening the husk. He is supposed to be equally meticulous with the supply for the restaurant, but I doubt if he is; they take fifteen to twenty dozen. Are they serving what they got today?"

In helping them get it on the record that I knew all that, I learned only that they had found no one who had seen the murderer in the alley or entering or leaving it, that Faber had probably been dead five to ten minutes when someone came from the kitchen to the platform and found the body, and that the weapon was a piece of two-inch galvanized iron pipe sixteen and five-eighths inches long,

 threaded male at one end and female at the other, old and battered. Easy to hide under a coat. Where it came from might be discovered by one man in ten hours, or by a thousand men in ten years.
Getting those details was nothing, since they would be in the morning papers, but regarding their slant on me I got some hints that the papers wouldn’t have. Hints were the best I could get, no facts to check, so I’ll just report how it looked when Parker came to spring me in the morning. They hadn’t let me see Sue’s statement, but it must have been something in it, or something she had said, or something someone else, maybe Carl Heydt or Peter Jay or Max Maslow, had said, either to her or to the cops. Or possibly something Duncan McLeod, Sue’s father, had said. That didn’t seem likely, but I included him because I saw him. When Parker and I entered the anteroom on our way out he was there on a chair in the row against the wall, dressed for town, with a necktie, his square deep- tanned face shiny with sweat. I crossed over and told him good morning, and he said it wasn’t, it was a bad morning, a day lost and no one to leave to see to things. It was no place for a talk, with people there on the chairs, but I might at least have asked him who had picked the corn if someone hadn’t come to take him inside.
So when I climbed out of the taxi at the corner and thanked Parker for the lift and told him I’d call him if and when, and walked the block and a half on 35th Street to the old brownstone, I was worse off than when I had left, since I hadn’t learned anything really useful, and no matter how Parker defined "moderate," the cost of a twenty-grand bond is not peanuts. I couldn’t expect to pass the buck to Wolfe, since he had never seen either Kenneth Faber or Sue McLeod, and as I mounted the seven steps to the stoop and put my key in the lock I decided not to try to.
==> The key wasn’t enough. The door opened two inches and stopped. The chain bolt was on. I pushed the button, and Fritz came and slipped the bolt; and his face told me something was stirring before he spoke. If you’re not onto the faces you see most of, how can you expect to tell anything from strange ones? As I crossed the sill I said, "Good morning. What’s up?" <==
He turned from closing the door and stared. "But Archie. You look terrible." "I feel worse. Now what?"
"A woman to see you. Miss Susan McLeod. She used to bring - "

 "Yeah. Where is she?"
"In the office."

I got a glass from the cupboard, went to the refrigerator and got milk, filled the glass, and took a sip. "If you could see the bacon and eggs they had brought in for me and I paid two bucks for, let alone taste it, you’d never be the same. You’d be so afraid you might be hauled in as a material witness you’d lose your nerve. They think maybe I killed Faber. For your information, I didn’t." I sipped milk. "This will hold me till lunch. I understand I have a caller. As you told Parker, this is my affair and you are not concerned. May I take her to the front room? I’m not intimate enough with her to take her up to my room." I sipped milk.
"Confound it," he growled. "How much of what you told Mr. Cramer was flummery?"
"None. All straight. But he’s on me and so is the DA, and I’ve got to find out why." I sipped milk.

He was eying me. "You will see Miss McLeod in the office." "The front room will do. It may be an hour. Two hours." "You may need the telephone. The office."
==> If I had been myself I would have given that offer a little attention, but I was somewhat pooped. So I went, taking my half a glass of milk. The door to the office was closed and, entering, I closed it again. She wasn’t in the red leather chair. Since she was there for me, not for Wolfe, Fritz had moved up one of the yellow chairs for her, but hearing the door open and seeing me she had sprung up, and by the time I had shut the door and turned she was to me, gripping my arms, her head tilted back to get my eyes. If it hadn’t been for the milk I would have used my arms for one of their basic functions, since that’s a sensible way to start a good frank talk with a girl. That being impractical, I tilted my head forward and kissed her. Not just a peck. She not only took it, she helped, and her grip on my arms tightened, and I had to keep the glass plumb by feel since I couldn’t see it. It wouldn’t have been polite for me to quit, so I left it to her. <==
She let go, backed up a step, and said, "You haven’t shaved."
I crossed to my desk, sipped milk, put the glass down, and said, "I spent the night at the district attorney’s office, and I’m tired, dirty, and sour. I could shower and shave and change in half an hour."
"You’re all right." She plumped onto the chair. "Look at me."
"I am looking at you." I sat. "You’d do fine for a before-and-after vitamin ad. The before. Did you get to bed?"
"I guess so, I don’t know." Her mouth opened to pull air in. Not a yawn, just helping her nose. "It couldn’t have been a jail because the windows didn’t have bars. They kept me until after midnight asking questions, and one of them took me home. Oh yes, I went to bed, but I didn’t sleep, but I must have, because I woke up. Archie, I don’t know what you’re going to do to me."

"Of course not. How could I? There’s only one way a girl can get pregnant, and it couldn’t have been that with me because it’s never happened."

< class="sgc48" id="heading_id_63
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE, I like to kid myself that I know why I think this or do that, but sometimes it just won’t work, and that was once. I don’t mean why I believed her about not being pregnant and how she knew she couldn’t be; I do know that; it was the way she said it and the way she looked. I had known her three years. But since, if I believed her on that, I had to scrap the item I had just given Wolfe for ‘no’ on her killing Faber, why didn’t I change the odds to even money? I pass. I could cook up a case, for instance if she was straight on one thing, about not being pregnant and why not, she was probably straight on other things too, but who would buy it? It’s even possible that every man alive, of whom I am one, has a feeling down below that an unmarried girl who knows she can’t be pregnant is less apt to commit murder than one who can’t be sure. I admit that a good private detective shouldn’t have feelings down below, but have you any suggestions?
Since Wolfe pretends to think I could qualify on the witness stand as an expert on attractive young women, of course he turned to me and said, "Archie?" and I nodded yes. An expert shouldn’t back and fill, and as I just said, I believed her on the pregnancy issue. Wolfe grunted, told me to take my notebook, gave her a hard eye for five seconds, and started in.
==> An hour and ten minutes later, when Fritz came to announce lunch, I had filled most of a new notebook and Wolfe was leaning back with his eyes shut and his lips tight. It was evident that he was going to have to work. She had answered all his questions with no apparent fumbling, and it still looked very much as if either I was going to ride the bumps or she was. Or possibly both. <==
As she told it, she had met Ken Faber eight months ago at a party at the apartment of Peter Jay. Ken had been fast on the follow-up and four months later, in May, she had told him she would marry him some day - say in two or three years, when she was ready to give up modeling - if he had shown that he could support a family. From the notebook: "I was making over eight hundred dollars a week, ten times as much as he was, and of course if I got married I couldn’t expect to keep that up. I don’t think a married woman should model anyway because if you’re married you ought to have babies, and there’s no telling what that will do to you, and who looks after the babies?"
In June, at his request, she had got her father to give him a job on the farm, but

 she had soon regretted it. From the notebook: "Of course he knew I went to the farm weekends in the summer, and the very first weekend it was easy to see what his idea was. He thought it would be different on the farm than in town, it would be easy to get me to do what he wanted, as easy as falling off a log. The second week it was worse, and the third week it was still worse, and I was seeing what he was really like and I wished I hadn’t said I would marry him. He accused me of letting other men do what I wouldn’t let him do, and he tried to make me promise I wouldn’t date any other man, even for dinner or a show. Then the last week in July he seemed to get some sense, and I thought maybe he had just gone through some kind of a phase or something, but last week, Friday evening, he was worse than ever all of a sudden, and Sunday he told me he had told Archie Goodwin that I thought I was pregnant and he was responsible, and of course Archie would pass it on, and if I denied it no one would believe me, and the only thing to do was to get married right away. That was when I told him I’d like to kill him. Then the next day, Monday, Carl - Carl Heydt - told me that Ken had told him the same thing, and I suspected he had told two other men, on account of things they had said, and I decided to go there Tuesday and see him. I was going to tell him he had to tell Archie and Carl it was a lie, and anybody else he had told, and if I had to I’d get a lawyer."
If that was straight, and the part about Carl Heydt and Peter Jay and Max Maslow could be checked, that made it more like ten to one that she hadn’t killed him. She couldn’t have ad-libbed it; she would have had to go there intending to kill him, or at least bruise him, since she couldn’t have just happened to have with her a piece of two-inch pipe sixteen inches long. Say twenty to one. But if she hadn’t, who had? Better than twenty to one, not some thug. There had been eighty bucks in Ken’s pockets, and why would a thug go up that alley with the piece of pipe, much less hide under the platform with it? No. It had to be someone out for Ken specifically who knew that spot, or at least knew about it, and knew he would come there, and when.

"No," she said. "I won’t."
He glared at her. If she had been merely a client, with nothing but a fee at stake, he would have told her to either do as she was told or clear out, but the stake was an errand boy it would be a calamity to lose, me, as he had admitted in my hearing. So he turned the glare off and turned a palm up. "Miss McLeod. I concede that your refusal to think ill of a friend is commendable. I concede that Mr. Faber may have been killed by someone you have never heard of with a motive you can’t even conjecture - and by the way, I haven’t asked you: do you know of anyone who might have had a ponderable reason for killing him?"
"No."
"But it’s possible that Mr. Heydt does, or Mr. Jay or Mr. Maslow. Even accepting your conclusion that none of them killed him, I must see them. I must also see your father, but separately - I’ll attend to that. My only possible path to the murderer is the motive, and one or more of those four men, who knew Mr. Faber, may start me on it. I ask you to have those three here this evening. Not you with them."
She was frowning. "But you can’t... you said identify him. How can you?" "I don’t know. Perhaps I can’t, but I must try. Nine o’clock?"
==> She didn’t want to, even after the concessions he had made, but she had to admit that we had to get some kind of information from somebody, and who else was there to start with? So she finally agreed, definitely, and Wolfe leaned back with his eyes shut and his lips tight, and Fritz came to announce lunch. Sue got up to go, and when I returned after seeing her to the door and out, Wolfe had crossed to the dining room and was at the table. Instead of joining him, I stood and said, "Ordinarily I would think I was well worth it, but right now I’m no bargain at any price. Have we a program for the afternoon?" <==

No. Except to telephone Mr. McLeod."
"I saw him at the DA’s office. Then I’m going up and rinse off before I eat. I think I smell. Tell Fritz to save me a bite in the kitchen."
I went to the hall and mounted the two flights to my room. During the forty minutes it took to do the job I kept telling my brain to lay off until it caught up, but it wouldn’t. It insisted on trying to analyze the situation, with the emphasis on Sue McLeod. If I had her figured wrong, if she was it, it would almost certainly be a waste of time to try to get anything from three guys who were absolutely hooked, and if there was no program for the afternoon I had damn well better think one up. If it would be a calamity for Wolfe to lose me for good, what would it be for me? By the time I stepped into the shower the brain had it doped that the main point was the piece of pipe. She had not gone into that alley toting that pipe; that was out. But I hadn’t got that point settled conclusively by Cramer or Mandel, and I hadn’t seen a morning paper. I would consult the Times when I went downstairs. But the brain wanted to know now, and when I left the shower I dried in a hurry, went to the phone on the bedtable, dialed the Gazette, got Lon Cohen, and asked him. Of course he knew I had spent the night downtown and he wanted a page or two of facts, but I told him I was naked and would catch cold, and how final was it that whoever had conked Faber had brought the pipe with him? Sewed up, Lon said. Positively. The pipe was at the laboratory, revealing - maybe - its past to the scientists, and three or four dicks with color photos of it were trying to pick up its trail. I thanked him and promised him something for a headline if and when. So that was settled. As I went to a drawer for clean shorts the brain started in on Carl Heydt, but it had darned little to work on, and by the time I tied my tie it was buzzing around trying to find a place to land.
Downstairs, Wolfe was still in the dining room, but I went on by to the kitchen, got at my breakfast table with the Times, and was served by Fritz with what do you think? Corn fritters. There had been eight perfectly good ears, and Fritz hates to throw good food away. With bacon and homemade blackberry jam they were ambrosia, and in the Times report on the Faber murder Wolfe’s name was mentioned twice and mine four times, so it was a fine meal. I had finished the eighth fritter and was deciding whether to take on another one and a third cup of coffee when the doorbell rang, and I got up and went to the hall for a look. Wolfe was back in the office, and I stuck my head in and said, "McLeod."

"But it’s possible that Mr. Heydt does, or Mr. Jay or Mr. Maslow. Even accepting your conclusion that none of them killed him, I must see them. I must also see your father, but separately - I’ll attend to that. My only possible path to the murderer is the motive, and one or more of those four men, who knew Mr. Faber, may start me on it. I ask you to have those three here this evening. Not you with them."
She was frowning. "But you can’t... you said identify him. How can you?" "I don’t know. Perhaps I can’t, but I must try. Nine o’clock?"
She didn’t want to, even after the concessions he had made, but she had to admit that we had to get some kind of information from somebody, and who else was there to start with? So she finally agreed, definitely, and Wolfe leaned back with his eyes shut and his lips tight, and Fritz came to announce lunch. Sue got up to go, and when I returned after seeing her to the door and out, Wolfe had crossed to the dining room and was at the table. Instead of joining him, I stood and said, "Ordinarily I would think I was well worth it, but right now I’m no bargain at any price. Have we a program for the afternoon?"

No. Except to telephone Mr. McLeod."
==> "I saw him at the DA’s office. Then I’m going up and rinse off before I eat. I think I smell. Tell Fritz to save me a bite in the kitchen." <==
I went to the hall and mounted the two flights to my room. During the forty minutes it took to do the job I kept telling my brain to lay off until it caught up, but it wouldn’t. It insisted on trying to analyze the situation, with the emphasis on Sue McLeod. If I had her figured wrong, if she was it, it would almost certainly be a waste of time to try to get anything from three guys who were absolutely hooked, and if there was no program for the afternoon I had damn well better think one up. If it would be a calamity for Wolfe to lose me for good, what would it be for me? By the time I stepped into the shower the brain had it doped that the main point was the piece of pipe. She had not gone into that alley toting that pipe; that was out. But I hadn’t got that point settled conclusively by Cramer or Mandel, and I hadn’t seen a morning paper. I would consult the Times when I went downstairs. But the brain wanted to know now, and when I left the shower I dried in a hurry, went to the phone on the bedtable, dialed the Gazette, got Lon Cohen, and asked him. Of course he knew I had spent the night downtown and he wanted a page or two of facts, but I told him I was naked and would catch cold, and how final was it that whoever had conked Faber had brought the pipe with him? Sewed up, Lon said. Positively. The pipe was at the laboratory, revealing - maybe - its past to the scientists, and three or four dicks with color photos of it were trying to pick up its trail. I thanked him and promised him something for a headline if and when. So that was settled. As I went to a drawer for clean shorts the brain started in on Carl Heydt, but it had darned little to work on, and by the time I tied my tie it was buzzing around trying to find a place to land.
Downstairs, Wolfe was still in the dining room, but I went on by to the kitchen, got at my breakfast table with the Times, and was served by Fritz with what do you think? Corn fritters. There had been eight perfectly good ears, and Fritz hates to throw good food away. With bacon and homemade blackberry jam they were ambrosia, and in the Times report on the Faber murder Wolfe’s name was mentioned twice and mine four times, so it was a fine meal.

Wolfe was back in the office, and I stuck my head in and said, "McLeod."

He let out a growl. True, he had told Sue he must see her father and was even going to phone to ask him to come in from the country, but he always resents an unexpected visitor, no matter who. Ignoring the growl, I went to the front and opened the door, and when McLeod said he wanted to see Mr. Wolfe, with his burr on the r, I invited him in, took his Sunday hat, a dark gray antique fedora in good condition, put it on the shelf, and took him to the office. Wolfe, who is no hand-shaker, told him good afternoon and motioned to the red leather chair.
McLeod stood. "No need to sit," he said. "I’ve been told about the corn and I came to apologize. I’m to blame, and I’d like to explain how it happened. I didn’t pick it; that young man did. Kenneth Faber."

Wolfe grunted. "Wasn’t that heedless? I telephoned the restaurant this morning and was told that theirs was as bad as mine. You know what we require."
He nodded. "I ought to by now. You pay a good price, and I want to say it’ll never happen again. I’d like to explain it. A man was coming Thursday with a bulldozer to work on a lot I’m clearing, but Monday night he told me he’d have to come Wednesday instead, and I had to dynamite a lot of stumps and rock before he came. I got at it by daylight yesterday and I thought I could finish in time to pick the corn, but I had some trouble and I had to leave the corn to that young man. I had showed him and I thought he knew. So I’ve got to apologize and I’ll see it don’t happen again. Of course I’m not expecting you to pay for it."

It was after one o’clock when I climbed out of a cab in front of the old brownstone on West 35th Street, mounted the stoop, used my key, went down the hall to the office and switched the light on, and got a surprise. Under a paperweight on my desk was a note in Wolfe’s handwriting. It said:
AG: Saul will take the car in the morning, probably for most of the day. His car is not presently available. NW
I went to the safe, manipulated the knob, opened the door, got the petty-cash book from the drawer, flipped to the current page, and saw an entry:
10/14 SP exp AG 100
I put it back, shut the door, twirled the knob, and considered Wolfe had summoned Saul, and he had come and had been given an errand for which he needed a car. What errand, for God’s sake? Not to drive to Putman County to get the corn that had been ordered for Friday; for that he wouldn’t need to start in the morning, he wouldn’t need a hundred bucks for possible expenses, and the entry wouldn’t say "exp AG." It shouldn’t say that anyway since I wasn’t a paying client; it should say "exp JA" for joint affair. And if we were going to split the outlay I should damn well have been consulted beforehand. But up in my room, as I took off and put on, what was biting me was the errand. In the name of the Almighty Lord or J. Edgar Hoover, whichever you prefer, what and where was the errand?
==> Wolfe eats breakfast in his room from a tray taken up by Fritz, and ordinarily I don’t see him until he comes down from the plant rooms at eleven o’clock. If he has something important or complicated for me he sends word by Fritz for me to go up to his room; for something trivial he gets me on the house phone. That Friday morning there was neither word by Fritz nor the buzzer, and after a late and leisurely breakfast in the kitchen, having learned nothing new from the report of developments in the morning papers on the Sweet Corn Murder, as the Gazette called it, I went to the office and opened the mail. If Wolfe saw fit to <==

ep Saul’s errand strictly private, he could eat wormy old corn boiled in water before I’d ask him. I decided to go out for a walk and was starting for the kitchen to tell Fritz when the phone rang. I got it, and a woman said she was the secretary of Mr. Bernard Ross, counsel for Miss Susan McLeod, and Mr. Ross would like very much to talk with Mr. Wolfe and Mr. Goodwin at their earliest convenience. He would greatly appreciate it if they would call at his office today, this morning if possible.
I would have enjoyed telling Wolfe that Bernard Ross, the celebrated attorney, didn’t know that Nero Wolfe, the celebrated detective, never left his house to call on anyone whoever, but since I wasn’t on speaking terms with him I had to skip it. I told the secretary that Wolfe couldn’t but I could and would, went and told Fritz I would probably be back for lunch, put a carbon copy of the twelve- page conversation with affidavits in my pocket, and departed.
I did get back for lunch, just barely. Including the time he took to study the document I had brought, Ross kept me a solid two hours and a half. When I left he knew nearly everything I did, but not quite; I omitted a few items that were immaterial as far as he was concerned - for instance, that Wolfe had sent Saul Panzer somewhere to do something. Since I couldn’t tell him where, to do what, there was no point in mentioning it.
I would have preferred to buy my lunch somewhere, say at Rusterman’s, rather than sit through a meal with Wolfe, but he would be the one to gripe, not me, if he didn’t know where I was. Entering his house, and hearing him in the dining room speaking to Fritz, I went first to the office, and there on my desk under a paperweight were four sawbucks. Leaving them there, I went to the dining room and said good morning, though it wasn’t.

question had arisen whether he was more pigheaded than I was strong- minded. I was supposed to explode. I was supposed to demand to know where and how Saul had spent the six hours, and he would then be good enough to explain that he had got an idea last night in my absence, and, not knowing where I was, he had had to call Saul. So I wouldn’t explode. I would eat shrimp Bordelaise without onions but with garlic and like it. Obviously, whatever Saul’s errand had been, it had been a washout, since he had returned and reported and been paid off. So it was Wolfe’s move, since he had refused to see the three candidates when they came and rang the bell, and I would not explode. Nor would I report on last night or this morning unless and until he asked for it. Back in the office after lunch, he got settled in his favorite chair with My Life in Court, and I brought a file of cards from the cabinet and got busy with the germination records. At one minute to four he put his book down and went to keep his date with the orchids. It would have been a pleasure to take the Marley .32 from the drawer and plug him in the back.
I was at my desk, looking through the evening edition of the Gazette that had just been delivered, when I heard a noise I couldn’t believe. The elevator. I looked at my watch: half past five. That was unprecedented. He never did that. Once in the plant rooms he stuck there for the two hours, no matter what. If he had a notion that couldn’t wait he buzzed me on the house phone, or Fritz if I wasn’t there. I dropped the paper and got up and stepped to the hall. The elevator jolted to a stop at the bottom, the door opened, and he emerged.
"The corn," he said. "Has it come?"

For Pete’s sake. Being finicky about grub is all right up to a point, but there’s a limit. "No," I said. "Unless Saul brought it."
He grunted. "A possibility occurred to me. When it comes - if it comes - no. I’ll see for myself. The possibility is remote, but it would be - "
"Here it is," I said. "Good timing." A man with a carton had appeared on the stoop. As I started to the front the door bell rang, and as I opened the door Wolfe was there beside me. The man, a skinny little guy in pants too big for him and a bright green shirt, spoke. "Nero Wolfe?"
"I’m Nero Wolfe." He was on the sill. "You have my corn?" "Right here." He put the carton down and let go of the cord.

"... But if you insist, very well. My reason for thinking it may contain an explosive is that it was brought by a stranger. My name printed on it was as usual, but naturally such a detail would not be overlooked. There are a number of people in the metropolitan area who have reason to wish me ill, and it would be imprudent - "
"My God, you can lie."
Wolfe tapped the desk with a fingertip. "Mr. Cramer. If you insist on lies you’ll get them. Until I know what’s in that carton. Then we’ll see." He picked up his book, opened to his place, and swiveled to get the light right.
Cramer was stuck. He looked at me, started to say something, and vetoed it. He couldn’t get up and go because he had told the Bomb Squad to call him there, but an inspector couldn’t just sit. He took a cigar from a pocket, looked at it, put it back, arose, came to me, and said, "I’ve got some calls to make." Meaning he wanted my chair, which was a good dodge since it got some action; I had to move. He stayed at the phone nearly half an hour, making four or five calls, none of which sounded important, then got up and went over to the big globe and started studying geography. Ten minutes was enough for that, and he switched to the bookshelves. Back at my desk, leaning back with my legs crossed, my hands clasped behind my head, I noted which books he took out and looked at. Now that I knew who had killed Ken Faber, little things like that were interesting. The one he looked at longest was The Coming Fury, by Bruce Carton. He was still at that when the phone rang. I turned to get it, but by the time I had it to my ear he was there. A man asked for Inspector Cramer and I handed it to him and permitted myself a grin as I saw Wolfe put his book down and reach for his phone. He wasn’t going to take hearsay, even from an inspector.
It was a short conversation; Cramer’s end of it wasn’t more than twenty words. He hung up and went to the red leather chair. "Okay," he growled. "If you had opened that carton they wouldn’t have found all the pieces. You didn’t think it was dynamite, you knew it was. Talk."
==> Wolfe, his lips tight, was breathing deep. "Not me," he said. "It would have been Archie or Fritz, or both of them. And of course my house. The possibility occurred to me, and I came down, barely in time. Three minutes later ... Pfui. <==

 That man is a blackguard." He shook his head, as if getting rid of a fly. "Well. Shortly after ten o’clock last evening I decided how to proceed, and I sent for Saul Panzer. When he came - "
"Who put that dynamite in that carton?"
"I’m telling you. When he came I had him type something on a sheet of paper and told him to drive to Duncan McLeod’s farm this morning and give it to Mr. McLeod. Archie. You have the copy."
I took it from my pocket and went and handed it to Cramer. He kept it, but this is what it said:

"Certainly. And if James Neville Vance comes or calls to say that he expects to be charged with the murder of Mrs. Kirk, if that’s who she was, partly because of the tie he didn’t send me, and he wants to hire you, wouldn’t it be convenient to have the tie? And the envelope and letterhead?"
"I have no expectation of being engaged by Mr. Vance. Nor desire."
"Sure. Because you would have to work. I remarked yesterday that the gross take

 for the first seven months of nineteen sixty-two is nine grand behind nineteen sixty-one. I am performing one of the main functions you pay me for."
==> "Not brilliantly," he said and picked up the book. Merely a childish gesture, since Fritz would enter in eight minutes to announce lunch. I went and opened the safe and stashed my souvenirs on a shelf in the inner compartment. <==

INSPECTOR CRAMER of Homicide South came at ten minutes past six.
I had been functioning all afternoon, I don’t say brilliantly. During lunch, in the dining room across the hall, while listening to Wolfe’s table talk with one ear, I decided to make myself scarce while I considered the matter. There was no sense in getting out on a limb just for the hell of it, and a homicide dick might show any minute, so as we left the table I told Wolfe that since we had no expectations or desires I was going out on some personal chores. He gave me a sharp glance, made a face, and headed for the office. As I was turning to the front the phone rang and I went in and got it. If it was the DA’s office inviting me to call, I would make up my mind on the way downtown.
It was Lon Cohen. He had compliments. "No question about it, Archie," he said, "you’d be worth your weight in blood rubies to any newspaper in town, especially the Gazette. At nine-thirty you phone for dope on James Neville Vance. At twelve-twenty, less than three hours later, a cop finds a body in his house and both you and he are present. Marvelous. Any leg man can find out what happened, but knowing what’s going to happen - you’re one in ten million. What’s on the program for tomorrow? I only want a day at a time."
I was a little short with him because my problem was the program for today.

I GOT HOME well after midnight and before going up two flights to bed hit the refrigerator for leftover lobster and a glass of milk, to remove both hunger and the taste of the excuse for bread and stringy corned beef I had been supplied with at the DA’s office.
Since my connection with their homicide had been short and simple, the twenty seconds I had spent in the Kirk apartment, and my connection with Vance hadn’t been a lot longer, an hour of me should have been more than enough, including typing the statement for me to sign, and it wasn’t until after nine o’clock that I realized, from a question by Assistant DA Mandel, what the idea was. They actually thought that the tie thing might be some kind of dodge that I had been in on, and they were keeping me until they got a report on the stain. So I cooled down and took it easy, got on speaking terms with a dick who was put in a room with me to see that I didn’t jump out a window, got him to produce a deck for some friendly gin, and in two hours managed to lose $4.70. I called time at that point and paid him because he was getting sleepy and it would have been next to impossible to keep him ahead.
I got my money’s worth. Around midnight someone came and called him out, and when he returned ten minutes later and said I was no longer needed I gave him a friendly grin, a good loser, no hard feelings, and said, "So the blood’s the same type, huh?" And he nodded and said, "Yeah, modern science is wonderful."
So, I told myself as I got the lobster out, I got not only my money’s worth but my time’s worth, and by the time I was upstairs and in my pajamas I had decided that if Wolfe wasn’t interested I certainly was, and I was going to find out who had sent me that tie even if I had to take a month’s leave of absence.
==> Except in emergencies I get a full eight hours’ sleep, and that was merely a project, not an emergency, so I didn’t get down for breakfast, which I eat in the kitchen, until after ten o’clock. As I got orange juice from the refrigerator and Fritz started the burner under the cake griddle he asked where I had dined, and I said he knew darned well I hadn’t dined at all, since I had phoned that I was at the DA’s office, and he nodded and said, "These clients in trouble." <==
"Look, Fritz," I told him, "you’re a chef, not a diplomat, so why do you keep that up? You know we’ve had no client for a month and you want to know if we’ve hooked one, so why don’t you just ask? Repeat after me, ‘Have we got a client?’

 Try it."
"Archie." He turned a palm up. "You would have to say yes or no. The way I do it, you can biaiser if you wish."
I had to ask him how to spell it so I could look it up when I went to the office. Sitting, I picked up the Times, and my brow went up when I saw that it had made the front page. Probably on account of Martin Kirk; the Times loves architects as much as it hates disk jockeys and private detectives. It had nothing useful to add to what I had got from Lon, but it mentioned that Mrs. Kirk had been born in Manhattan, Kansas. Any other paper which had dug up that detail would have had a feature piece about born in Manhattan and died in Manhattan.

After three griddle cakes with homemade sausage and one with thyme honey, and two cups of coffee, I made it to the office in time to have the desks dusted, fresh water in the vase, biaiser looked up, and the mail opened, when Wolfe came down from the plant rooms. I waited until the orchids were in the vase and he had sat and glanced through the mail to tell him that it now looked as if someone had sent me a hot piece of evidence in a homicide, and I intended to find out why, of course on my own time, and anyway he wouldn’t be needing me since apparently there was nobody that needed him.

"That’s what I want, your services."
"You want to hire me to investigate this affair?" "Yes. That’s why I’m here."
"And you can pay me without undue strain?" "Yes. I have - Yes. Do you want a check now?"

 thousand dollars will do as a retainer."
==> I had to shut my eyes a second to keep from gawking. That wasn’t only unheard of, it was unbelievable. Taking on a job, which meant that he would have to work, without the usual dodging and stalling - that could be on account of the lag in receipts; but taking a murder suspect for a client offhand, no questions asked but the routine did you kill her and can you pay me, without the faintest notion whether he was guilty or not and how much the cops had on him - that simply wasn’t done, not by anybody, let alone Nero Wolfe. I had to clamp my teeth on my lip to sit and take it. As Kirk got out a checkfold and a pen Wolfe pushed a button on his desk, and in a moment Fritz came. <==
"A tray, please," Wolfe told him. "The madrilène is ready?" "Yes, sir."
"And the pudding?"
"Yes, sir."
"A bowl of each, cheese with water cress, and hot tea."
When Fritz turned and went I would have liked to go along, to tell him that there could be something worse than having no client.

AN HOUR LATER, when the doorbell rang again, Kirk was still there and still the client, and I would still have had to toss a coin to decide where I stood on the question, did he or didn’t he?
Wolfe had of course refused to either talk or listen until the tray had come and gone. Kirk had said he couldn’t eat, but when Wolfe insisted he tried, and if a man can swallow anything he can swallow Fritz’s madrilène with beet juice, and after one spoonful of his lemon sherry pudding with brown sugar sauce there’s no argument. The cheese and water cress were still on the tray when I took it to the kitchen, but the bowls were empty.
When I returned Wolfe had started in. "... so I’ll reverse the process," he was saying. "I’ll tell you and then ask you. Are you sufficiently yourself to

 comprehend?"
"I’m better. I didn’t think I could eat. I’m glad you made me." He didn’t look any better.
Wolfe nodded. "The brain can be hoodwinked but not the stomach. First, then, your statement that you didn’t kill your wife is of course of no weight. I have assumed that you didn’t for reasons of my own, which I reserve. Do you know or suspect who did kill her?"

She looked at Wolfe, saw that he had no comment, and came. When she had crossed the sill I closed the door, which is as soundproof as the wall, went to Wolfe’s desk, and said, "If it blows up in your face you’re not going to blame it on me. I merely called your attention a couple of times to the fact that a fee would be welcome. I didn’t say it was desperate, that you should grab a measly grand from a character who is probably going to be tagged for the big one. And now when he says he is going to see Vance, to handle the tie question on his own - and the tie was sent to me, not you - you not only don’t veto it, you don’t even tell me to go and sit in. Also she’s going there too, that’s obvious, and you merely tell her to phone you later. I admit you’re a genius, but when you took his check you couldn’t possibly have had the faintest idea whether he was guilty or not, and even now you don’t know the score. They may have him absolutely wrapped up. The tie was mailed to me and I gave it to Cramer, and I’m asking, not respectfully."
He nodded. "Well said. A good speech." "Thank you. And?"
"I didn’t tell you to go because it’s lunchtime. Also I doubt if you would get anything useful. Naturally I’ll have to see Mr. Vance - and Mr. Fougere. As for desperation, when I took Mr. Kirk’s check I knew it was extremely improbable that he had killed his wife, and I - "
"How?"
He shook his head. "You call me to account? You know everything that I know; ponder it yourself. If instead of lunch you choose to be present at a futile conversation, do so by all means. I will not be hectored into an explanation you shouldn’t need."
==> Fritz entered to announce lunch, saw what the atmosphere was, and stood. I went and opened the door to the front room, passed through, and told Rita, "All right, Mrs. Fougere. I’m going along." <==

WHEN YOU’RE GOOD and sore at someone it’s simple. You cuss him out, to his face if he’s available and privately if he isn’t, and you take steps if and as you can. When you’re sore at yourself it’s even simpler; the subject is right there and can’t skip. But when you’re sore at yourself and someone else at the same time you’re in a fix. If you try to concentrate on one the other one horns in and gets you off balance, and that was the state I was in as I stood aside in the vestibule of Two-nineteen Horn Street while Rita Fougere used her key on the door. In the taxi on the way down I had told her about the necktie problem. She might as well get it from me as later from Kirk, and she might as well understand why Kirk wanted to see Vance.

 "Are you arresting me?"
"If you prefer it that way I can. Material witness. Or if you balk I’ll phone for a warrant and keep you company till it comes, maybe an hour. With Goodwin here I’ve got to toe the line. He’s hell on wheels, Goodwin is."
Kirk made it to his feet. "All right," he mumbled. He had been without sleep for thirty hours and maybe more. Rita Fougere aimed those eyes at me.
I bowed out. Being hell on wheels is fine and dandy if you have anywhere to steer for, but I hadn’t. I went and opened the door and on out, took the elevator down, exchanged no greeting with the driver of the police car out front, though we had met, walked till I found a taxi, and told the hackie 618 West 35th Street; and when he said that was Nero Wolfe’s house I actually said such is fame. That’s the shape I was in.
==> Wolfe was at table in the dining room, putting a gob of his favorite cheese on a wafer. When I entered he looked up and said politely, "Fritz is keeping the kidneys warm." <==
I stopped three steps in. "Many thanks," I said even more politely. "You were right as usual; the conversation was futile. They had a tail on Kirk, here and to the hotel and on to Horn Street. When Purley Stebbins arrived at Vance’s apartment he knew Kirk was there and he wasn’t surprised to see me. He had come for your client and took him. They have found the typewriter that addressed that envelope to me and the message. It belonged to Kirk, but on July nineteenth he traded it in on another one. Since you don’t talk business at meals, I’ll eat in the kitchen."
I wheeled, hell on wheels, and went to the kitchen.
87
NEARLY FOUR HOURS LATER, at six o’clock, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Fougere were in the office, waiting for Wolfe to come down from the plant rooms - she in the red leather chair and he in one of the yellow ones in front of Wolfe’s desk. To my surprise he had two marks, a red slightly puffed nose and a little bruise under his left eye. I hadn’t thought Kirk had shown that much power, but of course with bare knuckles it doesn’t take much.

Cramer uttered a word about the same flavor as the one Fougere had used, but of

course there was no lady present. He followed it up. "I suppose I’d send it to the Commissioner so he could frame it?" He flattened his palms on the chair arms. "Look, Wolfe. I know you. I know you’ve got something. I admit your four points taken together add up. I’ll take your word that you won’t send Goodwin to break and enter. I know I can’t pry any more out of you even if it wasn’t time for you to eat, and anyway I eat too. But you say I’m to keep Vance until I hear from you or Goodwin, and that might mean all night, and he’s not just some bum. Nothing doing. Make it tomorrow morning, say ten o’clock, and limit it to six hours if I don’t hear from you or Goodwin, and I’ll buy it."
Wolfe grinned. "That’s better anyway. I was rushing it. I said send a man to get him."
"I heard you."
==> "Very well." Wolfe turned. "Archie. Mr. Cramer and I need a few minutes to make sure of details. Tell Fritz. And use the phone in the kitchen to get Mrs. Fougere. I must see her this evening. Also get Saul and Fred and Orrie. I want them either this evening or at eight in the morning." <==
I rose. "Does it matter which?" "No."
I beat it to the kitchen.
98
IF YOU EVER NEED an operative and only the best will do, get Saul Panzer if you can. If Saul isn’t available, get Fred Durkin or Orrie Cather. That was the trio who entered James Neville Vance’s apartment with me at a quarter past ten Thursday morning.
What made the entry legal was that when I rang the bells, both downstairs and upstairs, the doors were opened from the inside. Who opened them was Rita Fougere. Upstairs she held it open until we were in and then closed it. I preferred not to touch the door - not that it mattered, but I like things neat.

"Me," I said. "We’ll be there in less than half an hour. Saul found the tie. It was in a piano score in a cabinet in the studio. I just found Exhibit X. I can tell you what he did. After he killed her he cut off a lock of her hair with blood on it, plenty of blood, and took it for a keepsake. After the blood was dry he put it inside one of his gloves in a drawer, which is where I found it. That has to be it. You may not believe it till you see it, but you will then."
"Indeed." A pause. "Satisfactory. Very satisfactory. Bring the glove."
"Certainly. A suggestion - or call it a request. Tell Cramer to have him there at a quarter after four, or half past. We’re starving, including Mrs. Fougere, and we

 need time - "
==> "You know my schedule. I’ll tell Mr. Cramer six o’clock. Fritz will - " <==
"No." I was emphatic. "For once you’ll have to skip it. The six hours is up at four o’clock, and if you put it off until six Cramer may let him go home, with or without an escort, and he might find that both the tie and the keepsake are gone. Would that be satisfactory?"
Silence. "No." More silence. "Confound it." Still more. "Very well. Fritz will have something ready."
"Better make it half past and - " He had hung up.

INSPECTOR CRAMER SETTLED BACK in the red leather chair, narrowed his eyes at Wolfe, and rasped, "I’ve told Mr. Vance that this won’t be on any official record and he can answer your questions or not as he pleases."

He wouldn’t have settled back if he had been the only city employee present, since he knew that almost certainly some fur was going to fly. Sergeant Purley Stebbins was there at his right on a chair against the wall. Purley never sits with his back to anyone, even his superior officer, if he can help it. James Neville Vance was on a chair facing Wolfe’s desk, between Cramer and me. Rita Fougere was on the couch at the left of my desk, and Saul and Fred and Orrie were grouped over by the big globe.
"There won’t be many questions," Wolfe told Cramer. "Nothing remains to be satisfied but my curiosity on a point or two." His head turned. "Mr. Vance, only you can satisfy it." To me: "Archie?"

Yeah. We're really going to tackle it?" "You are."
"You leave it to me?"
"No. We'll discuss it later."
"There isn't much to discuss. No matter what we dig up about her, he'll probably -"
==> There were footsteps in the hall, and Fritz was at the door to announce dinner. Wolfe put the book down, stroked it with his fingertips, and rose. <==

That was Monday, February 24. Forty-two hours later, at one o'clock Wednesday, I had lunch with Susan Brooke at Lily Rowan's penthouse on 63rd Street between Madison and Park.
In the random assortment of facts Whipple had supplied there had been nothing to bite on. She had graduated from Radcliffe four or five years ago, and not long after had come to New York. She was living with her married brother, an electronics engineer, in his Park Avenue apartment, and so was her mother. They were from Wisconsin - Racine, Whipple thought, but wasn't sure. He didn't actually know that she was financially independent; he had assumed it, because for more than two years she had been working for the ROCC as a volunteer, no pay, and she had made cash contributions amounting to $2350. Not office work; she made contacts and arranged fund-raising parties and meetings.
That was about all Whipple knew, except for a couple of dozen useless little details and a few even more useless guesses.
The Lily Rowan idea was of course mine, since she was my friend, not Wolfe's. My first suggestion, Monday evening after dinner, was that I would phone the ROCC office, speak with the executive director, Thomas Henchy, and tell him that Wolfe was considering making a substantial contribution, that he would like to discuss it, and that in my opinion the best person to see him would be Miss

She was living with her married brother, an electronics engineer, in his Park Avenue apartment, and so was her mother. They were from Wisconsin - Racine, Whipple thought, but wasn't sure. He didn't actually know that she was financially independent; he had assumed it, because for more than two years she had been working for the ROCC as a volunteer, no pay, and she had made cash contributions amounting to $2350. Not office work; she made contacts and arranged fund-raising parties and meetings.
That was about all Whipple knew, except for a couple of dozen useless little details and a few even more useless guesses.
The Lily Rowan idea was of course mine, since she was my friend, not Wolfe's. My first suggestion, Monday evening after dinner, was that I would phone the ROCC office, speak with the executive director, Thomas Henchy, and tell him that Wolfe was considering making a substantial contribution, that he would like to discuss it, and that in my opinion the best person to see him would be Miss

==>  Susan Brooke because I had heard that she made a good impression with men. That was vetoed by Wolfe on the ground (a) that he would feel committed to a substantial contribution, at least a grand, and (b) that with an attractive young woman I would get farther sooner if he wasn't present. Of course the real ground was that she was a woman. There are many things he likes about the old brownstone on West 35th Street, which he owns: the furniture and rugs and books and soundproofing; the plant rooms on the roof; Fritz Brenner, the chef; the big kitchen; Theodore Horstmann, the orchid nurse; and me, the man and the muscle. But what he likes best is that there is no woman in it, and it would suit him fine if one never crossed the doorsill. <==
So I suggested Lily Rowan, to whom a grand is peanuts, and that was satisfactory. When I rang her, that evening, she said she didn't like to discuss dirty work on the phone so I had better come in person, and I went, and got back to 35th Street and to bed at a quarter past two. Since I take a full eight hours short of murder, I didn't get to the office Tuesday morning until after Wolfe had come down from his two hours in the plant rooms - nine to eleven. Around noon Lily phoned. Miss Brooke would be there tomorrow for lunch at one o'clock, and I might come earlier for more briefing.
The two miles crosstown and up to 63rd Street is one of my favorite walks, but that Wednesday it took plenty of man and muscle. When it's twenty above and at every corner a snowy blast that has been practicing ever since it left Hudson Bay lowers your chin and clamps your mouth shut and bends you nearly double, you have to grit your teeth to go on by all the handy doors to shops and bars and hotel lobbies. When I finally made it, shook the snow off of my coat and hat under the canopy and in the lobby, took the elevator and left it at the top and pushed the button, and Lily opened the door, I said, "The nearest bed."
She raised a brow, a trick I taught her. "Try next door," she said. She let me by and shut the door. "You didn't walk!"
"Sure. You could call it walking." I put my hat and coat in the closet. "If they walked up Everest, I walked here."
We linked arms and entered the living room, with its 19-by-34 Kashan rug, a garden pattern in seven colors, its Renoir and Manet and Cezanne, its off-white piano, and its glass doors to the terrace, where the wind was giving the snow a big play. When we sat she poked her feet out, the shins parallel, and muttered, "Antelope legs."

"Not me. I merely said a man." "Name one."
"Nero Wolfe."

Ha. What will you bet I couldn't?"
"Not a dime. I know him, but I know you too. No bet."
==> "You would have to move out." She had a look in her eye, I would say the look of a tiger stalking a herd of deer if I had ever seen a tiger stalk deer. "We would fire Fritz, and of course Theodore. He would read aloud to me. We would ditch the orchids and take out the partitions in the plant rooms and have dancing parties, and you wouldn't be invited. For lunch we would have peanutbutter-and- jelly sandwiches, and - " <==
I clapped a palm over her mouth with my other hand at the back of her head. With no effort to break away, she tried to bite. I said, "When you're ready to discuss the subject, shut your right eye."
She shut her right eye, and I took my hands away. "Well?" "I stand pat," she said. "She's fascinating."
"To you. It's perfectly simple. She's a status-seeker. She wants to be the mayor's wife."
"Uhuh. I always laugh at your cracks to make you secure and happy and comfortable, but may I skip that one? You're trying to get something on her that will keep that colored man from marrying her. Right?"
"That's the idea."

I swallowed with nothing to swallow. I started, "Where was - " and stopped. I swallowed again. "I'll leave - "
"When will you get here?"
"How do I know? Noon, one o'clock." "Very well." He hung up.
I permitted myself to sit on the edge of the bed for ten seconds. Then I got erect, dressed, packed the bag, took the elevator down and checked out, walked to the parking lot and got the car, and headed for Chicago. I would get breakfast at the airport.

==> It wasn't noon, and it wasn't one o'clock, when I used my key on the door of the old brownstone on West 35th Street. It was five minutes to two. The plane had floated around above a fog bank for half an hour before landing at Idlewild - I mean Kennedy International Airport. I put my bag down and was taking my coat off when Fritz appeared at the end of the hall, from the kitchen, and came. <==
"Grace a Dieu," he said. "He called the airport. You know how he is about machines. I've kept it hot. Shad roe, fines herbes, no parsley."
"I can use it. But I - "

A roar came. "Archie!"
I went to the open door to the dining room, which is across the hall from the office. At the table, Wolfe was putting cheese on a wafer.

"I can use it. But I - "

A roar came. "Archie!"
I went to the open door to the dining room, which is across the hall from the office. At the table, Wolfe was putting cheese on a wafer.
"Nice day," I said. "You don't want to smell the herbs again so I'll eat in the kitchen with the Times. The one on the plane was the early edition."
==> We get two copies of the Times, one for Wolfe, who has a tray breakfast in his room, and one for me. I proceeded to the kitchen, and there was my Times, propped on the rack, on the little table where I always eat breakfast. Even when I'm away for a week on some errand Fritz probably puts it there every morning. He would. I sat and got it and looked for the headline, but in a moment was interrupted by Fritz with the platter and a hot plate. I helped myself and took a bite of the roe and a piece of crusty roll dabbed in the sauce, which is one of Fritz's best when he leaves the parsley out. <==
The details were about as scanty as in the early edition. Susan Brooke's corpse had been found shortly before nine o'clock Monday evening in a room on the third floor of a building on 128th Street, a walk-up of course, by a man named Dunbar Whipple, who was on the staff of the Rights of Citizens Committee. Her skull had been crushed by repeated blows. I already knew that much. Also I already knew what the late city edition added: that Susan Brooke had been a volunteer worker for the ROCC, and she had lived with her widowed mother in a Park Avenue apartment; and that Dunbar Whipple was twenty-three years old and was the son of Paul Whipple, an assistant professor of anthropology at Columbia University. One thing I had not actually known but could have guessed if I had put my mind on it: the police and the district attorney's office had started an investigation.
When the roe and sauce and rolls were where they belonged, and some salad, I refilled my coffee cup and took it to the office. Wolfe was at his desk, tapping his nose with a pencil, scowling at a crossword puzzle. I went to my desk, sat, and sipped coffee. After a while he switched the scowl to me, realized I hadn't earned it, and erased it.
"Confound it," he said, "it's preposterous and insulting that I might lose your services and talents merely through the whim of a mechanism. How high up were you at noon?"
"Oh, four miles. I know. You regard anything and everything beyond your

 barked at you, "What did you do, what did you do," I thought to myself, so he didn't kill her. If he had killed her of course he would be putting on an act, but that act was just too good. Only a genius could be that good, and I've never seen any genius besides you. Then when he told me I knew who killed her. Then when he apologized to you. Do I have to go on?"
"No. It was manifest. He couldn't possibly have been dissembling. You're aware that the report is required not only for Mr. Cramer. I must have it."
"Sure. Proceeding as usual. Giving me a long, mean, extremely difficult job." I turned and got at the paper and carbons.

It took eleven hours plus, four hours Thursday evening and most of Friday. Thirty-two pages and the affidavit. That may seem slow, but for most of it I had no notes. At a quarter past four Friday afternoon I put it in an envelope with a label addressed to Inspector Cramer, took it to a notary public on Eighth Avenue to have the affidavit made official, and then, in a taxi, to Homicide South on 20th Street. I also took a taxi back. It was a nice sunny winter day for a walk, but the Gazette was on the stands and there was an item in it which I wanted to enjoy at leisure.
==> There had been interruptions. Whipple had phoned late Thursday evening to say that Oster, the lawyer, had been glad to hear that he would have Nero Wolfe's help and had approved on behalf of his client. At eight-thirty Friday morning, already at my desk, I was buzzed by Wolfe on the house phone from his room and instructed to call Lon Cohen and tell him that if he cared to send a reporter to 35th Street we would have an item that might be printable; and furthermore I was told to send the reporter up to the plant rooms if he came between nine and eleven. He came a little after ten, and Fritz took him up in the elevator. That wasn't unprecedented but it was out of the ordinary. It was too bad I couldn't tell Dunbar Whipple that, in the interest of a Negro, Wolfe was making an exception he had rarely made in the interest of any white man. I wondered then, and I still do, whether words had anything to do with it, knowing how he is about words. <==

s he had told me, discussing words one evening at the dinner table, negro means black in Spanish and nero means black in Italian. And he had been born in Montenegro, Black Mountain. Maybe something buried in him but not dead, in his cesspool and/or garden.
Of the other phone calls I need to report only one, shortly after lunch, from Oster, when it was arranged that he and Whipple would come at six o'clock for a conference.
In the cab returning from 20th Street I read the item three times. It was on page 3, with the headline: NERO WOLFE SITS IN. Not bad. About anyone else it would probably have been STEPS IN.
God knows he sits. It went:

He announced today that he has been engaged by Harold R. Oster, attorney for Dunbar Whipple, who has been charged with the murder (see page 1), to investigate certain aspects of the affair.
According to the record, not one of Wolfe's clients has ever been convicted of murder.
Asked this morning by a Gazette reporter if he didn't feel that in this case he was endangering his record, he replied with a flat no. He said that he has good reason to believe that Dunbar Whipple is innocent, and he is confident that, working with Oster, he will be able to procure evidence that will clear him.
He declined to disclose his reasons for believing that Whipple is innocent or the nature of the evidence he expects to get. But for some people the mere fact that he is willing to have it known publicly that he is engaged in the defense of Whipple will be significant. Others will say that there is always a first time.
No picture of the well-known detective, though there were a dozen shots of him in the Gazette morgue. I'd have to write a letter to the editor.
==> When I entered the old brownstone and went to the office I noticed something. The Gazette is delivered there every day around five o'clock, and it wasn't on my desk, and I wanted the extra copy. I went to the kitchen and asked Fritz if he had it, and he said no, Wolfe had phoned down from the plant rooms to bring it up. More out of the ordinary. He likes to see his name in the paper as well as you do, <==

ut he always waits until he comes down to the office. As I got the milk from the refrigerator and poured a glass I was thinking that if you stick around long enough you'll see everything.
Whipple and Oster arrived early. One of the many Wolfe-made rules in that house is that when a client and his lawyer are both present the client gets the red leather chair, but that time it wasn't followed. Oster shot a glance around and went straight to it. He was tall and broad, with skin the color of dark honey, the kind Wolfe prefers - I mean honey - and he moved like a man who is in charge and intends to stay in charge. I was curious to see what would happen if Wolfe tried to shift him to the yellow chair.
He didn't bother. The sound came of the elevator jolting to a stop, and he entered. The Gazette was in his hand. He nodded left and right and headed between them for his desk, but Oster was up with a hand out. Wolfe halted, shook his head, said distinctly, "My wrist," and went to his chair.
Oster sat down and asked, "Hurt your wrist?"

What?"
"I suggest that Mr. Whipple's extravagance should be ignored. Let's put it that the legal defense of Dunbar Whipple is in your hands, and the search for evidence to support that defense is in my hands. I knew we would clash, and we have. There are no casualties. Oblige me by sitting down. Naturally I expected, and expect, you to be present at the conference tomorrow evening. If you wish to object to anything I say or do, you have a tongue. You have indeed. I don't wonder that you tried to drum me out; I'm difficult, though not really impossible. If you wish to debate it with Mr. Whipple, you can do so later." He looked at the clock. "No doubt you have information for me, and suggestions, and in less than half an hour it will be dinnertime. If you and Mr. Whipple will dine with us, we'll have the evening for it. Wild duck with Vatel sauce - wine vinegar, egg yolk, tomato paste, butter, cream, salt and pepper, shallots, tarragon, chervil, and peppercorns. Is any of those distasteful to you?"
Oster said no.
"To you, Mr. Whipple?" Whipple said no.
==> "Tell Fritz, Archie." <==
I got up and went to the kitchen. It was a good thing neither of them had said yes, for Fritz was well along with the sauce, as Wolfe had known he would be. He didn't welcome my news.
Not that he didn't like guests at meals, but he thought there wouldn't be enough duck. I told him it would do Wolfe good to go easy for a change, returned to the office, and found that Oster was back in the red leather chair, evidently on speaking terms, and Wolfe had a pen and pad of paper, taking notes. I interrupted to ask about drinks, got orders for a martini and a vodka on the rocks, and went to the kitchen to fill them.
Only two kinds of guests ever dine at that table: (a) men for whom Wolfe has personal feelings - there are eight altogether, and only two of them live in or near New York - and (b) people who are involved in his current problem. With both kinds he makes a point of steering the table talk to subjects that he thinks the guests will be interested in; for him, as he once remarked, a guest is a jewel on

cushion of hospitality - a little fancy maybe, but a fine sentiment. As Fritz was serving the mussels I was wondering what it would be for those two. It was William Shakespeare. After the skimpy portions of mussels, in white wine with creamed butter and flour, had been commented on, Wolfe asked them if they had read the book by Rowse. They hadn't. But they were interested in Shakespeare? Oh, yes. Not many lawyers or professors would dare to say no. Of course they were familiar with Othello? They were. I cocked an eye at Wolfe. Surely it wasn't very tactful, with those dinner guests to deliberately drag Othello in.

He swallowed his last bite of mussel. "There's an interesting point," he said. "A question. If the facts were established as they are presented in the play, could Iago, today in the State of New York, be legally charged with murder as an accessory, and be successfully prosecuted?"

I had to hand it to him. Unquestionably Othello concerned a subject in which they were interested, and putting the spot on Iago and a question of law made it discussable. They discussed it up one side and down the other. By the time the duck and trimmings had been disposed of, and Fritz had brought the fig souflle, it looked to me as if Iago was on the ropes.
Fritz answers the doorbell during meals, so when it rang as I started on my souflle I stayed put. It would be Cramer. Having read the report, he had come with questions, and they were welcome, because that was better than being invited to the DA's office. But it wasn't Cramer. The sound of voices came from the hall, Fritz's and another, and then another, not recognized. They stopped. There was no use trying to hear a door closing; not only does Fritz close doors quietly, but also Oster was talking. Fritz appeared, crossed the sill, and told Wolfe, "Two men and a woman, sir." Formerly he would have said two gentlemen and a lady, but Wolfe had stopped that. He went on, "Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Brooke and Mr. Peter Vaughn. In the front room. I told them I thought you were engaged for the evening."
Wolfe looked at me. I nodded, "Her brother." He told Fritz he could bring the cheese and we would have coffee there instead of in the office, and forked a bite of souffle.
Oster asked, "Susan's brother?" and I said yes. He asked Wolfe, "You weren't expecting him?"

Surely it wasn't very tactful, with those dinner guests to deliberately drag Othello in.
He swallowed his last bite of mussel. "There's an interesting point," he said. "A question. If the facts were established as they are presented in the play, could Iago, today in the State of New York, be legally charged with murder as an accessory, and be successfully prosecuted?"
I had to hand it to him. Unquestionably Othello concerned a subject in which they were interested, and putting the spot on Iago and a question of law made it discussable. They discussed it up one side and down the other. By the time the duck and trimmings had been disposed of, and Fritz had brought the fig souflle, it looked to me as if Iago was on the ropes.
Fritz answers the doorbell during meals, so when it rang as I started on my souflle I stayed put. It would be Cramer. Having read the report, he had come with questions, and they were welcome, because that was better than being invited to the DA's office. But it wasn't Cramer. The sound of voices came from the hall, Fritz's and another, and then another, not recognized. They stopped. There was no use trying to hear a door closing; not only does Fritz close doors quietly, but also Oster was talking. Fritz appeared, crossed the sill, and told Wolfe, "Two men and a woman, sir." Formerly he would have said two gentlemen and a lady, but Wolfe had stopped that. He went on, "Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Brooke and Mr. Peter Vaughn. In the front room. I told them I thought you were engaged for the evening."
==> Wolfe looked at me. I nodded, "Her brother." He told Fritz he could bring the cheese and we would have coffee there instead of in the office, and forked a bite of souffle. <==
Oster asked, "Susan's brother?" and I said yes. He asked Wolfe, "You weren't expecting him?"
Wolfe swallowed the bite. "Not him specifically. I was rather expecting

 someone, this evening or tomorrow. The hook I baited." In the office he would have been smug, but not with guests, at the table. "I need another hour or so with you and Mr. Whipple, but it will have to wait. Perhaps Mr. Goodwin could call at your office in the morning?"
"I want to sit in on this. With these people."

"No, sir. We would probably start bickering in front of them. I'll report it to you - at my discretion."
==> Fritz came with the cheese. <==

I stood in the alcove at the rear end of the hall, looking through the hole in the wall.
On the alcove side it's just a hole, a rectangle with a sliding panel. On the office side it's covered by a picture of a waterfall which you can see through from the alcove. I was seeing through, for a preview of the two men and a woman whom Fritz had conducted to the office after Whipple and Oster had left. Wolfe, standing beside me, had already looked. Kenneth Brooke, in the red leather chair, had his head turned to face the other two, talking with them. He was chunky and solid, not slim like his sister. His wife, in the chair Paul Whipple had occupied before dinner, was a full-sized, positive blonde. I mean positive not as opposed to negative, but as opposed to vague. The other man, Peter Vaughn, of whom I had never heard, in a chair Fritz had moved up, was long and lanky, with a narrow bony face. Wolfe and I had been there, looking and listening, for six or seven minutes, but the listening hadn't helped any. They were discussing a picture on the wall back of Wolfe's desk, not the waterfall. Vaughn thought it was an unsigned Van Gogh, which it wasn't. It had been painted by a man named McIntyre whom Wolfe had once got out of a scrape.
Wolfe wiggled a finger, and I slid the noiseless panel shut. He looked a question at me, had I ever seen any of them? I shook my head, and he led the way to the office. Entering, he detoured around Brooke to his desk, and I passed behind the other two to mine. Before he sat he spoke. "I'm sorry you had to wait. Usually I see callers only by appointment, but I make exceptions. You are Susan Brooke's

"That piece in the Gazette," Mrs. Brooke said. She talked positive too. "We think you're right. We know you're right!"

When Wolfe came down from the plant rooms at six o'clock he picked it up, read it twice, scowled at it for two minutes, put it in a drawer, and picked up his current book. Not Rowse on Shakespeare; The Minister and the Choir Singer, by a lawyer named Kunstler. I had read it and recommended it. At dinner we discussed it and agreed that the New York Police Department and district attorney's office had never made such an awful mess of a case and never would.
The evening didn't start off any too well. When four or more are coming for an after-dinner session I equip a portable bar in the kitchen and wheel it into the office, and it was there, by the bookshelves to the left of the safe, when the first one arrived; but twenty minutes later, when they had all come and been seated, and Wolfe entered, I had made no sales. That was remarkable. Out of eight people, at nine o'clock in the evening, you would expect at least two or three to be thirsty enough or bushed enough to want a drink, but they all said no. It couldn't have been because of my manners, offering to serve people of an inferior race. First, two of them were white, and second, when I consider myself

 superior to anyone, as I frequently do, I need a better reason than his skin.
The seating was segregated, not by color but by sex. Wolfe had told me to put Whipple, the client, in the red leather chair, and since he had arrived before Oster there had been no clash.
==> In the front row of yellow chairs Oster was at the far end from me, then Henchy, Ewing, public relations, and Faison, fund-raising. In the back row were Rae Kallman, Maud Jordan, and Beth Tiger. It was my first sight of the Misses Kallman and Tiger. Kallman, who had more lipstick than necessary on her full lips, would probably be plump in a few years, but now she was just nice and curvy. Tiger was one of those specimens who cannot be properly introduced by details. I'll mention that her skin was about the color of an old solid-gold bowl Wolfe has in his room which he won't allow Fritz to clean, that - if she had been Cleopatra instead of what's-her-name I wouldn't have missed that movie, and that I had a problem with my eyes all evening, since with a group there I am supposed to watch expressions and movements. It was especially difficult because Miss Tiger, nearest me in the back row, was at an angle to my right. My mistake. <==
It was ten past nine when I buzzed the kitchen on the house phone to tell Wolfe they were all there, and in a minute he entered, circled around Whipple to his desk, and stood while I pronounced names. To each one he nodded, his usual eighth-of-an-inch nod, then turned to me and demanded, "The refreshments, Archie?"
"Offered," I said, "and declined."
"Indeed. Beer for me, please." As I rose he turned to the client. "Mr. Whipple, that evening at Upshur Pavilion you took ginger ale."
Whipple's eyes widened. "You remember that?"
"Certainly. But the other day you had a martini. Will it be ginger ale now? I'm

I slid the panel shut, no noise, and Wolfe and I went to the kitchen. When the door had swung shut he grunted and said, "Satisfactory."
"Awful corny," I said, "and awful tough. Why she didn't scream or throw something or jump up and run I don't know. I wish I understood women."
"Pfui. Need you report?"
==> "No. I followed instructions and she reacted more or less as expected. What I need after that is a drink, and I have six or seven minutes." I went to a cupboard for a bottle of Big Sandy and to a shelf for a glass, poured, and took a healthy sip. Fritz, who was at the sink sprinkling watercress, said, 'There's milk in the refrigerator." <==
"Not when I've just watched three grown men bully a poor little woman." I took a sip.
"She is not little and she may be a murderer."
"Murderess. You mustn't call a female Jew a Jewess, and you mustn't call a female Negro a
Negress, but it's okay to call a female murderer a murderess." I took a sip. "Why?" he demanded.
"Because they resent it. That's another civil right, resenting things. I resent being called a private eye or a hawkshaw, so don't do it." I looked at my watch, took a sip, put the glass on the big table, and told Wolf; "Time's up unless you want to stretch it."

"Go to hell," I said emphatically and turned to the typewriter and banged.
I don't know how long he would have stalled on that one - a day or a week or forever. At dinner he started on automation. He has always been anti-machine, and on automation his position was that it would soon make life an absurdity. It

already bad enough; on a cold and windy March day he was eating his evening meal in comfortable warmth, and he had no personal connection whatever with the production of the warmth. The check that paid the oil bill was connected, but he wasn't. Soon, with automation, no one would have any connection with the processes and phenomena that make it possible to stay alive. We would all be parasites, living not on some other living organisms but on machines, arrived at the ultimate ignominy. I tried to put up a stiff argument, but he knows more words. We were still at it when we got up to cross to the office for coffee, and were in the hail when the doorbell rang.
It was Paul Whipple. Wolfe, seeing him through the one-way glass, let out a growl; he hadn't finished with automation. But it was the client, and besides, since we had no notion of what to do next, we had better see if he had.
==> No. All he had was a question. Being polite, he didn't ask it until Fritz had brought the coffee, and Wolfe had poured and I had passed, and he had taken a couple of sips. The steam dimmed his black-rimmed cheaters, and he got out a handkerchief to wipe them. <==
"My two friends told me what happened," he said. "They said you didn't tell them not to."
Wolfe was trying to look as if he didn't mind having unexpected company and not succeeding. "I told them they could tell you but no one else."
"They won't. You said there might be a development that would show promise. Did it?"
"Yes and no." Wolfe drank, put his cup down, and took a deep breath. "Mr. Whipple. I intended to reserve this, and if you had telephoned I would have. But you troubled to come, and you have a right to your question. Your son could be out tomorrow. Perhaps on bail, but at liberty."
The cheaters dropped to the floor, but the rug is soft. "My God," he said, just loud enough to hear. "I knew it. I knew you could do it."

"Oh, ask a few questions. I wish I hadn't mentioned it. It's probably nothing. I want to say I'm damned grateful to you and Wolfe, not telling the police. I was pretty sure you hadn't; they would have been at me. I'm damned grateful."
He hung up, and I was grateful to him. He had given me something to nibble at. Was there any chance he was going to produce an item we could work on, and if so, what would it be? It would have to be about Dolly Brooke, since she and Kenneth were his only connection, but it wouldn't be about the item he had just supplied, that Dolly could imitate Susan's voice, since he had asked why I asked. Yet it might. He might have asked why I asked to see if I knew something he knew or suspected. I should have hung on. I rang him. First Heron Manhattan; he hadn't been in today. Then his home; he had just gone out and they didn't know where.
When Wolfe came down from the plant rooms I reported. He listened with his eyes open, showing that he was hearing nothing that called for concentration. It was obvious that he had decided, for some reason too subtle for me to appreciate, possibly because he didn't want to see her again if he could avoid it, that Dolly Brooke wasn't it. When I suggested that it wouldn't hurt to try to find Vaughn and pry it out of him, he said pfui, Mr. Vaughn was manifestly an ass, since he hadn't even had enough gumption to slough his illusion about Miss Brooke. That was a fitting end to the day. I had enough gumption to go up to my room, ring Lucy Valdon, and invite her to dine at Rusterman's. She suggested that we eat at her house instead. Sometimes that suggestion is welcome, and it was then. It was nice and quiet there and we could laugh louder and longer. I certainly needed someone to laugh with. If Vaughn phoned, Wolfe could tell him

 where to get me. I stripped and got under the shower.
==> My morning fog begins to let little streaks of light through as I sip orange juice, and with my second cup of coffee it's all clear, so when I go to the office around nine-thirty I'm set for the day. But there are exceptions, and that Thursday morning was one. First, it was ten-thirty instead of nine-thirty. Second, I had got home at three o'clock and had had two hours' less sleep than my regulation eight. Third, there was nothing to be set for. If there had been any word from Peter Vaughn it hadn't been worth mentioning, since there had been no note on my desk when I got home. Evidently it was going to be more of the same. I had a notion to go up and get Wolfe's toothbrush and put it on his desk, on top of the mail, but that would only make it worse. I would go for a walk and not be there when he came down. That appealed to me. My watch said 10:52. I went to the kitchen and told Fritz, and to the rack in the hall for my coat, and as I was reaching for it some object dimmed the light from the glass in the door, and I turned. The object was Inspector Cramer. Good. Anything and anybody was welcome, even him, even if he had somehow learned about Dolly Brooke and intended to take us for obstructing justice. I opened the door as he started his hand for the button, and said, "Greetings. I was standing here waiting for you." <==
No comment. He was not only out of sorts, he was out of words. He took his coat off and put it on the bench, dropped his hat on it, marched to the office, looked at his watch, and stood facing the door to the hall. Going to my desk, I had a splendid view of his broad burly shoulders and his king-size fanny, motionless for a good three minutes until Wolfe entered, stopped two steps in, and glared. Cramer wheeled and went to the red leather chair. Wolfe switched the glare to me, and as he went to his desk I said, "There wasn't time to buzz you, he just came." He put a raceme of Vanda suavis in the vase, sat, and started looking through the mail, no hurry.
"Take your time," Cramer said, icy. "Take my time. We've got all day. You're going to tell me every word anyone has said in this room, including you and Goodwin, about the murder of Susan Brooke. Start with Peter Vaughn. How often has he been here, and when, and what was said?"
So it was Dolly Brooke. Her statement, all three copies, was in the safe. A safe is safer than a locked drawer.
Wolfe pushed the mail aside and swiveled. "This is extraordinary," he said, not a

I looked at it for five seconds. "What else?" "Nothing ponderable."
"Okay." I stood up. "I'm taking a leave of absence without pay. Two hours or two days, I don't know."

He nodded. "With luck it will be two hours. Your time would be better spent on Mr. Vaughn, even with Mr. Cramer's legion underfoot." He reached for the little stack of mail.
I blew.
==> I never, in these reports, skimp any step that counts, forward or backward. If I score a point, or if I get my nose pushed in, I like to cover it. But it would be a waste of time and space to tell you, for instance, how the Park Avenue hallman reacted to the fact that this time I could talk, or how Dolly Brooke took the news, news to her, that Peter Vaughn was dead. What matters is that it wasn't a step in either direction, except for me personally, since Wolfe had already crossed her off. In less than two hours I got the kind of alibi you do get sometimes, the kind you file under finished business. At seven-forty Wednesday evening Kenneth and Dolly Brooke had sat down to dinner at the table of another couple in the same apartment house; a little before nine two other couples had joined them for an evening of bridge; and they had quit around one o'clock. I checked it with all three of the women, two in person and one on the phone, and with two of the men. When I got back to the old brownstone, Wolfe was in the dining room, halfway through lunch, and one glance at my face told him how it stood. I took my seat, and Fritz came, and I helped myself to a healthy portion of broiled shad that had been marinated in oil and lemon juice seasoned with bay leaf, thyme, and oregano, and three ladles of pureed sorrel. I took only three ladles because at bedtime I would go to the kitchen, heat the leftover sorrel, spread it on a couple of slices of Fritz's bread, and sprinkle it with nutmeg. Serve with a glass of milk. Have a spoon handy to salvage the puree that dribbles onto the plate when you bite. <==
When we went to the office neither of us mentioned Dolly Brooke. I merely said, as I sat, "I'll deduct twenty-two dollars for the two hours."
He grunted. "I prefer not to share the cost of this performance. I'm paying a debt." He flipped a hand to dismiss it. "Presumably Mr. Vaughn telephoned from his home."
"Only presumably. When I rang his home about half an hour later I was told he had just gone out, by a maid, on a guess."
"Where does he live?"

ppened to notice that there was an au in four of the names: Paul, Ault, Maud, and Vaughn, but I might have; anybody might. That was nothing special. The point was, if I had noticed it, then what? I would have filed it as just coincidence, and probably Wolfe had too. But although filed, that au in four of the names was still somewhere in his mind later, when it got really tough, so in going over and over it, every detail and every factor, that popped up. Okay, but then what? Did he deliberately team them up?
Paul and Ault Paul and Maud Paul and Vaughn Ault and Maud Ault and Vaughn Maud and Vaughn
Then did he consider each pair and finally decide that the one that might not be just coincidence was Ault and Maud, because if a woman named Ault changed her name she might pick one that had au in it? No. I could have done that myself. I hadn't, but I could. What had happened in his mind that had made him phone Samuel Vaughn and Otto Drucker, and send me to Evansville, was something that had never happened in mine and never would. He had said "tenuous almost to nullity." But there I was in Evansville, and I knew who had killed Susan Brooke and Peter Vaughn, and probably I never would have known if Wolfe hadn't started reflecting on a diphthong.
Reflecting that I had been wasting some precious time, I turned over to go to sleep, but jor butted in. She had not only used the Ault au in Maud, she had also used the Marjorie jor in Jordan. If Wolfe had known Mrs. Ault's name was Marjorie he would have sewed it up a week ago. On that I slept.
==> I had left a call for 7:45 because on 35th Street it would be 8:45 and I wanted to get Wolfe before he went up to the plant rooms. I did. Fritz answered and relayed it to Wolfe's room, and his voice came, gruff. <==
"Yes?"

Me. I've had four hours' sleep and I need more, so I'll make it brief. If I talked for an hour you'd like every word of it. Wrapped up. Not a single snag. Reserve a room at the Churchill for Mr. George Sievers." I spelled it. "He'll arrive around eight-thirty this evening and so will
I. Tell Fritz not to keep my dinner warm; I'll eat with Sievers on the plane." "Are there any relatives in Evansville?"
"No. She's alone in the world, as she told you."

"No. She's alone in the world, as she told you."
He grunted. "Very satisfactory." He hung up.
Sometimes I think he overdoes it. I admit everything had been said that needed saying, but he might at least have asked how the weather was or if my bed was all right. It was. I rolled over and went back to sleep.
It wasn't absolutely essential to see H. Ernest Littauer, and I don't know when I would have moved again if the phone hadn't rung. As I reached for it I glanced at my wrist: 10:42. It was Lieutenant Sievers. He said he had fixed it to go, and there was an hour's difference between Evansville and Louisville, so we should roll by one o'clock to make the five-o'clock plane. I made it to my feet with the help of a healthy groan and headed for the bathroom.
Perhaps the trouble with my experiences with lawyers is that I am never a prospective client, ready with a checkbook for a retainer. All I ever have is questions, usually questions they would prefer not to answer, and so it was with H. Ernest Littauer, in a big sunny room with a fine view of the Ohio River. I merely wanted to know if he had been in communication with Mrs. Marjorie Ault during the past year or so, and he merely didn't want to tell me. And he didn't, but I gathered that he had no idea where she was and didn't care.

It was twenty minutes past noon when I stepped out of the lobby of the Westside Hotel. I felt like walking. For one thing, I was still loose, and it was nice to walk without wondering if I had company. For another thing, I didn't want to think hard on top, and when I walk the hard thinking, if any, is down where it doesn't use words. And for a third thing, I wanted to do some sightseeing. It was a nice sunny winter day, not much wind, and I crossed town to Sixth Avenue and turned south.
To show the kind of thinking that comes on top with no effort when I'm walking, as I crossed Washington Square I was thinking that it was a coincidence that Arbor Street was in the Village and Sarah Dacos lived in the Village. That

 couldn't be called a hard thought, since a quarter of a million people lived in the Village, more or less, and I have known fancier coincidences, but it's a fair sample of what my mind does when I'm walking.
I had been in Arbor Street before, no matter why for this report. It's narrow and only three blocks long, with an assortment of old brick houses on either side. Number 63, which was near the middle, had nothing distinctive about it. I stood across the street and looked it over. The windows on the third floor, where Morris Althaus had lived and died, had tan drapes that were drawn. I went to the corner around which the G-men had parked their car. As I said, sightseeing, loose. Actually, of course, I was professionally observing the scene of a crime which might be going to have my attention. It helps somehow. Helps me, not Wolfe; he wouldn't go to the window to see the scene of a crime. I would have liked to go up to the third floor for a look at the living room, but I wanted to get home in time for lunch, so I backtracked to Christopher Street and flagged a taxi.
==> The reason I wanted to be there for lunch was the rule that business must never be mentioned during meals. It was twenty past one when Fritz let me in and I put my coat and hat on the rack, so Wolfe was at the table. Going to the dining room and taking my place across from him, I made a remark about the weather. He grunted and swallowed a bite of braised sweetbread. Fritz came with the dish, and I took some. I was not being merely petty; I was showing him that sometimes rules can be damn silly; one you make so you can enjoy your food can just about spoil a meal. It didn't spoil mine, but there wasn't much conversation. <==
But there was another reason for saving it. As we pushed our chairs back I told him I wanted to show him something in the basement, and I led the way to the hall, then to the right, and down the steps. The basement has Fritz's room and bath, a storeroom, and a large room with a pool table. In the last is not only the usual raised bench, but also a big comfortable chair on a platform, for Wolfe when he feels like watching Saul Panzer and me use our cues, which happens about once a year. I led him to that room, flipped the wall switch for light, and spoke.
"Your new office. I hope you like it. There may be only one chance in a million that they can bug a room without getting inside, but that's one too many. Be seated." I lifted my rump onto the rim of the pool table, facing the big chair.
He glared. "Are you badgering me or is it possible?"

The reason I wanted to be there for lunch was the rule that business must never be mentioned during meals. It was twenty past one when Fritz let me in and I put my coat and hat on the rack, so Wolfe was at the table. Going to the dining room and taking my place across from him, I made a remark about the weather. He grunted and swallowed a bite of braised sweetbread. Fritz came with the dish, and I took some. I was not being merely petty; I was showing him that sometimes rules can be damn silly; one you make so you can enjoy your food can just about spoil a meal. It didn't spoil mine, but there wasn't much conversation.
==> But there was another reason for saving it. As we pushed our chairs back I told him I wanted to show him something in the basement, and I led the way to the hall, then to the right, and down the steps. The basement has Fritz's room and bath, a storeroom, and a large room with a pool table. In the last is not only the usual raised bench, but also a big comfortable chair on a platform, for Wolfe when he feels like watching Saul Panzer and me use our cues, which happens about once a year. I led him to that room, flipped the wall switch for light, and spoke. <==
"Your new office. I hope you like it. There may be only one chance in a million that they can bug a room without getting inside, but that's one too many. Be seated." I lifted my rump onto the rim of the pool table, facing the big chair.
He glared. "Are you badgering me or is it possible?"


"It's conceivable. I wouldn't risk leaking it that Inspector Cramer told me to give you his regards. Also that he bought me a carton of milk, shook my hand, and wished me a happy New Year."

He advanced to the desk. "I am a friend of Miss Marian Hinckley. I want to know what kind of a game you're playing. I want an explanation."
"Bah," Wolfe said.
"Don't bah me! What are you up to?"
"This is ridiculous," Wolfe said. "I like eyes at a level. If you can only blather at me, Mr. Goodwin will put you out. If you will take that chair, change your tone, and give me an acceptable reason why I should account to you, I may listen."
Quayle opened his mouth and shut it again. He turned his head to look at me, there on my feet, apparently to see if I was man enough. I would have liked it just as well if he had decided I wasn't, for after that night and day I would have welcomed an excuse to twist another arm. But he vetoed it, went to the red leather chair and sat, and scowled at Wolfe. "I know about you," he said. Not so blathery, but not at all sociable. "I know how you operate. If you want to hook Mrs. Althaus for some change, that's her lookout, but you're not going to drag Miss Hinckley in. I don't intend - "
==> "Archie," Wolfe snapped. "Put him out. Fritz will open the door." He pushed a button. <==
I stepped to about arm's length from the red leather chair and stood looking down at the hero. Fritz came, and Wolfe told him to hold the front door open, and he went.
Quayle's situation was bad. With me standing there in front of him, if he started to leave the chair I could get about any hold I wanted while he was coming up. But my situation was bad too. Removing a 180-pound man from a padded armchair is a problem, and he had savvy enough to stay put, leaning back. But his feet weren't pulled in enough. I started my hands for his shoulders, then dived and got his ankles and yanked and kept going, and had him in the hall, on his back, before he could even try to counter, and then the damn fool tried to turn to get hand leverage on the floor. At the front door I braked when Fritz got his arms

 and held them down.
"There's snow on the stoop," I said. "If I let you up and give you your hat and coat, just walk out. I know more tricks than you do. Right?"

We let go, and he scrambled to his feet. Fritz got his coat from the rack, but he said, "I want to go back in. I'm going to ask him something."
"No. You have bad manners. We'd have to bounce you again." "No you wouldn't. I want to "ask" him something."
"Politely. Tactfully."
"Yes."
I shut the door. "You can have two minutes. Don't sit down, don't raise your voice, and don't use words like 'goon.' Lead the way, Fritz."

We filed down the hall and in, Fritz in front and me in the rear. Wolfe, whose good ears hear what is said in the hail, gave him a cold eye as he stopped short of the desk, surrounded by Fritz and me.

Time's up," I said, and took his arm to turn him.

==> At ten minutes past nine in the evening of that long day I went to the kitchen. Wolfe was at the center table with Fritz, arguing about the number of juniper berries to put in a marinade for venison loin chops. Knowing that that could go on and on, I said, "Excuse me. They're all here, and more. David Althaus, the father, came along. He's the bald one, to your right at the back. Also a lawyer named Bernard Fromm, to your left at the back. Long-headed and hard-eyed." <==
Wolfe frowned. "I don't want him." "Of course not. Shall I tell him so?"
"Confound it." He turned to Fritz. "Very well, proceed. I say three, but proceed as you will. If you put in five I won't even have to taste it; the smell will tell me. With four it might be palatable." He gave me a nod and I headed for the office, and he followed.
He circled around Mrs. Althaus in the red leather chair and stood while I pronounced names. There were two rows of yellow chairs, with Vincent Yannack, Marian Hinckley, and Timothy Quayle in front, and David Althaus and Bernard Fromm in the rear. That put Quayle nearest me, which had seemed advisable. Wolfe sat, sent his eyes left to right and back again, and spoke. "I should tell you that it may be that with an electronic eavesdropping device agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation hear everything that is said in this room. Mr. Goodwin and I think it unlikely, but it is quite possible. I feel that you -"
"Why would they?" Fromm the lawyer. The courtroom tone, cross-examination.
"That will appear, Mr. Fromm. I feel that you should be aware of that possibility, however remote. Now I beg you to indulge me. I'm going to talk a while. I can expect you to help further my interest only if I can demonstrate that your interest runs with mine. You are the father, the mother, the fiancee, and the associates of a man who was murdered seven weeks ago, and the murderer has not been exposed. I intend to expose him. I intend to establish that Morris Althaus was killed by an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That intention - "

ey made two demands simultaneously. Yarmack demanded, "How?" and Fromm demanded, "Why?"

"So do I." Wolfe pushed his chair back and rose. "It's possible, if this conversation has been overheard, that one or more of you "will" be harassed. If so I would like to know. I would like to know of any development that comes to your knowledge, however trivial. Whether the conversation was overheard or not, this house is under surveillance, and the FBI now knows that I am concerning myself with the murder of Morris Althaus. The police do not, as far as I know, and I request you not to tell them; that would only make it more difficult. I apologize for not offering you refreshment; I was preoccupied. Mr. Althaus, you have not spoken. Do you wish to?"
"No," David Althaus said - his one and only word. "Then good evening." Wolfe walked out.


As they left their chairs and moved toward the hall I stood. The gentlemen could help the ladies with their coats; I wasn't needed. I must have been about as low as you can get, for it didn't occur to me that it would be a pleasure to hold Miss Hinckley's coat until I heard the front door open, and then it was too late. I stayed put until I heard it close and then went and bolted it. They were down on the sidewalk.
==> I hadn't heard the elevator, so Wolfe must be in the kitchen, and I headed for it. But he wasn't. Neither was Fritz. Had he actually climbed the stairs? Why? The only other way was down. I chose that, and as I descended I heard his voice. It came from the open door to Fritz's room, and I stepped to it and entered. <==
Fritz could have had a room upstairs, but he prefers the basement. His den is as big as the office and front room combined, but over the years it has got pretty cluttered - tables with stacks of magazines, busts of Escoffier and Brillat-Savarin on stands, framed menus on the walls, a king-size bed, five chairs, shelves of books (he has 289 cookbooks), a head of a wild boar he shot in the Vosges, a TV and stereo cabinet, two large cases of ancient cooking vessels, one of which he thinks was used by Julius Caesar's chef, and so on.
Wolfe was in the biggest chair by a table, with a bottle of beer and a glass. Fritz, seated across from him, got up as I entered, but I moved another chair up.
"It's too bad," I said, "that the elevator doesn't come down. Maybe we can have it done."
Wolfe drank beer, put the glass down, and licked his lips. "I want to know," he said, "about those electronic abominations. Could we be heard here?"
"I don't know. I've read about a thing that is supposed to pick up voices half a mile off, but I don't know about how much area it covers or about obstructions like walls and floors. There could be items I haven't read about that can take a whole house. If there aren't there soon will be. People will have to talk with their hands."

"Could whispers be heard?"
"No. A billion to one. To nothing."
"Then we'll whisper."
==> "That would cramp your style. If Fritz turns the television on, fairly loud, and we sit close and don't yell, that will do it." <==
"We could do that in the office."
"Yes, sir.
"Why the devil didn't you suggest it?"
I nodded. "You're in a stew. So am I. I'm surprised I thought of it now. Let's try it here. In the office I'd have to lean across your desk."

Fritz went to the cabinet and turned a knob, and soon a woman was telling a man she was sorry she had ever met him. He asked (not the man, Fritz) if it was loud enough, and I said a little louder and moved my chair nearer Wolfe. He leaned forward and growled, eighteen inches from my ear, "We'll prepare for a contingency. Do you know if the Ten for Aristology is still in existence?"
My shoulders went up and down. It takes a moron or a genius to ask a question that has no bearing whatever. "No," I said. "That was seven years ago. It probably is. I can ring Lewis Hewitt."
"Not from here."
"I'll go to a booth. Now?"
"Yes. If he says that group still - No. Whatever he says about the Ten for Aristology, ask him if I may call on him tomorrow morning to consult him on an urgent private matter. If he invites me to lunch, as he will, accept."

==> Fritz went to the cabinet and turned a knob, and soon a woman was telling a man she was sorry she had ever met him. He asked (not the man, Fritz) if it was loud enough, and I said a little louder and moved my chair nearer Wolfe. He leaned forward and growled, eighteen inches from my ear, "We'll prepare for a contingency. Do you know if the Ten for Aristology is still in existence?" <==
My shoulders went up and down. It takes a moron or a genius to ask a question that has no bearing whatever. "No," I said. "That was seven years ago. It probably is. I can ring Lewis Hewitt."
"Not from here."
"I'll go to a booth. Now?"
"Yes. If he says that group still - No. Whatever he says about the Ten for Aristology, ask him if I may call on him tomorrow morning to consult him on an urgent private matter. If he invites me to lunch, as he will, accept."
"He lives on Long Island the year around."

"We won't need to. If I am seen going to him so much the better." "Then why not call him from here?"
"Because I'm willing, I even wish, to have my visit to him known, but not that I invited myself."

What if he can't make it tomorrow?"
"Then as soon as possible."
==> I went. As I mounted to the hall and got my coat and hat and let myself out and headed for Ninth Avenue, I was thinking, two rules down the drain in one day - the morning schedule and not leaving the house on business - and why? The Ten for Aristology was a bunch of ten well-heeled men who were, to quote, "pursuing the ideal of perfection in food and drink." Seven years back, at the home of one of them, Benjamin Schriver, the shipping tycoon, they had met to pursue their ideal by eating and drinking, and Lewis Hewitt, a member, had arranged with Wolfe for Fritz to cook the dinner. Naturally Wolfe and I had been invited and had gone, and the guy between us at the table had been fed arsenic with the first course, caviar on blinis topped with sour cream, and had died. Quite a party. It had not affected Wolfe's relations with Lewis Hewitt, who was still grateful for a special favor Wolfe had done him long ago, who had a hundred-foot-long orchid house at his Long Island estate, and who came to dinner at the old brownstone about twice a year. <==
It took a while to get him because the call had to be switched to the greenhouse or the stables or maybe the john, but it was a pleasure for him to hear my voice; he said so. When I told him Wolfe would like to pay him a call he said he would be delighted and that of course we would lunch with him, and added that he would like to ask Wolfe a question regarding the lunch.
"I'm afraid I'll have to do," I told him. "I'm calling from a booth in a drugstore. Excuse my glove, but is there any chance that someone is on an extension?"
"Why - why no. There would he no reason..."
"Okay. I'm calling from a booth because our wire is tapped and Mr. Wolfe doesn't want it known that he suggested calling on you. So don't ring our number. It's conceivable that you might get a call tomorrow afternoon from someone who says he's a reporter and wants to ask questions. I mention it now because I might forget to tomorrow. The idea is, this appointment, our coming to lunch tomorrow, was made last week. All right?"
"Yes, of course. But good heavens, if you know your phone is tapped - isn't that illegal?"

"Yes, of course. But good heavens, if you know your phone is tapped - isn't that illegal?"

Sure, that's why it's fun. We'll tell you about it tomorrow - I "guess" we will." He said he would save his curiosity for tomorrow and would expect us by noon.
==> There is a TV set and a radio in the office, and when I got back I was expecting to see Wolfe there in his favorite chair, probably with the radio going, but the office was empty, so I proceeded to the rear and down to the basement and found him where I had left him. The television was still on, and Fritz was sitting watching it, yawning. Wolfe was leaning back with his eyes shut, and his lips were going, pushing out and then in, out and in. So he was working, but on what? I stood and looked at him. That's the one thing I never break in on, the lip operation, but that time I had to clamp my jaw to keep my mouth shut because I didn't believe it. There was absolutely nothing he could be hatching. Two full minutes. Three. I decided he was only practicing, it was a dry run, went to a chair, sat, and coughed loud. In a moment he opened his eyes, blinked at me, and straightened up. <==
I moved my chair closer. "All set," I said. "We're expected by noon, so we should roll by ten-thirty."
"You're not going," he growled. "I telephoned Saul. He'll come at nine." "Oh. I see. You want me here in case Wragg sends them to confess."
"I want you to find Frank Odell."
"For God's sake. Is "that" what your lips squeezed out."
"No." He turned his head. "A little louder, Fritz." Back to me: "I said after lunch that you had made it clear that it would be futile to establish that the FBI committed that murder. I retract that. I will not bow to futility. We must arrange a situation in which none of the three alternatives would be futile. They are: one, establish that the FBI committed the murder; two, establish that they didn't; and three, establish neither one, let the murder go. We prefer by far the second alternative, and that is why you are to find Frank Odell, but if we are forced to accept the first or the third we must manage circumstances so that we will nevertheless be in a position to fulfill our obligation to our client."

"You have no obligation except to investigate and use your best efforts." "Your pronouns again."

 "All right, 'we' and 'our.'"
"That's better. Just so, our best efforts. The strongest obligation possible for a man with self-esteem, and we both have our full share of that. One point is vital. No matter which alternative circumstances compel us to accept, Mr. Wragg must believe, or at least suspect, that one of his men killed Morris Althaus. I can contrive no maneuver by us that would contribute to that; I was trying to when you returned. Can you?"
"No. He either believes it or he doesn't. Ten to one he does."

No response. I turned. He was sound asleep in the chair, probably snoring, but if so the TV covered it. I suggested moving to the office and trying some WQXR music for a change, and Wolfe agreed, so we woke Fritz and thanked him for his hospitality and told him good night. On the way to the office I stopped off for beer for Wolfe and milk for me, and when I joined him he had the radio going and was back of his desk. Since it was going to take time I brought a yellow chair and put it near his. He poured beer, and I took a swallow of milk and said, "I forgot to say that I didn't ask Hewitt about the Ten for Aristology. You wanted to see him anyway and you can ask him tomorrow. And the program?"
He spoke.
It was well after midnight when he went to the elevator and I went to get the sheets and blankets and pillow for my second night on the couch.

There were more than a hundred Odells in the phone books of the five boroughs, but no Frank. That established, I sat at my desk at half past nine Friday morning and considered recourses. It wasn't the kind of problem to discuss with Wolfe, and anyway he wasn't available. Saul Panzer had come at nine o'clock on the dot, and instead of going up to the plant rooms Wolfe had come down, put on his heavy overcoat and broad-brimmed beaver hat, and followed Saul out to the curb to climb into the Heron sedan. Of course he knew that the heater, if turned on

There were more than a hundred Odells in the phone books of the five boroughs, but no Frank. That established, I sat at my desk at half past nine Friday morning and considered recourses. It wasn't the kind of problem to discuss with Wolfe, and anyway he wasn't available. Saul Panzer had come at nine o'clock on the dot, and instead of going up to the plant rooms Wolfe had come down, put on his heavy overcoat and broad-brimmed beaver hat, and followed Saul out to the curb to climb into the Heron sedan. Of course he knew that the heater, if turned on

 full, could make the inside of the Heron like an oven, but he took the heavy coat because he distrusted all machines more complicated than a wheelbarrow. He would have been expecting to be stranded at some wild and lonely spot in the Long Island jungle even if I had been driving.
It took will power to fasten my mind on the Frank Odell caper, which was merely a stab in the dark blindfolded, ordered by Wolfe only because he preferred the second of the three alternatives. Where my mind wanted to be was on Long Island. In all my experience of Wolfe's arrangements of circumstances I had never known him to concoct anything as tricky as the program he was going to rope Lewis Hewitt in for, and I should have been there. Genius is fine for the ignition spark, but to get there someone has to see that the radiator doesn't leak and no tire is flat. I would have insisted on going if it hadn't been for Saul Panzer. Wolfe had said that Saul would sit in, and he is the one man I would turn any problem over to if I broke a leg.
I forced my mind onto Frank Odell. The obvious thing was to ring the New York State Parole Division and ask if they had him listed. But of course not on our phone. If the FBI knew that we were spending time and money on Odell after what Quayle had said about him, they would know it wasn't just prudence, that we thought there was actually a chance that he was involved, and that wouldn't do. I decided to play it absolutely safe. If some G-man reads this and thinks I'm overrating his outfit, he isn't inside far enough to know all the family secrets. I'm not inside at all, but I've been around a lot.
==> After going to the kitchen to tell Fritz I was leaving and to the hall for my coat and hat, I let myself out, walked to Tenth Avenue and on to the garage, got permission from Tom Halloran to use the phone, dialed the "Gazette" number, and got Lon Cohen. He was discreet. He didn't ask me how we were making out with Mrs. Bruner and the FBI. He did ask if I knew where he could get a bottle of brandy. <==
"I might send you one someday," I said, "if you earn it. You can start now. About two years ago a man named Frank Odell was sent up for fraud. If he behaved himself and got a reduction he may he out and on the parole list. I've gone in for social work and I want to find him, quick, and rehabilitate him. You can get me, the sooner the better, at this number." I gave it to him. "I'm keeping my social work secret, so please don't mention it."
He said an hour should do it, and I went out to the floor to give motor vehicles a

 look. Wolfe buys a new one every year, thinking that reduces the risk of a collapse, which it doesn't, and he leaves the choice to me. I have been tempted to get a Rolls, but it would be a shame to ditch it after only a year. That day there was nothing on the floor I would have traded the Heron for. Tom and I were discussing the dashboard of a 45 Lincoln when the phone rang and I went. It was Lon, and he had it. Frank Odell had been released in August and would be on parole until the end of February. He lived at 2553 Lamont Avenue, Bronx, and he had a job at a branch of the Driscoll Renting Agency at 4618 Grand Concourse. Lon said that a good way to start rehabilitating him would be to get him in a poker game, and I said I thought craps would be better.
I decided to take the subway instead of a taxi, not to save the client money, but because I thought it was about time to do something about tails. There had been two days and nights since the FBI had presumably got interested in us, and twenty-five hours since they had asked Perazzo to take our licenses, and I still had seen no sign that I had company. Of course I had dodged or hadn't looked. I now decided to look, but not while walking. I waited until I was at the Grand Central subway station and had boarded an uptown express.

That was no coincidence; it was cause and effect in a hell of a mess. I started to sort it out but soon found that there were so many combinations and possibilities that you could even come up with the notion that Mrs. Bruner had shot Althaus, which wouldn't do, since she was the client. The one conclusion was that there "was" a needle in "this" haystack, and it had to be found. Wolfe had stolen another base. He had merely asked Yarmack if the articles Althaus had written for "Tick-Tock" were innocuous, and had merely told me to find Odell because he couldn't think of anything sensible for me, and here was this.
I couldn't have called Wolfe even if he had been at home, and I decided not to ring him at Hewitt's. Not only does a place like that have a dozen or more extensions, but also G-men had probably followed him there, since Saul had been told to ignore tails, and tapping a line in the country was a cinch for them. I happen to know that they once - But I'll skip it.
But I was not going to go home and sit on it until he got back. I found a phone

 booth, dialed Mrs. Bruner's number and got her, and asked if she could meet me at Rusterman's at twelve-thirty for lunch. She said she could. I rang Rusterman's and got Felix and asked if I could have the soundproofed room upstairs, the small one. He said I could. I went out and got a taxi.
==> Rusterman's has lost some of the standing it had when Marko Vukcic was alive. Wolfe is no longer the trustee, but he still goes there about once a month and Felix comes to the old brownstone now and then for advice. When Wolfe goes, taking Fritz and me, we eat in the small room upstairs, and we always start with the queen of soups, Germiny a l'Oseille. So I knew that room well. Felix was there with me, being sociable, when Mrs. Bruner came, only ten minutes late. <==
She wanted a double dry martini with onion. You never know; I would have guessed hers would be sherry or Dubonnet, and certainly not the onion. When it came she took three healthy sips in a row, looked to see that the waiter had closed the door, and said, "Of course I didn't ask you on the phone. Something has happened?"
I had a martini to keep her company, without the onion. I took a sip and said, "Nothing big. Mr. Wolfe has broken two rules today. He skipped his morning session in the plant rooms, and he left the house on business - your business. He is out on Long Island seeing a man. That could develop into something, but don't hold your breath. As for me, I just made a trip to the Bronx to see a man named Frank Odell. He used to work for you - Bruner Realty. Didn't he?"
"Odell?" "Yes."
She frowned. "I don't - Oh, of course. Odell, that's the little man who had all that trouble. But he - isn't he in prison?"
"He was. He was paroled out a few months ago.

"Yes, sir.
"Why? Why not the office?"
"It will be better here. Unless you want an attractive young woman practically sitting on your lap for a couple of hours with the radio going."
"What young woman?"
"Sarah Dacos, Mrs. Bruner's secretary. I'll report when you come. ""If" I come. Very well." He hung up.
==> I dialed the number I knew best and told Fritz we would dine at Rusterman's and he would have to leave the venison chops in the marinade until tomorrow. Then I got Mrs. David Althaus's number from the book and dialed it, but by the time she got on I had decided not to ask her on the phone. All I wanted to know was if she had ever heard her son mention a girl named Sarah Dacos, but I had three hours to kill, so I might as well take a walk. I asked if she would let me in if I came around four-thirty, and she said yes. On the way out I told Felix that Wolfe and I would be there for dinner. <==
9
I was back in the soundproofed room, on my fanny with my legs stretched out

 and my eyes focused on my toes, going over the mess for the tenth time, when Wolfe arrived at twenty minutes to seven, ushered in by Felix. Knowing that was the busiest time of day downstairs for Felix, I shooed him out and took Wolfe's coat and hung it up and said I hoped he had had an interesting trip.
He growled and went and sat in the armchair which Marko Vukcic had bought years ago for his friend Nero's exclusive use. Between Wolfe's visits it is kept in the room that was Marko's personal den. "I have decided," he said, "that every man alive today is half idiot and half hero. Only heroes could survive in the maelstrom, and only idiots would want to."

"The hell we haven't. We have someone who had some reason for thinking they were G-men and is saving it. That will be pie for Cramer."
"No. It's our pie. We'll give Mr. Cramer Miss Dacos only when we have her ourselves, if at all." He pushed his chair back. "Get it out of her. Tomorrow. I'm tired. We're going home and to bed."

At 10:35 Saturday morning I used a key on the door of 63 Arbor Street, ascended two flights of wooden stairs, used another key, and entered the apartment that had been Morris Althaus's.
I was following my own approach to the problem of getting it out of Sarah Dacos. I admit it was roundabout, especially in view of the fact that time was short, but it was a better stab at getting results than persuading her to go to the Flamingo for an evening of dancing. The fact that time was short had been made publicly evident by an item on the twenty-eighth page of the morning paper, which I had read at my breakfast table in the kitchen. It was headlined FINGERS CROSSED? and said:
==> The members of the Ten for Aristology, one of the most exclusive of New York's gourmet groups, evidently do not believe that history repeats itself. Lewis Hewitt, capitalist, socialite, orchid fancier, and aristologist, will entertain the group at dinner at his home at North Cove, Long Island, on Thursday evening, January 14. The menu will be chosen by Nero Wolfe, the well-known private investigator, and the food will be prepared by Fritz Brermer, Mr. Wolfe's chef. Mr. Wolfe and Archie Goodwin, his confidential assistant, will be present as guests. <==
That arrangement arouses memory of another occasion when Mr. Brenner cooked a dinner for the Ten for Aristology, and Mr. Wolfe and Mr. Goodwin were guests, at the home of Benjamin Schriver, the shipping magnate. It occurred on April 1, 1958, and one of the Ten, Vincent Pyle, head of a Wall Street brokerage firm, was poisoned with arsenic in his portion of the first course, served to him by Carol Annis, who was subsequently convicted of first- degree murder.


Yesterday a "Times" reporter, remembering that former occasion, telephoned Mr. Hewitt and asked him if any of the Ten for Aristology (aristology means science of dining) had shown any reluctance to attend the affair next Thursday, and Mr. Hewitt said no. When the reporter asked him if he would keep his fingers crossed he said, "How can I? I couldn't handle my knife and fork."
It will certainly be an excellent meal.

When the reporter asked him if he would keep his fingers crossed he said, "How can I? I couldn't handle my knife and fork."
It will certainly be an excellent meal.
==> Setting the date definitely, Thursday the fourteenth, was the detail I had been hottest about when discussing it with Wolfe Thursday night. I said it should be left open, that the item in the paper could say something like "some evening this month." Wolfe said that Hewitt, when phoning his fellow aristologists, would have to name a date. I said he could tell them it would have to be indefinite because it would depend on when Fritz could get something shipped by air from France. Gourmets love things shipped by air from France. But Wolfe had insisted, and now we were stuck with it, only five days to go. <==
So I hadn't liked the roundabout approach to Sarah Dacos, but it was obviously the best bet, and right after breakfast I had phoned Mrs. Althaus to ask if she could give me ten minutes. She had said yes, and I had gone, of course ignoring the tail problem. The more they saw me working the Althaus angle, the better. I told her there had been some developments which we would tell her about when we had figured them out, and it might help if she would let me take a look at everything that had been in her son's apartment, at least what was left of it. She said everything was left. The lease had nearly a year to go, and they hadn't tried to sublet. They hadn't removed anything, and as far as she knew the police hadn't either; they hadn't asked for permission to. I promised to take nothing without her permission if she would let me go and have a look, and she went and got the keys without phoning the lawyer or even her husband. Perhaps I appeal more to middle-aged women than to young ones, but don't try to tell Wolfe that.
So at 10:35 Saturday morning I entered the apartment of the late Morris Althaus, shut the door, and sent my eyes around. It wasn't bad at all if you ignored the pictures. As Sarah Dacos had said, the wall-to-wall carpet was thick. There was a big couch with a coffee table in front of it, a good sitting chair near a lamp, four other chairs, a small table with a metal object on it that might have been created by some kid handy with tools out of junk stuff he found in the garage, a large desk with nothing much on it besides a telephone, and a typewriter on a

 stand. Most of one wall had bookshelves, full, nearly to the ceiling. The less said about the pictures on the other walls the better. They would have been fine for a guessing game - have a party and everybody guesses what they are - if you could find someone who knew the answers.
I put my hat and coat on the couch and toured. Two closets in the living room. There was a bathroom, a small kitchen, and a bedroom with a single bed, a chest of drawers, a dresser, two chairs, and a closet full of clothes. On the dresser were framed photographs of his father and mother, so he hadn't resigned from the family, only from Peggy Pilgrim. I returned to the living room and started looking. With the tan drapes drawn it was dim, and I turned the lights on. The dust was thick on everything, but I was there legally and properly, so I didn't bother to put gloves on.

"No I don't, but it seems familiar." "It should. Where did you get it?" "I'll tell you someday. What is it?"
"It's a take-off of the last four lines of the second stanza of Keats's 'Ode on a Grecian Urn.' It's sort of clever, but no one should monkey with Keats. Escamillo, you're a pretty good detective and you dance like an angel, and you have other outstanding qualities, but you will never be a highbrow. Come and read Keats to me."
I told her she was too jejune, hung up, slipped the photograph back in my pocket, and went out and took my fifth taxi in five hours. The client could afford it.
It was five minutes to two when I put my hat and coat on the rack in the hall, went to the door of the dining room, told Wolfe, who was at the table, that it looked and felt like snow, and proceeded to the kitchen. I don't join Wolfe when

==>  I arrive in the middle of a meal; we agree that for one man to hurry with meat or fish while the other dawdles with pastry or cheese is bad for the atmosphere. Fritz put things on my breakfast table and brought what was left of the baked bluefish, and I asked him how he was getting on with the menu for next Thursday's blowout. <==
"I'm not discussing that," he said. "I am not discussing anything, Archie. He was in my room for more than an hour before lunch, talking with the television on loud. If it is so dangerous I will not talk at all."
I told him we should be back to normal by the time the shad roe started coming, and he threw up his hands and said good God in French.
When I finished and went to the office Wolfe was standing over by the globe, turning it and scowling at it. The man who gave him that globe, the biggest one I have ever seen, couldn't have known what a big help it would be. Whenever a situation gets so ticklish that he wishes he were somewhere else, he can walk over to the globe and pick spots to go to. Wonderful. As I entered he asked if I had anything, and when I nodded he went to his desk and I turned on the radio, took a yellow chair around near his elbow, and reported. It didn't take long, since there had been no conversation to speak of, just the action. I didn't mention the phone call to Lily Rowan because it had been purely personal. Having read the poetry twice, he handed the photograph back to me and said she had an ear for meter.
"I told you she wasn't a sap," I said. "Pretty neat, doing that with the last four lines of the second stanza of Keats's 'Ode on a Grecian Urn.'"
His eyes narrowed at me. "How the deuce do you know that? You don't read Keats."

At 9:35 I dialed the Bruner number, and it was answered. "Mrs. Bruner's office, good morning."
"Good morning. Miss Dacos?" "Yes."
"This is Archie Goodwin. I may need to see Mrs. Bruner later today, and I'm calling to ask if she'll be available."

She said it depended on how late, Mrs. Bruner expected to be in the office from three-thirty to five-thirty, and I said I would call again if I needed to come.
==> So she was at her job. I would have to take a chance on the cleaning woman. I went to the kitchen to tell Fritz I was going out to make some phone calls, to the hall for my hat and coat, and out and to Ninth Avenue for a taxi. <==
For the street door at 63 Arbor Street I still had the key Mrs. Althaus had given me, so I was clean until I stood at Sarah Dacos's door and got out the collection of keys. When I had knocked twice, and pushed the button twice and heard the ring, with no response, I tried a key. The fourth one did it, smooth and easy. I put the gloves on, turned the knob, opened the door, crossed the sill, and shut the door, and I had broken and entered according to the statutes of the State of New York.
The layout was the same as upstairs, but the furniture was quite different. Rugs here and there instead of carpet, smaller couch smothered with pillows, no desk or typewriter, fewer chairs, about one-fourth as many books, five little pictures on the walls which the bold lover must have considered old hat. The drapes were drawn, and I turned the lights on, put my coat and hat on the couch, and went and opened a closet door.
There were two facts: the cleaning woman might come any minute, and I had no idea what I might find, if anything. The point was simply that there might be something that would help, no matter what was going to happen Thursday night, to square it with Cramer for that carton of milk. A fast once-over was called for, and I spent only ten minutes on the living room and its two closets and then went to the bedroom.
I came mighty close to passing it by. The bedroom closet was crammed - clothes on hangers, shoe racks, luggage, cartons and hatboxes on two high shelves. The bag and two suitcases were packed with summer clothes, and I skipped the hatboxes; I would have given a finif of "my" money to know if the cleaning woman came Wednesdays. But ten minutes later, going through a drawerful of photographs one by one, I realized that it was dumb to skip the hatboxes and then waste time with a bunch of photographs which could tell me nothing I didn't already know, so I took a chair to the closet, mounted it, and got the boxes down. There were three. The first one contained three so-called hats and two bikinis. The second one held one big floppy hat. I lifted it out, and there on the bottom was a revolver. I gawked at it for five seconds, then took it out and inspected it.

 It was an S &amp; W.38 and held one cartridge that had been fired and five that hadn't.
I stood with it in my hand. It was a hundred to one that it was the gun that Althaus had had a permit for, and it had fired the bullet that had gone through him, and Sarah Dacos had pulled the trigger. To hell with the one chance in a hundred. The question was what to do with it. If I took it, it would never be an acceptable exhibit in a murder trial, since I had got it illegally. If I left it there and went out to a phone booth and rang Cramer to tell him to get a warrant to search Sarah Dacos's apartment, the cops would get the gun all right, but if the FBI found out about it within thirty-six hours, as they easily might, the big act for Thursday night would be kaput. And of course if I left it in the hatbox and "didn't" phone Cramer, Sarah Dacos might decide that tonight would be a good time to take it and toss it in the river.
Since that left only one alternative, the only decision that had to be made was where to put it. I returned the hat to the box and the boxes to the shelf, put the chair back where it belonged, and looked around. No spot in the bedroom appealed to me, and I moved to the living room. It was now more than ever desirable not to be interrupted by a cleaning woman or anyone else. I went and examined the couch and found that underneath the cushion was a box spring, and underneath the spring was a plywood bottom. Good enough. If she got the hatbox down and found the gun gone, she certainly wouldn't suppose it had merely been moved to another spot in the apartment and start looking. I put it on the bottom under the spring, glanced around to see that things were as I had found them, grabbed my hat and coat, and got out of there in such a hurry that I almost appeared on the sidewalk wearing rubber gloves.
In the taxi I had to answer another question: did I or didn't I tell Wolfe? Why not wait until Thursday night had come and gone? The answer was really simple, but of course that's one thing we use our minds for, finding complicated reasons for dodging simple answers. By the time the cab stopped in front of the old brownstone my mind had run out of reasons and I was facing the fact that it wouldn't improve with age.
==> It was ten minutes past eleven, so Wolfe would be down from the plant rooms, but he wasn't in the office. There was noise in the kitchen, the radio going loud, and I went there. Wolfe was standing by the big table scowling at Fritz, who was bending over to sniff at a slab of smoked sturgeon. They didn't hear me enter, but Fritz saw me when he straightened up, and Wolfe turned and demanded, <==

 "Where have you been?"
I told him I had a report. He told Fritz to have the cutlets ready at a quarter past two, he wasn't going to wait longer than that, and headed for the office, and I followed. I turned the radio on. As I brought a yellow chair around I saw three screwdrivers on his desk pad - one from my desk drawer and two from the kitchen, and I had to grin. He had the tools ready, himself. As I sat I told him I had assumed that he would eat an early lunch. He said no, if a man has guests he should be at table with them.
"Then there's plenty of time," I said, "to discuss a brief report. With so much on your mind I could save it, but you'll like to know that I have clinched the alternative we prefer. I went for a walk and happened to pass Sixty-three Arbor Street, and I happened to have a key in my pocket that fitted the lock on Sarah Dacos's door, so I went in and looked around, and in a hatbox in a closet I found a revolver, an S and W thirty-eight. One cartridge had been fired. As you know, Cramer told me that Althaus had a permit for an S and W thirty-eight and it wasn't in his apartment, though there was a box of cartridges in a drawer. So she -"
"What did you do with it?"

"What did you do with it?"
"I moved it. It seemed out of place in a box with a lady's hat, so I put it under a box spring on a couch."
He took a deep breath, held it in a second, and let it out. "She shot him," he growled.
"Right. As I was saying when you interrupted." "Will she find it?"

 Even if she stays put I'll have a problem, if tomorrow night is a turkey. If and if. Just now I wanted to ring Hewitt from a booth and ask him if the orchids are packed. Shall I?"
"No. He's busy. I believe guns can be identified?"
"Sure. Scientists can do it now even if the number has been filed off. And Cramer will have the number of the one Althaus had a permit for."
"Then there will be no problem. I must see about that sturgeon." He left his chair and headed for the door. Short of it he stopped and turned, said, "Satisfactory," and went. I shook my head and went on shaking it as I replaced the yellow chair. "There will be no problem," for God's sake. I thought if I had an ego that size I'd be the boss of the FBI, and then realized that that wasn't exactly the way to put it. I returned the keys and gloves to the cabinet, went to the kitchen to get a glass of milk, since lunch would be late, and to listen to them discuss sturgeon.
==> With a couple of hours to go, possibly more, after the milk was down I made the rounds - first two flights up to my room, to see that everything was in order for the guests who would occupy my bed. Fritz isn't supposed to touch my room; it's mine, including the responsibility. It was okay, except that the two pillows I had got from the closet that morning weren't the same size, but that couldn't be helped. Then to the South Room, which is above Wolfe's, where two more guests would sleep on the twin beds. That visit was unnecessary, since Fritz never makes mistakes, but I had time to kill. <==
It got killed somehow.
I wasn't expecting them until two at the earliest, but I should have known better, since Saul was in charge. Wolfe was in the kitchen and I was in the front room, which adjoins the office, checking that blankets were on the sofa, when the doorbell rang and I glanced at my watch. Twenty to two, so it couldn't be the truck.
But it was. Going to the hall, I saw a big bozo in a leather jacket on the stoop. When I opened the door he boomed at me, "Nero Wolfe? Orchids for you!"
I stepped out. At the curb was a big green truck with red lettering on its side: NORTH SHORE TRUCKING CORPORATION. Another big bozo was at its rear, opening the doors. I said fairly loud that it was pretty damn cold for orchids and I would come and help. By the time I got my coat on and went out they had

There were bright spots, two of them on Wednesday and four on Thursday, when Jarvis observed Wolfe. Jarvis would stand at the foot of the stairs and study Wolfe coming down, at the top and study him going down, and in the hall and study him on the level. By the second session Thursday I knew Jarvis was pulling Wolfe's leg, enjoying the look on his face, but I was enjoying it too. Of

 course Kirby observed me the same way, but that was no hardship; on a normal day I go up and down those stairs a dozen times or more. What Kirby couldn't observe was my driving. They would probably be tailed all the way to Hewitt's, and if his style at the wheel was too different from mine it could make a smart G-man suspicious. Thursday morning I took him to the office and turned on the radio and discussed it for half an hour.
Looking back at it, I don't think we missed a single bet. Around eleven o'clock Wednesday night I went up to my room, which fronts on Thirty-fifth Street, paid no more attention to the curtains than usual, changed to pajamas, sat on the bed, and turned out the light on the bed stand. In a couple of minutes Fred and Orrie entered and undressed in the dark, and I got out and they got in. Saul slept on the sofa in the front room, and we didn't turn the lights on in there at all. We rarely do.
I mention a funny thing. As I turned the office lights out Wednesday night and got between sheets on the couch, I was thinking not of the trap we were setting and whether it was going to work, but of the couch in Sarah Dacos's apartment. What if the cleaning woman decided to turn the cushion over and looked under the spring? If I had stayed another five minutes maybe I could have found a better spot.
==> The two meals I mentioned were Wednesday's lunch and dinner. Thursday's breakfast and lunch were different because Fritz wasn't there. The arrangement was that Hewitt would have a car there for Fritz at eight o'clock, and it came right on time. I carried his bag out for him, and at the car door he shook my hand, looking glum. He was in no mood for producing masterpieces for a bunch of aristologists. Saul and I handled the breakfast problem, and for lunch we had cold cuts, including the sturgeon, which had been passed as edible, two bottles of champague, and five kinds of cheese. <==
At 4:45 Thursday afternoon I was in the office with Saul and Fred and Orrie when Theodore Horstmann, the orchid nurse, who had been told to leave early, came downstairs, said good night, and left. Wolfe was up in his room. At 5:10 I went up to my room, turned on the lights, and started changing. I could have made sure that there was no chink in the curtains and just sat, but it wouldn't have been normal for me to bother about chinks and we damned well wanted everything normal. Wolfe, in his room, was doing likewise. At 5:40, dressed for dinner, I went back down to the office, and at 5:45 there was the sound of the elevator, and Wolfe appeared, also dressed. He and I started talking, no radio,

 about traffic problems. At 5:55 on the dot there was a faint sound of footsteps in the hall, and Jarvis and Kirby were there. Jarvis's dinner uniform was a big improvement on Wolfe's, which had seen better years, but Kirby's wasn't up to mine, which had set me back three Cs. They stood at the door. I told Wolfe I would wait in the car, went to the hall, held my coat for Kirby and handed him my hat, and stayed in the corner out of range as he opened the door, crossed the sill, and pulled the door shut. As Jarvis came and stood looking out through the one-way glass, with me at his elbow, the lights in the office went out, and I got Wolfe's coat and hat for Jarvis. In about half an hour which was really about six minutes the Heron showed and came to a stop at the curb. Jarvis flipped the light switch and the hall was dark, but I moved out of range until he was out and the door closed. I watched him and decided he was earning the extra grand. I had had no opinion about Kirby, since I don't know how I look when I walk, but I would have sworn it was Wolfe going down the steps, crossing the sidewalk, and getting into the car, if I hadn't known. The Heron rolled away, smooth, no jerks, like me, and I realized I had been holding my breath God knows how long.
The office was now empty if they had followed the script. Before the lights went out in the hall Wolfe had gone to the dark kitchen, Orrie to the dark dining room, and Saul and Fred through the connecting door to the dark front room. I hadn't heard them, so no one had. I put my hand in my side pocket to touch the Marley.38, stepped to the door and touched the edge to make sure it was closed, stood until my eyes were as well adjusted to the dark as they would get, and sat down on the chair at the wall opposite the rack.
I felt fine. The strain was over. It could have been spoiled a hundred different ways, by either bad handling or bad luck, but here we were, all set, with nothing to do but wait. Either they had decided to do a bag job or they hadn't, and that was their strain, not mine. I didn't know what their score was on bag jobs, no outsider does, but I knew of four in New York the past year, definitely, and I had heard talk of several more. It depended on whether Wragg believed that a G-man had killed Althaus. If he did, ten to one they would come. If he didn't, if he had somehow been satisfied that his men were clean on the murder, they wouldn't come. Whether the bait was good enough depended on him, not on us. I felt fine.

"He's reading a book. "The FBI Nobody Knows." In half an hour hell be in bed." "I'll be there at eleven."
It sounded as if he cradled it with a bang, but I could have imagined that. I turned to Wolfe. "I called him Wragg because that's his name. Eleven o'clock tomorrow morning. As expected."
"And desired. We must confer. When your game is finished."
I rose. "It won't take long. I just melded three hundred and forty."

==> I need, and nearly always get, a good eight hours' sleep, but that night I got six. At 1:10, with Wolfe gone up to bed, and also Fred and Orrie, and Saul on the sofa in the front room, I was about to crawl in on the couch when the doorbell rang. It was Fritz and Jarvis and Kirby, and when I saw Kirby stagger across the threshold I wondered what ditch the Heron was in. I asked him where the car was and he just goggled at me, his lips pressed tight. Thinking he was sticking to <==

 the instructions, I told him he could talk now, and Fritz said he could not talk now because he was too drunk, and added that the car was out in front, perfectly all right, but only the good God knew how it had got there. He took them up to their room in the elevator, and I put on shoes and my overcoat over pajamas, and went out and took the Heron to the garage. Not a scratch.
The first number on the program for Friday was scheduled for 8:30. At 7:45 I turned on the will power and rolled out, got my arms full of blankets and sheets and pillow, and made it up to my room. When I came out of the bathroom after showering and shaving, Fred and Orrie were sitting on the edge of the bed, yawning. I remarked that we would be leaving in an hour and twenty minutes and they told me to go soak my head, but I already had. I was expecting to have to manage my own breakfast, but as I was going downstairs Fritz emerged from Wolfe's room, having delivered the breakfast tray nearly on time. It was 8:28, and I went to the office and started the day by dialing Mrs. Bruner's number and got her. I told her I was sorry to disturb her so early in the day, but I had an important message, and would she please go out to a booth and ring me at a certain number, which I gave her, at 9:45 or as soon after as possible. She said it would interfere with an appointment and how important was it, and I said extremely, and she said all right.
So we could take our time at breakfast, and it was just as well. Fritz knows that Saul and Fred and Orrie all like eggs "au beurre noir", so that was the main item, with toast and bacon, and two rounds for each of us, two eggs to a round, added up to sixteen eggs. The expense account for that operation was going to be a lulu.
With the credentials in my pocket, I left the house with my bodyguard at 9:40, walked to the drugstore at the corner, and stationed myself near the booth. With my understanding of women, I was prepared to wait up to twenty minutes, but at 9:46 it rang, just as a man who had entered was heading for the booth. As I lifted the receiver I decided that he was not a G-man come to take the call; he didn't look the part.

"You couldn't possibly have any appointment half as important," I told her. "Forget appointments. You are to be at Mr. Wolfe's office at a quarter to eleven, not one second later."

 the instructions, I told him he could talk now, and Fritz said he could not talk now because he was too drunk, and added that the car was out in front, perfectly all right, but only the good God knew how it had got there. He took them up to their room in the elevator, and I put on shoes and my overcoat over pajamas, and went out and took the Heron to the garage. Not a scratch.
The first number on the program for Friday was scheduled for 8:30. At 7:45 I turned on the will power and rolled out, got my arms full of blankets and sheets and pillow, and made it up to my room. When I came out of the bathroom after showering and shaving, Fred and Orrie were sitting on the edge of the bed, yawning. I remarked that we would be leaving in an hour and twenty minutes and they told me to go soak my head, but I already had. I was expecting to have to manage my own breakfast, but as I was going downstairs Fritz emerged from Wolfe's room, having delivered the breakfast tray nearly on time. It was 8:28, and I went to the office and started the day by dialing Mrs. Bruner's number and got her. I told her I was sorry to disturb her so early in the day, but I had an important message, and would she please go out to a booth and ring me at a certain number, which I gave her, at 9:45 or as soon after as possible. She said it would interfere with an appointment and how important was it, and I said extremely, and she said all right.
==> So we could take our time at breakfast, and it was just as well. Fritz knows that Saul and Fred and Orrie all like eggs "au beurre noir", so that was the main item, with toast and bacon, and two rounds for each of us, two eggs to a round, added up to sixteen eggs. The expense account for that operation was going to be a lulu. <==
With the credentials in my pocket, I left the house with my bodyguard at 9:40, walked to the drugstore at the corner, and stationed myself near the booth. With my understanding of women, I was prepared to wait up to twenty minutes, but at 9:46 it rang, just as a man who had entered was heading for the booth. As I lifted the receiver I decided that he was not a G-man come to take the call; he didn't look the part.
Mrs. Bruner said she hoped it was really important because she would be late for her appointment.
"You couldn't possibly have any appointment half as important," I told her. "Forget appointments. You are to be at Mr. Wolfe's office at a quarter to eleven, not one second later."

 "This morning? I can't."

At a quarter past four two police cars stopped out in front. One of them found a spot at the curb and the other one double-parked, and I recognized all three of the homicide dicks who got out and headed for Number 63. One of them, Sergeant Purley Stebbins, was probably thinking of me as he pushed the button at the door. He hates to find Nero Wolfe or me in the same county with a homicide, and here he was on an errand we were responsible for. I wanted to go to the hall to hear the conversation when he showed her the warrant, but didn't. He might smell me and it would hold up the search.
It took them not more than ten minutes to find it. They entered the apartment at 4:21, that was when I heard the door close, and Purley left the house with her at 4:43. I'm allowing twelve minutes for him to ask her a few questions after he got the gun. I stood at the window and watched Purley get in the car with her, and

 the car pull off, and then went and sat on the couch. Since he had taken her, the question about the gun was answered. I stayed on the couch a few minutes while my state of mind got adjusted.
I got my hat and coat and went. There was still a NYPD car out in front, waiting for the two dicks still in the apartment, and the driver might know me, but so what? I hadn't recognized him from the window, and I don't know if he knew me or not. As I walked past the car, no hurry, he gave me a hard eye, but that could have been because I had come out of that house.
==> I walked home. It was a little after half past five, dark, when I mounted the stoop and let myself in. I went to the kitchen, got a glass of milk, and asked Fritz, "Has he told you that we're off the hook?" <==
"No." He was inspecting carrots.
"Well, we are. Say anything you want to on the phone. Resume with your girl friends. If a stranger speaks to you, do as you please. Do you want some good advice?"
"Yes."
"Hit him for a raise. I am. By the way, I haven't asked you about the dinner last night. Did you feed them good?"
He leveled his eyes at me. "Archie, that is never to be mentioned. That terrible day. "Epouvantable." My mind was here with you. I don't know what I did, I don't know what was served. I will forget it if possible."

He said certainly, and I helped myself.
I was at my desk, making out checks to pay bills, when Wolfe came down from the plant rooms. Though he hadn't said so I knew he was as much on edge as I

 had been, and as he went to his desk I turned my head and said, "Relax. They got the gun."
"How do you know?"
==> I told him, beginning with the conversation with Cramer and ending with the conversation with Fritz. He asked if I had got a receipt for the photograph. <==
"No," I said, "he wasn't in a mood for signing receipts. I had told him that Althaus hadn't been killed by a G-man, and that hurt."
"No doubt. Will Mr. Wragg be at his office?" "He could be."
"Get him."
I turned and got the phone, but as I started to dial the doorbell rang. I cradled it and went to the hall for a look, turned, and said, "You can ask him for the receipt."
He took a breath. "Is he alone?"

I nodded. "But that crack about who Saul Panzer would lie for. Okay, I’ll file it. I don’t know any Max Maslow and have never heard the name before. The other two names with checkmarks?"
"Peter Jay. J-A-Y."
"Don’t know him and never heard of him." "Carl Heydt." He spelled it.
"That’s better. Couturier?"
"He makes clothes for women."
==> "Including a friend of mine, Miss Lily Rowan. I have gone with her a few times to his place to help her decide. His suits and dresses come high, but I suppose he’d turn out a little apron for three Cs." <==

How well do you know him?"
"Not well at all. I call him Carl, but you know how that is. We have been fellow weekend guests at Miss Rowan’s place in the country a couple of times. I have seen him only when I have been with Miss Rowan."
"Do you know why his name would be in Faber’s notebook with a checkmark?" "I don’t know and I couldn’t guess."
"Do you want me to connect Susan McLeod before I ask you about her?"

 she had soon regretted it. From the notebook: "Of course he knew I went to the farm weekends in the summer, and the very first weekend it was easy to see what his idea was. He thought it would be different on the farm than in town, it would be easy to get me to do what he wanted, as easy as falling off a log. The second week it was worse, and the third week it was still worse, and I was seeing what he was really like and I wished I hadn’t said I would marry him. He accused me of letting other men do what I wouldn’t let him do, and he tried to make me promise I wouldn’t date any other man, even for dinner or a show. Then the last week in July he seemed to get some sense, and I thought maybe he had just gone through some kind of a phase or something, but last week, Friday evening, he was worse than ever all of a sudden, and Sunday he told me he had told Archie Goodwin that I thought I was pregnant and he was responsible, and of course Archie would pass it on, and if I denied it no one would believe me, and the only thing to do was to get married right away. That was when I told him I’d like to kill him. Then the next day, Monday, Carl - Carl Heydt - told me that Ken had told him the same thing, and I suspected he had told two other men, on account of things they had said, and I decided to go there Tuesday and see him. I was going to tell him he had to tell Archie and Carl it was a lie, and anybody else he had told, and if I had to I’d get a lawyer."
If that was straight, and the part about Carl Heydt and Peter Jay and Max Maslow could be checked, that made it more like ten to one that she hadn’t killed him. She couldn’t have ad-libbed it; she would have had to go there intending to kill him, or at least bruise him, since she couldn’t have just happened to have with her a piece of two-inch pipe sixteen inches long. Say twenty to one. But if she hadn’t, who had? Better than twenty to one, not some thug. There had been eighty bucks in Ken’s pockets, and why would a thug go up that alley with the piece of pipe, much less hide under the platform with it? No. It had to be someone out for Ken specifically who knew that spot, or at least knew about it, and knew he would come there, and when.
Of course it was possible the murderer was someone Sue had never heard of and the motive had no connection with her, but that would make it really tough, and there she was, and Wolfe got all she had - or at least everything she would turn loose of. She didn’t know how many different men she had had dates with in the twenty months she had been modeling - maybe thirty. More in the first year than recently; she had thought it would help to get jobs if she knew a lot of men, and it had, but now she turned down as many jobs as she accepted. When she said she didn’t know why so many men wanted to date her Wolfe made a face, but I

==> she really meant it. It was hard to believe that a girl with so much born come-on actually wasn’t aware of it, but I knew her, and so did my friend Lily Rowan, who is an expert on women. <==
She didn’t know how many of them had asked her to marry them; maybe ten; she hadn’t kept count. Of course you don’t like her; to like a girl who says things like that, you’d have to see her and hear her, and if you’re a man you wouldn’t stop to ask whether you liked her or not. I frankly admit that the fact that she couldn’t dance had saved me a lot of wear and tear.
From the time she had met Ken Faber she had let up on dates, and in recent months she had let only three other men take her places. Those three had all asked her to marry them, and they had stuck to it in spite of Ken Faber. Carl Heydt, who had given her her first modeling job, was nearly twice her age, but that wouldn’t matter if she wanted to marry him when the time came. Peter Jay, who was something important in a big advertising agency, was younger, and Max Maslow, who was a fashion photographer, was still younger.
She had told Carl Heydt that what Ken had told him wasn’t true, but she wasn’t sure that he had believed her. She couldn’t remember exactly what Peter Jay and Max Maslow had said that made her think that Ken had told them too; she hadn’t had the suspicion until Monday, when Carl had told her what Ken had told him. She had told no one that she was going to Rusterman’s Tuesday to see Ken. All three of them knew about the corn delivery to Rusterman’s and Nero Wolfe; they knew she had made the deliveries for two summers and had kidded her about it; Peter Jay had tried to get her to pose in a cornfield, in an evening gown, for a client of his. They knew Ken was working at the farm and was making the deliveries. From the notebook, Wolfe speaking: "You know those men quite well. You know their temperaments and bents. If one of them, enraged beyond endurance by Mr. Faber’s conduct, went there and killed him, which one? Remembering it was not a sudden fit of passion, it was premeditated, planned. From your knowledge of them, which one?"
She was staring. "They didn’t."
"Not ‘they.’ One of them. Which?" She shook her head. "None of them."

OF ALL THE THOUSAND or more times I have felt like putting vinegar in Wolfe’s beer, I believe the closest I ever came to doing it was that Thursday evening when the doorbell rang at a quarter past nine, and after a look at the front I told him that Carl Heydt, Max Maslow, and Peter Jay were on the stoop, and he said they were not to be admitted.
In the nine and a half hours that had passed since Cramer had used my phone to call Purley Stebbins I had let it lie. I couldn’t expect Wolfe to start any fur flying until there was a reaction, or there wasn’t, say by tomorrow noon, to what had happened to Sue. However, I had made a move on my own. When Wolfe had left the office at four o’clock to go up to the plant rooms, I had told him I would be out on an errand for an hour or so, and I had taken a walk, to Rusterman’s, thinking I might pick up some little hint.
I didn’t. First I went out back for a look at the platform and the alley, which might seem screwy, since two days and nights had passed and the city scientists

 had combed it, but you never know. I once got an idea just running my eye around a hotel room where a woman had spent a night six months earlier. But I got nothing from the platform or alley except a scraped ear from squeezing under the platform and out again, and after talking with Felix and Joe and some of the kitchen staff I crossed it off. No one had seen or heard anyone or anything until Zoltan had stepped out for a cigarette (no smoking is allowed in the kitchen) and had seen the station wagon and the body on the ground.
==> I would have let it ride that evening, no needling until tomorrow noon. When Lily Rowan phoned around seven o’clock and said Sue had phoned her from the DA’s office that she was under arrest and had to have a lawyer and would Lily send her one, and Lily wanted me to come and tell her what was what, I would have gone if I hadn’t wanted to be on hand if there was a development. But when the development came Wolfe told me not to let it in. <==
I straight-eyed him. "You said you’d be concerned."
"I am concerned."
"Then here they are. You tossed her to the wolves to open them up, and here - "
"No. I did that to keep you out of jail. I am considering how to deal with the problem, and until I decide there is no point in seeing them. Tell them they’ll hear from us."
The doorbell rang again. "Then I’ll see them. In the front room." "No. Not in my house." He went back to his book.

ydt shook his head. "No, thanks. I’ll watch." "Okay. It’ll be simpler if you just relax, Goodwin."
I couldn’t turn and go, leaving my rear open. "I hope you won’t tickle," I said, backing up a step.
"Come in behind, Pete," Maslow said, and started, slow, his elbows out a little and his open hands extended and up some. Since he had been so neat with the kidney punch he probably knew a few tricks, maybe the armpit or the apple, and with Jay on my back I would have been a setup, so I doubled up and whirled, came up bumping Jay, and gave him the edge of my hand, as sharp as I could make it, on the side of his neck, the tendon below the ear. It got exactly the right spot and so much for him, but Maslow had my left wrist and was getting his shoulder in for the lock, and in another tenth of a second I would have been meat. The only way to go was down, and I went, sliding off his shoulder and bending my elbow into his belly, and he made a mistake. Having lost the lock, he reached for my other wrist. That opened him up, and I rolled into him, brought my right arm around, and had his neck with a knee in his back.
"Do you want to hear it crack?" I asked him, which was bad manners, since he couldn’t answer. I loosened my arm a little. "I admit I was lucky. If Jay had been sideways you would have had me." I looked at Jay, who was on a chair, rubbing his neck. "If you want to play games you ought to take lessons. Maslow would be a good teacher." I unwound my arm and got erect. "Don’t bother to see me out," I said and headed for the front.
==> I was still breathing a little fast when I emerged to the sidewalk, having straightened my tie and run my comb through my hair in the elevator. My watch said twenty past ten. Also in the elevator I had decided to make a phone call, so I walked to Madison Avenue, found a booth, and dialed one of the numbers I knew best. Miss Lily Rowan was in and would be pleased to have me come and tell her things, and I walked the twelve blocks to the number on 63rd Street where her penthouse occupies the roof. <==
Since it wasn’t one of Wolfe’s cases with a client involved, but a joint affair, and since it was Lily who had started Sue on her way at my request, I gave her the whole picture. Her chief reactions were a) that she didn’t blame Sue and I had no right to, I should feel flattered; b) that I had to somehow get Sue out of it without involving whoever had removed such a louse as Kenneth Faber from circulation;

 and c) that if I did have to involve him she hoped to heaven it wasn’t Carl Heydt because there was no one else around who could make clothes that were fit to wear, especially suits. She had sent a lawyer to Sue, Bernard Ross, and he had seen her and had phoned an hour before I came to report that she was being held without bail and he would decide in the morning whether to apply for a writ.
It was after one o’clock when I climbed out of a cab in front of the old brownstone on West 35th Street, mounted the stoop, used my key, went down the hall to the office and switched the light on, and got a surprise. Under a paperweight on my desk was a note in Wolfe’s handwriting. It said:
AG: Saul will take the car in the morning, probably for most of the day. His car is not presently available. NW

I went to the safe, manipulated the knob, opened the door, got the petty-cash book from the drawer, flipped to the current page, and saw an entry:

"By God. Talk about stubborn egos." Cramer shook his head. "That break you got on the carton. You know, any normal man, if he got a break like that, coming down just in the nick of time, what any normal man would do, he would go down on his knees and thank God. Do you know what you’ll do? You’ll thank you. I admit it would be a job for you to get down on your knees, but - "
The phone rang. I swiveled and got it, and a voice I recognized asked for Inspector Cramer. I turned and told him, "Purley Stebbins," and he came and took it. The conversation was even shorter than the one about the carton, and Cramer’s part was only a dozen words and a couple of growls. He hung up, went and got his hat, and headed for the hall, but a step short of the door he stopped and turned.
"I might as well tell you," he said. "It’ll give you a better appetite for dinner, even if it’s not corn. About an hour ago Duncan McLeod sat or stood or lay on a pile of dynamite and it went off. They’ve got his head and some other pieces. They’ll want to decide whether it was an accident or he did it. Maybe you can help them interpret the facts."
He turned and went.

She gave me a look. "You know you don’t want to. Let’s go outside."
I said it was cold, and she said she knew it and headed for the foyer. We got her wrap, a fur thing which she probably didn’t own, since top-flight models are offered loans of everything from socks to sable, went back in, on through, and out to the terrace. There were evergreens in tubs, and we crossed to them for shelter from the wind.
"You told Lily I hate you," she said. "I don’t."

"Of course not. I know. Of course not. I tell myself I’ll have to forget it ... but it’s not easy..." She shivered. "Anyway I wanted to say I don’t hate you. You don’t have to dance with me, and you know I’m not going to get married until I can stop working and have babies, and I know you never are, and even if you do it will be Lily, but you don’t have to stand there and let me really freeze, do you?"
I didn’t. You don’t have to be rude, even with a girl who can’t dance, and it was cold out there.

BLOOD WILL TELL
REX STOUT
NATURALLY MOST OF THE ITEMS in the mail that is delivered to the old brownstone on West 35th Street are addressed to Nero Wolfe, but since I both work and live there eight or ten out of a hundred are addressed to me. It is my custom to let my share wait until after I have opened Wolfe’s, looked it over, and put it on his desk, but sometimes curiosity butts in. As it did that Tuesday morning when I came to an elegant cream-colored envelope, outsize, addressed to me on a typewriter, with the return address in the corner engraved in dark brown:

"You leave it to me?"
"No. We'll discuss it later."
"There isn't much to discuss. No matter what we dig up about her, he'll probably -"
There were footsteps in the hall, and Fritz was at the door to announce dinner. Wolfe put the book down, stroked it with his fingertips, and rose.

==> That was Monday, February 24. Forty-two hours later, at one o'clock Wednesday, I had lunch with Susan Brooke at Lily Rowan's penthouse on 63rd Street between Madison and Park. <==
In the random assortment of facts Whipple had supplied there had been nothing to bite on. She had graduated from Radcliffe four or five years ago, and not long after had come to New York. She was living with her married brother, an electronics engineer, in his Park Avenue apartment, and so was her mother. They were from Wisconsin - Racine, Whipple thought, but wasn't sure. He didn't actually know that she was financially independent; he had assumed it, because for more than two years she had been working for the ROCC as a volunteer, no pay, and she had made cash contributions amounting to $2350. Not office work; she made contacts and arranged fund-raising parties and meetings.
That was about all Whipple knew, except for a couple of dozen useless little details and a few even more useless guesses.
The Lily Rowan idea was of course mine, since she was my friend, not Wolfe's. My first suggestion, Monday evening after dinner, was that I would phone the ROCC office, speak with the executive director, Thomas Henchy, and tell him that Wolfe was considering making a substantial contribution, that he would like to discuss it, and that in my opinion the best person to see him would be Miss

 Susan Brooke because I had heard that she made a good impression with men. That was vetoed by Wolfe on the ground (a) that he would feel committed to a substantial contribution, at least a grand, and (b) that with an attractive young woman I would get farther sooner if he wasn't present. Of course the real ground was that she was a woman. There are many things he likes about the old brownstone on West 35th Street, which he owns: the furniture and rugs and books and soundproofing; the plant rooms on the roof; Fritz Brenner, the chef; the big kitchen; Theodore Horstmann, the orchid nurse; and me, the man and the muscle. But what he likes best is that there is no woman in it, and it would suit him fine if one never crossed the doorsill.

So I suggested Lily Rowan, to whom a grand is peanuts, and that was satisfactory. When I rang her, that evening, she said she didn't like to discuss dirty work on the phone so I had better come in person, and I went, and got back to 35th Street and to bed at a quarter past two. Since I take a full eight hours short of murder, I didn't get to the office Tuesday morning until after Wolfe had come down from his two hours in the plant rooms - nine to eleven. Around noon Lily phoned. Miss Brooke would be there tomorrow for lunch at one o'clock, and I might come earlier for more briefing.
The two miles crosstown and up to 63rd Street is one of my favorite walks, but that Wednesday it took plenty of man and muscle. When it's twenty above and at every corner a snowy blast that has been practicing ever since it left Hudson Bay lowers your chin and clamps your mouth shut and bends you nearly double, you have to grit your teeth to go on by all the handy doors to shops and bars and hotel lobbies. When I finally made it, shook the snow off of my coat and hat under the canopy and in the lobby, took the elevator and left it at the top and pushed the button, and Lily opened the door, I said, "The nearest bed."
She raised a brow, a trick I taught her. "Try next door," she said. She let me by and shut the door. "You didn't walk!"

We linked arms and entered the living room, with its 19-by-34 Kashan rug, a garden pattern in seven colors, its Renoir and Manet and Cezanne, its off-white piano, and its glass doors to the terrace, where the wind was giving the snow a big play. When we sat she poked her feet out, the shins parallel, and muttered, "Antelope legs."

"In the first place," I said, "that was many years ago. In the second place, what I said was that you looked like an antelope in a herd of Guernseys. In a crowd you still do. We will now discuss Miss Brooke, though she probably won't make it in this weather."
==> But she did, only ten minutes late. Lily let the maid admit her but met her at the arch to the foyer. I stood in the middle of the Kashan and was introduced as Mr. Goodwin, her business adviser. <==
The description that Whipple had given us of her had been biased. She wasn't skinny. She was small, a couple of inches shorter than Lily, who came up to my nose, with smooth fair skin, brown hair and eyes, and hardly any lipstick on her wide full mouth. Her handshake was firm and friendly without overdoing it. Lily told me afterward that her brown woolen dress was probably Bergdorf, two hundred bucks. She didn't want a cocktail.
I left it to Lily. At lunch - mushroom chowder, lobster souffle, avocado salad, pineapple mousse - she stuck to ROCC: people, record, policy, program. Susan Brooke knew it all and knew how to tell it. It was a good pitch for almost anybody this side of Governor Wallace or Senator Eastland.
The question whether Lily should give her a check or stall was for Lily to decide, but the further question, whether to give it to her before getting personal or after, had been left to me.
Lily made her decision before we left the table; she rubbed her eye with her middle finger. Yes, on the check. I considered my question. Would she be a better quiz prospect while she was still wondering if she had made a sale, or after it was in the bag? My understanding of attractive young women wouldn't tell me, so I fingered in my pocket for a quarter, slipped it out, and glanced at it. Heads. I rubbed my left eye and saw that Lily got it.
Back in the living room, when coffee had been poured, Lily excused herself and left us. In a minute she returned, went to Miss Brooke, and handed her a little rectangle of blue paper.

"Many - many thanks, Miss Rowan, but of course they're not just from me, they're from all of us. Is it all right to list you as a patron?"

"In the first place," I said, "that was many years ago. In the second place, what I said was that you looked like an antelope in a herd of Guernseys. In a crowd you still do. We will now discuss Miss Brooke, though she probably won't make it in this weather."
But she did, only ten minutes late. Lily let the maid admit her but met her at the arch to the foyer. I stood in the middle of the Kashan and was introduced as Mr. Goodwin, her business adviser.
The description that Whipple had given us of her had been biased. She wasn't skinny. She was small, a couple of inches shorter than Lily, who came up to my nose, with smooth fair skin, brown hair and eyes, and hardly any lipstick on her wide full mouth. Her handshake was firm and friendly without overdoing it. Lily told me afterward that her brown woolen dress was probably Bergdorf, two hundred bucks. She didn't want a cocktail.
I left it to Lily. At lunch - mushroom chowder, lobster souffle, avocado salad, pineapple mousse - she stuck to ROCC: people, record, policy, program. Susan Brooke knew it all and knew how to tell it. It was a good pitch for almost anybody this side of Governor Wallace or Senator Eastland.
The question whether Lily should give her a check or stall was for Lily to decide, but the further question, whether to give it to her before getting personal or after, had been left to me.
==> Lily made her decision before we left the table; she rubbed her eye with her middle finger. Yes, on the check. I considered my question. Would she be a better quiz prospect while she was still wondering if she had made a sale, or after it was in the bag? My understanding of attractive young women wouldn't tell me, so I fingered in my pocket for a quarter, slipped it out, and glanced at it. Heads. I rubbed my left eye and saw that Lily got it. <==
Back in the living room, when coffee had been poured, Lily excused herself and left us. In a minute she returned, went to Miss Brooke, and handed her a little rectangle of blue paper.
"There," she said. "It won't get me into heaven, but it may help a little. Green pastures."

Susan Brooke looked at it - not just a glance, a full look. "The lovely lunch and this too," she said. She had a nice soft voice but ran her words together some. "Many - many thanks, Miss Rowan, but of course they're not just from me, they're from all of us. Is it all right to list you as a patron?"
Lily sat. "Certainly, if you want. My father made that money building sewers with one hand and playing politics with the other." She picked up her coffee cup and sipped. "Since you can afford to donate your time, I suppose your father knows how to make money too."

"No, Wisconsin."
"Oh. Omaha?"
Lily was showing me how smart she was. We had driven across Nebraska on the way to Montana. Miss Brooke politely didn't smile. "No, Racine," she said.

"No, of course not." She tapped her bag. "Your money isn't useless, Miss Rowan."
Lily flipped a hand. "Tax-deductible. But your time and energy aren't. Have you been doing this ever since you came to New York?"
"Oh no. Only two years - a little more. There's nothing fascinating about me, believe me. When I finished college - I barely made it, I'm Radcliffe 'fifty-nine - I went home to Racine and got good and bored. Then something happened, and - Anyway, my father was dead and only my mother and me in a big house, and we came to New York. My brother was here and he suggested it. But you didn't ask for my autobiography."
"Yes, I did. Practically. You live with your brother?"

She shook her head. "We did for a while, but then we took an apartment - my mother and I. And I got a job." She put her empty cup down, and I got up and filled it. I was glad of the chance to contribute something.
"If you can stand any more," Lily said, "what kind of a job?"

"I can stand it if you can. Reading manuscripts for a publisher. It was terrible - you would never believe what some people think is fit to print. Then I got a job at the UN, a desk job. The job was about as bad, but I met a lot of different people, and I realized how silly I was to do dull paying jobs when I didn't need the pay. It was a girl I met at the UN, a colored girl, who gave me the idea of the ROCC, and I went and asked if I could do something." She drank coffee.
"Absolutely fascinating," Lily declared. "Don't you think so, Mr. Goodwin?"
"No," I said flatly. A business adviser should be tough. "It depends on what satisfies a person, that's all. You ladies both have all the money you need, and in my opinion you're both rather selfish. You could make a couple of men secure and happy and comfortable, but you won't take the trouble. Neither of you is married. At least - you haven't been married, Miss Brooke?"
"No."
"And don't intend to be?"

She laughed, a soft little laugh. "Maybe I will. After what you've said, I'll feel selfish if I don't. I'll invite you and Miss Rowan to the wedding."
"I'll accept with pleasure. By the way, which publisher did you read manuscripts for? I had one rejected once, and it may have been you."

No flush or fluster. She even looked a little amused. "I hope," she said, "this isn't a new way of asking me if I'm a Communist."
"It isn't. I'm plain and simple. I would just say, are you?"
"And I would just say no. At first, when people tried to ask me if I was a Communist without really asking it I got indignant, but I soon saw that was silly. I handle it better now. Are you a Birchite, Mr. Goodwin?"
"I refuse to answer. I'm indignant."
She laughed a little. "You'll get over it. As for Dunbar Whipple, he's special. He's young and he has a lot to learn, but he'll be the first Negro mayor of New York City." She turned. "I warn you, Miss Rowan, some day I may ask you for a different kind of contribution - to the Whipple for Mayor campaign fund. Would you vote for a Negro?"
==> Lily said it would depend, that she voted for Democrats only, in respect to the memory of her father. I arose to pour coffee, but Miss Brooke looked at her watch and said she had an appointment. Lily gestured toward the terrace and said it was a day to ignore appointments, but Miss Brooke said she couldn't, it was a meeting about a school boycott. She gave Lily a healthy thank-you handshake, but not me, which was proper, since I hadn't said definitely that I wasn't a Birchite. As Lily convoyed her to the foyer I filled my cup and took it to the glass doors to admire the weather. <==
Lily came to join me. "Quite a gal," she said. "Fighting her way through that to talk school boycott. If she's fascinating, it's lucky for me I'm not."
"It's one of your best points," I said, "that you're not fascinating." I put the cup on a plant stand.
"And that I'm rather selfish. Look me in the eye, Escamillo. Take that back about making you secure and happy and comfortable."
"Not me. I merely said a man." "Name one."
"Nero Wolfe."

"Then two things. First, I don't think you'll get anything unless you invent it, and I know you wouldn't. I don't think there's anything to get - anything bad enough to count. Second, if there is, I hope you don't get it through anything you heard here. I couldn't blame you, but I would blame me. If she and that Negro want to get married they may be darned fools, of course I think they are, but it's their lookout. So do me a favor. If you stop it, and something you heard here got you started on what stops it, don't tell me. I don't want to know. That's me. You know?"
"Sure." I looked at my wrist: a quarter to three. "If I had any personal feelings about it they would be about the same as yours, but I haven't. Rights all over the place. She has a right to marry him. He has a right to marry her. The father and mother have a right to butt in, they've been doing it for ten thousand years. Nero

 Wolfe has a right to meet an obligation to a man. I have a right to earn my pay by doing what I'm told, providing it doesn't clash with my right to stay out of jail. So I'll run along and drop in at the office of the Parthenon Press, which is only a few blocks from here."
"There won't be anyone there. Look at that snow. I can beat you at gin. Don't they send people home?"
==> I looked. "They might at that. May I use the phone?" She was right. I got an answer, but not from the switchboard girl. Some man told me that everybody had gone. When I hung up Lily called through an open door, "I'm in here. Come on. I have a right to win enough to pay for the lunch." <==
She did, about.

That was a new experience. Over the years I have checked on a lot of people - a thousand, two thousand - but always after something specific, anything from an alibi to a motive for murder.
With Susan Brooke I was simply checking. Because I am interested in me, I would give two bits to know which I would have preferred, to dig up something that would brand her good, or to find nothing at all worth mentioning. At the time I was just doing a job, and enjoying it carefree because there was nothing at stake for Wolfe or me.
I spent three days, parts of them, and three evenings at it. It didn't take long to cross off the Parthenon Press lead. She hadn't done her reading at the office, and only three people, two editors and a stenographer, had known her. One of the editors hadn't liked her, but I gathered, from a remark by the stenographer, that he had made a pass at her and missed.

"I'll talk, son," Whipple told him. To Wolfe: "I know what you mean. I made him eat a little just now, on the way here. I felt I had to tell him what I asked you to do, and he wants to know what you said. You understand that he's - uh - overwrought. As you said, in distress. Of course I would like to know too, what you did. You understand that."
"Yes. I myself have done nothing." Wolfe leaned back, drew in air through his nose, all there was room for, which was plenty, and let it out through his mouth. "Archie. Tell them."
Dunbar blurted at me, "You're Archie Goodwin."
"Right." I moved my eyes to Whipple. "Did you tell him exactly what you asked Mr. Wolfe to do?"
"Yes. Exactly."
==> "Okay. A friend of mine named Lily Rowan invited Miss Brooke to lunch, and I was there. At lunch nothing was discussed but the ROCC. After lunch Miss Rowan gave Miss Brooke a check for a thousand dollars for the ROOC and asked her some questions about herself. Nothing cheeky, just the usual line. Miss Brooke mentioned that she had worked for the Parthenon Press and at the UN, <==

 and I spent three days checking that, mostly at the UN. I found nothing that you could use, and yesterday I took a plane to Chicago and drove to Racine, Wisconsin. At Racine I talked with two men who had known Miss Brooke and her family, a newspaperman and a private detective, and got no hint of anything you could use. You wanted to find out what was wrong with her. Correct?"
"Yes."
"I decided that there was nothing worth mentioning wrong with her and never had been. When I turned in at the hotel last night I intended to leave this morning, and at seven a.m. Mr. Wolfe phoned and told me what had happened, and I left right away and returned to New York. Any questions?"
Dunbar moved. On his feet, peering down at me, his shoulders hunched, he looked like Sugar Ray starting the tenth round, not ending it. "You're lying," he said, not blurting. "You're covering up, I don't know what, but I'm going to. You know who killed her." He wheeled to Wolfe.

Fifty hours went by.
Like you and everyone else, I have various sources of information about what goes on: newspapers, magazines, radio, television, taxicab drivers, random talk here and there, friends, and enemies. I also have two special ones: Lon Cohen, confidential assistant to the publisher of the Gazette, and a woman who is on intimate terms, not familial, with a certain highly distinguished citizen, for whom I once did a big favor. But the news of the arrest of Dunbar Whipple came from none of those sources; it came from Inspector Cramer of Homicide South, whom I couldn't exactly call an enemy and wouldn't presume to call a friend.
During the two days I had not only read the newspapers but had also phoned Lon Cohen a couple of times to ask if there was anything hot about the Susan Brooke murder that wasn't being printed. There wasn't, unless you would call it hot that her brother Kenneth had socked an assistant district attorney on the beak, or that there was nothing to the rumor that it was being hushed up that she had been pregnant. She hadn't been. Of course a lot was being printed: that her handbag, on a table in the apartment, had had more than a hundred dollars in it; that an expensive gold pin had been on her dress and a ring with a big emerald had been on her finger (I had seen the ring); that she had bought a bottle of wine at a package store, and several items at a delicatessen, shortly before eight o'clock; that her mother was prostrated and inaccessible; that everyone at the ROCC had been or was being questioned; and so on. The News came out ahead on shots of Susan Brooke, with one in a bikini on a Puerto Rico beach, but the Gazette had the best one of Dunbar Whipple. Handsome and jaunty.
I wasn't surprised when, at 6:03 Thursday afternoon, Inspector Cramer showed. I

==>  had been expecting him or Sergeant Purley Stebbins, or at least a phone call, since Wednesday noon, when Lily Rowan had phoned to tell me she had had an official caller. Of course they had done a routine check on Susan Brooke's recent activities, of course someone at the ROCC had told them about her lunch with Miss Lily Rowan and Lily's contribution to the cause, of course they had called on Miss Rowan, and of course Lily had told the caller about me, since someone else would - for instance, the hallman - if she didn't. So I had been expecting company, and when the doorbell rang and I saw Cramer's burly figure and round red face and battered old felt hat on the stoop, I went and opened up and said, peeved, "You took your time. We've been expecting you for days." <==
He spoke to me as he entered. Sometimes he doesn't; he just tramps down the hall. The fact that he spoke, and even thanked me for taking his hat and coat, showed that he had come not to claim but to ask. When he entered the office, naturally he didn't offer a hand, since he knows that Wolfe is not a shaker, but before he lowered his fanny onto the red leather chair he uttered a polite greeting and actually made a try at being sociable by asking, "And how are the orchids?"
Wolfe's brows went up. "Passable, thank you. A pot of Miltonia roezli has fourteen scapes."
"Is that so." Cramer sat and pulled his feet in. "Busy? Am I interrupting something?"
"No, sir."
"No case and no client?"

"I haven't said I do."
"Nuts." I tapped the milk carton. "This says it. Getting me here the way you did says it. Why?"
He left the chair and moved. He tiptoed to the door, smooth and silent considering his age and bulk, jerked the door open, and stuck his head out. Evidently he wasn't as sure he was loose as I was that I was. He shut the door and went to the bathroom, and I heard water spurting from a faucet, and in a minute he came with a glass of water. He drank it, in no hurry, put the glass on the table, sat, and narrowed his eyes at me.
"I've been a cop for thirty-six years," he said, "and this is the first time I've ever passed the buck to an outsider."
I had my eyes smile a little. "I'm flattered. Or Mr. Wolfe is."
==> "Balls. He wouldn't know flattery if it had labels pasted all over it, and neither would you. Goodwin, I'm going to tell you something that's for you and Wolfe, and that's "all". No Lou Cohen or Saul Panzer or Lily Rowan. Is that understood?" <==
"I don't know why you drag in Miss Rowan, she's merely a personal friend. And there's no point in telling me something if we can't use it."
"You'll use it all right. But it did "not" come from me. Never, to anybody."
"Okay. Mr. Wolfe isn't here to cinch it by giving you his word of honor, so I'll do it for him. For us. Our word of honor."

"I could, yes. Are you a newspaper reporter? Is this a trick?"
"No. If I were this would be pretty dumb, you'd only have me bounced. I'm Archie Goodwin."
"But I don't..." Long pause. "Very well. The hallman will ask you for identification."
I told her of course, and hung up before she could change her mind.
When leaving the house I had decided that I would completely iguore the tail question, but I couldn't help it if my eyes, while scouting the street for an empty taxi, took notice of standing vehicles. However, when I was in and rolling, up Madison Avenue and then Park, I kept facing front. To hell with the rear.
==> It was a regulation Park Avenue hive in the Eighties - marquee, doorman hopping out when the taxi stopped, rubber runner saving the rug in the lobby - but it was Grade A, because the doorman did not double as hallman. When I showed the hallman, who was expecting me, my private investigator license he gave it a good look, handed it back, and told me 10B, and I went to the elevator. On the tenth floor I was admitted by a uniformed female who took my hat and coat, put them in a closet, and conducted me through an arch into a room even bigger than Lily Rowan's, where twenty couples can dance. I have a test for people with rooms that big - not the rugs or the furniture or the drapes, but the pictures on the walls. If I can tell what they are, okay. If all I can do is guess, look out; these people will bear watching. That room passed the test fine. I was <==

 looking at a canvas showing three girls sitting on the grass under a tree when footsteps came and I turned. She approached. She didn't offer a hand, but she said in a low, soft voice, "Mr. Goodwin? I'm Ivana Althaus," and moved to a chair.
Even without the picture test I would have passed her - her small slender figure with its honest angles, her hair with its honest gray, her eyes with their honest doubt. As I turned a chair to sit facing her I decided to be as honest as possible. She was saying that Miss Hinckley would come soon, but she would prefer not to wait. She had understood me to say on the phone that her son had been killed by an agent of the FBI. Was that correct?
Her eyes were straight at me, and I met them. "Not strictly," I told her. "I said that someone told Mr. Wolfe that. I should explain about Mr. Wolfe. He is - uh - eccentric, and he has certain strong feelings about the New York Police Department. He resents their attitude toward him and his work, and he thinks they interfere too much. He reads the newspapers, and especially news about murders, and a couple of weeks ago he got the idea that the police and the District Attorney were letting go on the murder of your son, and when he learned that your son had been collecting material for an article about the FBI he suspected that the letting go might be deliberate. If so, it might be a chance to give the police a black eye, and nothing would please him better."
Her eyes were staying straight at me, hardly a blink. "So," I said, "we had no case on our hands, and he started some inquiries. One thing we learned, a fact that hasn't been published, was that nothing about the FBI, no notes or documents, was found by the police in your son s apartment. Perhaps you knew that."

*** Bold lover, ever, ever shalt thou kiss,
And win the willing goal, and never leave;
She will not fade, and Thou shalt have they bliss,

Forever wilt thou love, and she be fair ***
==> I haven't read all the poetry in the world, but Lily Rowan has a shelf of it and on certain occasions wants me to read some aloud to her, and I was pretty sure I had read that, but there was something wrong with it. I tried to place it but couldn't. Anyway, the point was, who had written it? Not Althaus; I had seen his hand on various items. Sarah Dacos? If so, I had something. I had plenty. I put it on top of the chest and spent another hour looking, but drew a blank. <==
I had promised Mrs. Althaus I would take nothing without her permission, but I was tempted. I could take the photograph, not out of the house, but just one flight down, knock at Sarah Dacos's door, and if she was there, as she might be on a Saturday, display it and ask her, "Did you write that?" It was a real temptation, so quick and direct. But it was too damned direct. I would have to stick to the roundabout. I left the apartment and the house, found a phone booth, dialed Mrs. Bruner's number and got her, and told her I wanted to come and ask her something. She said she would be there until one o'clock. It was only twenty past twelve. I went out and got a taxi.
She was in her office, at her desk with some papers, expecting me. She asked if Miss Dacos had come as arranged, saying she had rather expected her to phone, but she hadn't. I said yes, she had come, and had been very cooperative. I emphasized the "very," since it was possible that the room was bugged. Then I sat, leaned forward to her, and whispered, "Do you mind if we whisper?"
She frowned. "It is so ridiculous!"
"Yes," I whispered, "but it's safe. You don't need to say much. I only want a sample of Miss Dacos's handwriting. Anything - a memo, a note to you. I know this seems even more ridiculous, but it isn't. Don't ask me to explain because I can't. I'm following instructions. Either you trust Mr. Wolfe to do the job and do it right or you don't."
"But why on earth - " she began, but I showed her a palm.

It was five minutes to two when I put my hat and coat on the rack in the hall, went to the door of the dining room, told Wolfe, who was at the table, that it looked and felt like snow, and proceeded to the kitchen. I don't join Wolfe when

 I arrive in the middle of a meal; we agree that for one man to hurry with meat or fish while the other dawdles with pastry or cheese is bad for the atmosphere. Fritz put things on my breakfast table and brought what was left of the baked bluefish, and I asked him how he was getting on with the menu for next Thursday's blowout.
"I'm not discussing that," he said. "I am not discussing anything, Archie. He was in my room for more than an hour before lunch, talking with the television on loud. If it is so dangerous I will not talk at all."
I told him we should be back to normal by the time the shad roe started coming, and he threw up his hands and said good God in French.
==> When I finished and went to the office Wolfe was standing over by the globe, turning it and scowling at it. The man who gave him that globe, the biggest one I have ever seen, couldn't have known what a big help it would be. Whenever a situation gets so ticklish that he wishes he were somewhere else, he can walk over to the globe and pick spots to go to. Wonderful. As I entered he asked if I had anything, and when I nodded he went to his desk and I turned on the radio, took a yellow chair around near his elbow, and reported. It didn't take long, since there had been no conversation to speak of, just the action. I didn't mention the phone call to Lily Rowan because it had been purely personal. Having read the poetry twice, he handed the photograph back to me and said she had an ear for meter. <==
"I told you she wasn't a sap," I said. "Pretty neat, doing that with the last four lines of the second stanza of Keats's 'Ode on a Grecian Urn.'"
His eyes narrowed at me. "How the deuce do you know that? You don't read Keats."
I shrugged. "Back in Ohio in my boyhood days. As you know, I have quite a memory. I don't brag about that, but I have a brag coming about this." I tapped the photograph. "We know why she lied. She's involved. Possibly not too deep; it could be that she merely didn't want to admit she was close with him, close enough for him to tell her about the FBI. Or possibly "very" deep. 'Ever, ever shalt thou kiss.' And 'Forever wilt thou love.' But he told her he was going to marry another girl, so she shot him, probably with his own gun. The second alternative, which we prefer by far. It would be hard to nail her. She might be

 able to prove she was at that lecture but not what time she left. Possibly she wasn't there at all. She spent the evening at Sixty-three Arbor Street, having it out with the bold lover, and she shot him before the G-men arrived. Does that appeal to you?"

"Don’t know him and never heard of him." "Carl Heydt." He spelled it.
"That’s better. Couturier?"

"Not well at all. I call him Carl, but you know how that is. We have been fellow weekend guests at Miss Rowan’s place in the country a couple of times. I have seen him only when I have been with Miss Rowan."
"Do you know why his name would be in Faber’s notebook with a checkmark?" "I don’t know and I couldn’t guess."

"That’s better. Couturier?"
"He makes clothes for women."
"Including a friend of mine, Miss Lily Rowan. I have gone with her a few times to his place to help her decide. His suits and dresses come high, but I suppose he’d turn out a little apron for three Cs."

How well do you know him?"
==> "Not well at all. I call him Carl, but you know how that is. We have been fellow weekend guests at Miss Rowan’s place in the country a couple of times. I have seen him only when I have been with Miss Rowan." <==
"Do you know why his name would be in Faber’s notebook with a checkmark?" "I don’t know and I couldn’t guess."
"Do you want me to connect Susan McLeod before I ask you about her?"
I had supposed that would be coming as soon as I heard the name Carl Heydt, since the cops had had the notebook for four hours and had certainly lost no time making contacts. Saving me for the last, and Cramer himself coming, was of course a compliment, but more for Wolfe than for me.
"No, thanks," I told him. "I’ll do the connecting. The first time Kenneth Faber came with the corn, six weeks ago today, the first time I ever saw him, he told me Sue McLeod had got her father to give him a job on the farm. He was very chatty. He said he was a freelance cartoonist, and the cartoon business was in a slump, and he wanted some sun and air and his muscles needed exercise, and Sue often spent weekends at the farm and that would be nice. You can’t beat that for a connection. Go ahead and ask me about Susan McLeod."
Cramer was eying me. "You’re never slow, are you, Goodwin?"

"Then you know how she looks, and much obliged for the compliment. She has points. I think she means well, and she can’t help it if she can’t keep the come- on from showing because she was born with it. She didn’t pick her eyes and voice, they came in the package. Her talk is something special. Not only do you never know what she will say next; she doesn’t know herself. One evening I kissed her, a good healthy kiss, and when we broke she said, ‘I saw a horse kiss a cow once.’ But she’s a lousy dancer, and after a show or prize fight or ball game I want an hour or two with a band and a partner. So I haven’t seen much of her for a year. The last time I saw her was at a party somewhere a couple of weeks ago. I don’t know who her escort was, but it wasn’t me. As for my being intimate with her, meaning what you mean, what do you expect? I haven’t, but even if I had I’m certainly not intimate enough with you to blab it. Anything else?"
"Plenty. You got her a job with that Carl Heydt. You found her a place to live, an apartment that happens to be only six blocks from here."
I cocked my head at him. "Where did you get that? From Carl Heydt?" "No. From her."
==> "She didn’t mention Miss Rowan?" <==
"No."
"Then I give her a mark. You were at her about a murder, and she didn’t want to drag in Miss Rowan. One day, the second summer she was bringing the corn, two years ago, she said she wanted a job in New York and asked if I could get her one. I doubted if she could hold a job any friend of mine might have open or might make room for, so I consulted Miss Rowan, and she took it on. She got two girls she knew to share their apartment with Sue - it’s only five blocks from here, not six - she paid for a course at the Midtown Studio - Sue has paid her back - and she got Carl Heydt to give Sue a tryout at modeling. I understand that Sue is now one of the ten most popular models in New York and her price is a hundred dollars an hour, but that’s hearsay. I haven’t seen her on a magazine cover. I didn’t get her a job or a place to live. I know Miss Rowan better than Sue does; she won’t mind my dragging her in. Anything else?"
"Plenty. When and how did you find out that Kenneth Faber had shoved you out and taken Sue over?"

"Nuts." I turned to Wolfe. "Your Honor, I object to the question on the ground that it is insulting, impertinent, and disgusticulous. It assumes not only that I am shovable but also that I can be shoved out of a place I have never been."
"Objection sustained." A corner of Wolfe’s mouth was up a little. "You will rephrase the question, Mr. Cramer."

 she had soon regretted it. From the notebook: "Of course he knew I went to the farm weekends in the summer, and the very first weekend it was easy to see what his idea was. He thought it would be different on the farm than in town, it would be easy to get me to do what he wanted, as easy as falling off a log. The second week it was worse, and the third week it was still worse, and I was seeing what he was really like and I wished I hadn’t said I would marry him. He accused me of letting other men do what I wouldn’t let him do, and he tried to make me promise I wouldn’t date any other man, even for dinner or a show. Then the last week in July he seemed to get some sense, and I thought maybe he had just gone through some kind of a phase or something, but last week, Friday evening, he was worse than ever all of a sudden, and Sunday he told me he had told Archie Goodwin that I thought I was pregnant and he was responsible, and of course Archie would pass it on, and if I denied it no one would believe me, and the only thing to do was to get married right away. That was when I told him I’d like to kill him. Then the next day, Monday, Carl - Carl Heydt - told me that Ken had told him the same thing, and I suspected he had told two other men, on account of things they had said, and I decided to go there Tuesday and see him. I was going to tell him he had to tell Archie and Carl it was a lie, and anybody else he had told, and if I had to I’d get a lawyer."
If that was straight, and the part about Carl Heydt and Peter Jay and Max Maslow could be checked, that made it more like ten to one that she hadn’t killed him. She couldn’t have ad-libbed it; she would have had to go there intending to kill him, or at least bruise him, since she couldn’t have just happened to have with her a piece of two-inch pipe sixteen inches long. Say twenty to one. But if she hadn’t, who had? Better than twenty to one, not some thug. There had been eighty bucks in Ken’s pockets, and why would a thug go up that alley with the piece of pipe, much less hide under the platform with it? No. It had to be someone out for Ken specifically who knew that spot, or at least knew about it, and knew he would come there, and when.
Of course it was possible the murderer was someone Sue had never heard of and the motive had no connection with her, but that would make it really tough, and there she was, and Wolfe got all she had - or at least everything she would turn loose of. She didn’t know how many different men she had had dates with in the twenty months she had been modeling - maybe thirty. More in the first year than recently; she had thought it would help to get jobs if she knew a lot of men, and it had, but now she turned down as many jobs as she accepted. When she said she didn’t know why so many men wanted to date her Wolfe made a face, but I

==> she really meant it. It was hard to believe that a girl with so much born come-on actually wasn’t aware of it, but I knew her, and so did my friend Lily Rowan, who is an expert on women. <==
She didn’t know how many of them had asked her to marry them; maybe ten; she hadn’t kept count. Of course you don’t like her; to like a girl who says things like that, you’d have to see her and hear her, and if you’re a man you wouldn’t stop to ask whether you liked her or not. I frankly admit that the fact that she couldn’t dance had saved me a lot of wear and tear.
From the time she had met Ken Faber she had let up on dates, and in recent months she had let only three other men take her places. Those three had all asked her to marry them, and they had stuck to it in spite of Ken Faber. Carl Heydt, who had given her her first modeling job, was nearly twice her age, but that wouldn’t matter if she wanted to marry him when the time came. Peter Jay, who was something important in a big advertising agency, was younger, and Max Maslow, who was a fashion photographer, was still younger.
She had told Carl Heydt that what Ken had told him wasn’t true, but she wasn’t sure that he had believed her. She couldn’t remember exactly what Peter Jay and Max Maslow had said that made her think that Ken had told them too; she hadn’t had the suspicion until Monday, when Carl had told her what Ken had told him. She had told no one that she was going to Rusterman’s Tuesday to see Ken. All three of them knew about the corn delivery to Rusterman’s and Nero Wolfe; they knew she had made the deliveries for two summers and had kidded her about it; Peter Jay had tried to get her to pose in a cornfield, in an evening gown, for a client of his. They knew Ken was working at the farm and was making the deliveries. From the notebook, Wolfe speaking: "You know those men quite well. You know their temperaments and bents. If one of them, enraged beyond endurance by Mr. Faber’s conduct, went there and killed him, which one? Remembering it was not a sudden fit of passion, it was premeditated, planned. From your knowledge of them, which one?"
She was staring. "They didn’t."
"Not ‘they.’ One of them. Which?" She shook her head. "None of them."

OF ALL THE THOUSAND or more times I have felt like putting vinegar in Wolfe’s beer, I believe the closest I ever came to doing it was that Thursday evening when the doorbell rang at a quarter past nine, and after a look at the front I told him that Carl Heydt, Max Maslow, and Peter Jay were on the stoop, and he said they were not to be admitted.
In the nine and a half hours that had passed since Cramer had used my phone to call Purley Stebbins I had let it lie. I couldn’t expect Wolfe to start any fur flying until there was a reaction, or there wasn’t, say by tomorrow noon, to what had happened to Sue. However, I had made a move on my own. When Wolfe had left the office at four o’clock to go up to the plant rooms, I had told him I would be out on an errand for an hour or so, and I had taken a walk, to Rusterman’s, thinking I might pick up some little hint.
I didn’t. First I went out back for a look at the platform and the alley, which might seem screwy, since two days and nights had passed and the city scientists

 had combed it, but you never know. I once got an idea just running my eye around a hotel room where a woman had spent a night six months earlier. But I got nothing from the platform or alley except a scraped ear from squeezing under the platform and out again, and after talking with Felix and Joe and some of the kitchen staff I crossed it off. No one had seen or heard anyone or anything until Zoltan had stepped out for a cigarette (no smoking is allowed in the kitchen) and had seen the station wagon and the body on the ground.
==> I would have let it ride that evening, no needling until tomorrow noon. When Lily Rowan phoned around seven o’clock and said Sue had phoned her from the DA’s office that she was under arrest and had to have a lawyer and would Lily send her one, and Lily wanted me to come and tell her what was what, I would have gone if I hadn’t wanted to be on hand if there was a development. But when the development came Wolfe told me not to let it in. <==
I straight-eyed him. "You said you’d be concerned."
"I am concerned."
"Then here they are. You tossed her to the wolves to open them up, and here - "
"No. I did that to keep you out of jail. I am considering how to deal with the problem, and until I decide there is no point in seeing them. Tell them they’ll hear from us."
The doorbell rang again. "Then I’ll see them. In the front room." "No. Not in my house." He went back to his book.

ydt shook his head. "No, thanks. I’ll watch." "Okay. It’ll be simpler if you just relax, Goodwin."
I couldn’t turn and go, leaving my rear open. "I hope you won’t tickle," I said, backing up a step.
"Come in behind, Pete," Maslow said, and started, slow, his elbows out a little and his open hands extended and up some. Since he had been so neat with the kidney punch he probably knew a few tricks, maybe the armpit or the apple, and with Jay on my back I would have been a setup, so I doubled up and whirled, came up bumping Jay, and gave him the edge of my hand, as sharp as I could make it, on the side of his neck, the tendon below the ear. It got exactly the right spot and so much for him, but Maslow had my left wrist and was getting his shoulder in for the lock, and in another tenth of a second I would have been meat. The only way to go was down, and I went, sliding off his shoulder and bending my elbow into his belly, and he made a mistake. Having lost the lock, he reached for my other wrist. That opened him up, and I rolled into him, brought my right arm around, and had his neck with a knee in his back.
"Do you want to hear it crack?" I asked him, which was bad manners, since he couldn’t answer. I loosened my arm a little. "I admit I was lucky. If Jay had been sideways you would have had me." I looked at Jay, who was on a chair, rubbing his neck. "If you want to play games you ought to take lessons. Maslow would be a good teacher." I unwound my arm and got erect. "Don’t bother to see me out," I said and headed for the front.
==> I was still breathing a little fast when I emerged to the sidewalk, having straightened my tie and run my comb through my hair in the elevator. My watch said twenty past ten. Also in the elevator I had decided to make a phone call, so I walked to Madison Avenue, found a booth, and dialed one of the numbers I knew best. Miss Lily Rowan was in and would be pleased to have me come and tell her things, and I walked the twelve blocks to the number on 63rd Street where her penthouse occupies the roof. <==
Since it wasn’t one of Wolfe’s cases with a client involved, but a joint affair, and since it was Lily who had started Sue on her way at my request, I gave her the whole picture. Her chief reactions were a) that she didn’t blame Sue and I had no right to, I should feel flattered; b) that I had to somehow get Sue out of it without involving whoever had removed such a louse as Kenneth Faber from circulation;

 and c) that if I did have to involve him she hoped to heaven it wasn’t Carl Heydt because there was no one else around who could make clothes that were fit to wear, especially suits. She had sent a lawyer to Sue, Bernard Ross, and he had seen her and had phoned an hour before I came to report that she was being held without bail and he would decide in the morning whether to apply for a writ.
It was after one o’clock when I climbed out of a cab in front of the old brownstone on West 35th Street, mounted the stoop, used my key, went down the hall to the office and switched the light on, and got a surprise. Under a paperweight on my desk was a note in Wolfe’s handwriting. It said:
AG: Saul will take the car in the morning, probably for most of the day. His car is not presently available. NW

"By God. Talk about stubborn egos." Cramer shook his head. "That break you got on the carton. You know, any normal man, if he got a break like that, coming down just in the nick of time, what any normal man would do, he would go down on his knees and thank God. Do you know what you’ll do? You’ll thank you. I admit it would be a job for you to get down on your knees, but - "
The phone rang. I swiveled and got it, and a voice I recognized asked for Inspector Cramer. I turned and told him, "Purley Stebbins," and he came and took it. The conversation was even shorter than the one about the carton, and Cramer’s part was only a dozen words and a couple of growls. He hung up, went and got his hat, and headed for the hall, but a step short of the door he stopped and turned.
"I might as well tell you," he said. "It’ll give you a better appetite for dinner, even if it’s not corn. About an hour ago Duncan McLeod sat or stood or lay on a pile of dynamite and it went off. They’ve got his head and some other pieces. They’ll want to decide whether it was an accident or he did it. Maybe you can help them interpret the facts."
He turned and went.
< class="sgc48" id="heading_id_107
==> ONE DAY LAST WEEK there was a party at Lily Rowan’s penthouse. She never invites more than six to dinner - eight counting her and me - but that was a dancing party and around coffee time a dozen more came and three musicians <==

 got set in the alcove and started up. After rounds with Lily and three or four others, I approached Sue McLeod and offered a hand.
She gave me a look. "You know you don’t want to. Let’s go outside."
I said it was cold, and she said she knew it and headed for the foyer. We got her wrap, a fur thing which she probably didn’t own, since top-flight models are offered loans of everything from socks to sable, went back in, on through, and out to the terrace. There were evergreens in tubs, and we crossed to them for shelter from the wind.
"You told Lily I hate you," she said. "I don’t."

"You leave it to me?"
"No. We'll discuss it later."
"There isn't much to discuss. No matter what we dig up about her, he'll probably -"
There were footsteps in the hall, and Fritz was at the door to announce dinner. Wolfe put the book down, stroked it with his fingertips, and rose.

==> That was Monday, February 24. Forty-two hours later, at one o'clock Wednesday, I had lunch with Susan Brooke at Lily Rowan's penthouse on 63rd Street between Madison and Park. <==
In the random assortment of facts Whipple had supplied there had been nothing to bite on. She had graduated from Radcliffe four or five years ago, and not long after had come to New York. She was living with her married brother, an electronics engineer, in his Park Avenue apartment, and so was her mother. They were from Wisconsin - Racine, Whipple thought, but wasn't sure. He didn't actually know that she was financially independent; he had assumed it, because for more than two years she had been working for the ROCC as a volunteer, no pay, and she had made cash contributions amounting to $2350. Not office work; she made contacts and arranged fund-raising parties and meetings.
That was about all Whipple knew, except for a couple of dozen useless little details and a few even more useless guesses.
The Lily Rowan idea was of course mine, since she was my friend, not Wolfe's. My first suggestion, Monday evening after dinner, was that I would phone the ROCC office, speak with the executive director, Thomas Henchy, and tell him that Wolfe was considering making a substantial contribution, that he would like to discuss it, and that in my opinion the best person to see him would be Miss

 Susan Brooke because I had heard that she made a good impression with men. That was vetoed by Wolfe on the ground (a) that he would feel committed to a substantial contribution, at least a grand, and (b) that with an attractive young woman I would get farther sooner if he wasn't present. Of course the real ground was that she was a woman. There are many things he likes about the old brownstone on West 35th Street, which he owns: the furniture and rugs and books and soundproofing; the plant rooms on the roof; Fritz Brenner, the chef; the big kitchen; Theodore Horstmann, the orchid nurse; and me, the man and the muscle. But what he likes best is that there is no woman in it, and it would suit him fine if one never crossed the doorsill.

So I suggested Lily Rowan, to whom a grand is peanuts, and that was satisfactory. When I rang her, that evening, she said she didn't like to discuss dirty work on the phone so I had better come in person, and I went, and got back to 35th Street and to bed at a quarter past two. Since I take a full eight hours short of murder, I didn't get to the office Tuesday morning until after Wolfe had come down from his two hours in the plant rooms - nine to eleven. Around noon Lily phoned. Miss Brooke would be there tomorrow for lunch at one o'clock, and I might come earlier for more briefing.
The two miles crosstown and up to 63rd Street is one of my favorite walks, but that Wednesday it took plenty of man and muscle. When it's twenty above and at every corner a snowy blast that has been practicing ever since it left Hudson Bay lowers your chin and clamps your mouth shut and bends you nearly double, you have to grit your teeth to go on by all the handy doors to shops and bars and hotel lobbies. When I finally made it, shook the snow off of my coat and hat under the canopy and in the lobby, took the elevator and left it at the top and pushed the button, and Lily opened the door, I said, "The nearest bed."
She raised a brow, a trick I taught her. "Try next door," she said. She let me by and shut the door. "You didn't walk!"

We linked arms and entered the living room, with its 19-by-34 Kashan rug, a garden pattern in seven colors, its Renoir and Manet and Cezanne, its off-white piano, and its glass doors to the terrace, where the wind was giving the snow a big play. When we sat she poked her feet out, the shins parallel, and muttered, "Antelope legs."

The question whether Lily should give her a check or stall was for Lily to decide, but the further question, whether to give it to her before getting personal or after, had been left to me.
Lily made her decision before we left the table; she rubbed her eye with her middle finger. Yes, on the check. I considered my question. Would she be a better quiz prospect while she was still wondering if she had made a sale, or after it was in the bag? My understanding of attractive young women wouldn't tell me, so I fingered in my pocket for a quarter, slipped it out, and glanced at it. Heads. I rubbed my left eye and saw that Lily got it.
Back in the living room, when coffee had been poured, Lily excused herself and left us. In a minute she returned, went to Miss Brooke, and handed her a little rectangle of blue paper.
"There," she said. "It won't get me into heaven, but it may help a little. Green pastures."

==> Susan Brooke looked at it - not just a glance, a full look. "The lovely lunch and this too," she said. She had a nice soft voice but ran her words together some. "Many - many thanks, Miss Rowan, but of course they're not just from me, they're from all of us. Is it all right to list you as a patron?" <==
Lily sat. "Certainly, if you want. My father made that money building sewers with one hand and playing politics with the other." She picked up her coffee cup and sipped. "Since you can afford to donate your time, I suppose your father knows how to make money too."
"Yes, he did." She closed her bag with the check inside. "Not building sewers, real estate. He died six years ago."
"In New York?"
"No, Wisconsin."
"Oh. Omaha?"

"In New York?"
"No, Wisconsin."
"Oh. Omaha?"
Lily was showing me how smart she was. We had driven across Nebraska on the way to Montana. Miss Brooke politely didn't smile. "No, Racine," she said.
Lily sipped coffee. "I suppose I'm being nosy, but to me it's - well, you're fascinating. I'm not lazy or stingy, I'm merely useless. I simply don't understand you. Do you mind if I try to?"
==> "No, of course not." She tapped her bag. "Your money isn't useless, Miss Rowan." <==
Lily flipped a hand. "Tax-deductible. But your time and energy aren't. Have you been doing this ever since you came to New York?"
"Oh no. Only two years - a little more. There's nothing fascinating about me, believe me. When I finished college - I barely made it, I'm Radcliffe 'fifty-nine - I went home to Racine and got good and bored. Then something happened, and - Anyway, my father was dead and only my mother and me in a big house, and we came to New York. My brother was here and he suggested it. But you didn't ask for my autobiography."
"Yes, I did. Practically. You live with your brother?"

She shook her head. "We did for a while, but then we took an apartment - my mother and I. And I got a job." She put her empty cup down, and I got up and filled it. I was glad of the chance to contribute something.

"I can stand it if you can. Reading manuscripts for a publisher. It was terrible - you would never believe what some people think is fit to print. Then I got a job at the UN, a desk job. The job was about as bad, but I met a lot of different people, and I realized how silly I was to do dull paying jobs when I didn't need the pay. It was a girl I met at the UN, a colored girl, who gave me the idea of the ROCC, and I went and asked if I could do something." She drank coffee.
"Absolutely fascinating," Lily declared. "Don't you think so, Mr. Goodwin?"
"No," I said flatly. A business adviser should be tough. "It depends on what satisfies a person, that's all. You ladies both have all the money you need, and in my opinion you're both rather selfish. You could make a couple of men secure and happy and comfortable, but you won't take the trouble. Neither of you is married. At least - you haven't been married, Miss Brooke?"
"No."
"And don't intend to be?"
==> She laughed, a soft little laugh. "Maybe I will. After what you've said, I'll feel selfish if I don't. I'll invite you and Miss Rowan to the wedding." <==
"I'll accept with pleasure. By the way, which publisher did you read manuscripts for? I had one rejected once, and it may have been you."
"Oh, I hope not. The Parthenon Press."
"Then it wasn't you. Another by the way, this will amuse you. When Miss Rowan got the idea of making a contribution to the ROCC she asked me to check a little, and I asked around, and one man said there was probably some Communist influence. Of course people say that about any outfit they don't like, but he mentioned a name. Dunbar Whipple. He had no evidence, just hearsay. But Whipple might like to know about it. I'd rather not name the man who said it."

No flush or fluster. She even looked a little amused. "I hope," she said, "this isn't a new way of asking me if I'm a Communist."

"It isn't. I'm plain and simple. I would just say, are you?"
"And I would just say no. At first, when people tried to ask me if I was a Communist without really asking it I got indignant, but I soon saw that was silly. I handle it better now. Are you a Birchite, Mr. Goodwin?"
"I refuse to answer. I'm indignant."

==> She laughed a little. "You'll get over it. As for Dunbar Whipple, he's special. He's young and he has a lot to learn, but he'll be the first Negro mayor of New York City." She turned. "I warn you, Miss Rowan, some day I may ask you for a different kind of contribution - to the Whipple for Mayor campaign fund. Would you vote for a Negro?" <==
Lily said it would depend, that she voted for Democrats only, in respect to the memory of her father. I arose to pour coffee, but Miss Brooke looked at her watch and said she had an appointment. Lily gestured toward the terrace and said it was a day to ignore appointments, but Miss Brooke said she couldn't, it was a meeting about a school boycott. She gave Lily a healthy thank-you handshake, but not me, which was proper, since I hadn't said definitely that I wasn't a Birchite. As Lily convoyed her to the foyer I filled my cup and took it to the glass doors to admire the weather.
Lily came to join me. "Quite a gal," she said. "Fighting her way through that to talk school boycott. If she's fascinating, it's lucky for me I'm not."
"It's one of your best points," I said, "that you're not fascinating." I put the cup on a plant stand.
"And that I'm rather selfish. Look me in the eye, Escamillo. Take that back about making you secure and happy and comfortable."
"Not me. I merely said a man." "Name one."

He pushed his chair back, raised his bulk, walked over to the globe, which was

 twice as big around as he was, whirled it, and found Wisconsin.
He turned. "It's closer to Milwaukee. Is there an airplane to Milwaukee?"
"Sure." I stared. "The fare would be around eighty bucks, and then thirty bucks a day. Or more. Whipple might object."
==> "He will have no occasion." He returned to his chair and sat. "Veblen called it instinct of workmanship. Mine was committed when I engaged to serve Mr. Whipple. In your conversation with Miss Rowan and Miss Brooke, which you reported Wednesday evening verbatim, did you note nothing suggestive? Surely not." <==
"You could call it suggestive. After she said she got good and bored in Racine she said, "Then something happened, and - ' And she cut. Okay, suggestive. Maybe the roof in the big house started to leak."
"Pfui. What if Miss Brooke's past were a vital element in an investigation of great moment?"
"I would probably be in Racine now."
"Then you will go. Tomorrow. Confound it, I'm committed."
I shook my head. "Objection. Tomorrow's Sunday and I have a personal commitment."

"I'll talk, son," Whipple told him. To Wolfe: "I know what you mean. I made him eat a little just now, on the way here. I felt I had to tell him what I asked you to do, and he wants to know what you said. You understand that he's - uh - overwrought. As you said, in distress. Of course I would like to know too, what you did. You understand that."
"Yes. I myself have done nothing." Wolfe leaned back, drew in air through his nose, all there was room for, which was plenty, and let it out through his mouth. "Archie. Tell them."
Dunbar blurted at me, "You're Archie Goodwin."
"Right." I moved my eyes to Whipple. "Did you tell him exactly what you asked Mr. Wolfe to do?"
"Yes. Exactly."
==> "Okay. A friend of mine named Lily Rowan invited Miss Brooke to lunch, and I was there. At lunch nothing was discussed but the ROCC. After lunch Miss Rowan gave Miss Brooke a check for a thousand dollars for the ROOC and asked her some questions about herself. Nothing cheeky, just the usual line. Miss Brooke mentioned that she had worked for the Parthenon Press and at the UN, <==

 and I spent three days checking that, mostly at the UN. I found nothing that you could use, and yesterday I took a plane to Chicago and drove to Racine, Wisconsin. At Racine I talked with two men who had known Miss Brooke and her family, a newspaperman and a private detective, and got no hint of anything you could use. You wanted to find out what was wrong with her. Correct?"
"Yes."
"I decided that there was nothing worth mentioning wrong with her and never had been. When I turned in at the hotel last night I intended to leave this morning, and at seven a.m. Mr. Wolfe phoned and told me what had happened, and I left right away and returned to New York. Any questions?"
Dunbar moved. On his feet, peering down at me, his shoulders hunched, he looked like Sugar Ray starting the tenth round, not ending it. "You're lying," he said, not blurting. "You're covering up, I don't know what, but I'm going to. You know who killed her." He wheeled to Wolfe.

Fifty hours went by.
Like you and everyone else, I have various sources of information about what goes on: newspapers, magazines, radio, television, taxicab drivers, random talk here and there, friends, and enemies. I also have two special ones: Lon Cohen, confidential assistant to the publisher of the Gazette, and a woman who is on intimate terms, not familial, with a certain highly distinguished citizen, for whom I once did a big favor. But the news of the arrest of Dunbar Whipple came from none of those sources; it came from Inspector Cramer of Homicide South, whom I couldn't exactly call an enemy and wouldn't presume to call a friend.
During the two days I had not only read the newspapers but had also phoned Lon Cohen a couple of times to ask if there was anything hot about the Susan Brooke murder that wasn't being printed. There wasn't, unless you would call it hot that her brother Kenneth had socked an assistant district attorney on the beak, or that there was nothing to the rumor that it was being hushed up that she had been pregnant. She hadn't been. Of course a lot was being printed: that her handbag, on a table in the apartment, had had more than a hundred dollars in it; that an expensive gold pin had been on her dress and a ring with a big emerald had been on her finger (I had seen the ring); that she had bought a bottle of wine at a package store, and several items at a delicatessen, shortly before eight o'clock; that her mother was prostrated and inaccessible; that everyone at the ROCC had been or was being questioned; and so on. The News came out ahead on shots of Susan Brooke, with one in a bikini on a Puerto Rico beach, but the Gazette had the best one of Dunbar Whipple. Handsome and jaunty.
I wasn't surprised when, at 6:03 Thursday afternoon, Inspector Cramer showed. I

==>  had been expecting him or Sergeant Purley Stebbins, or at least a phone call, since Wednesday noon, when Lily Rowan had phoned to tell me she had had an official caller. Of course they had done a routine check on Susan Brooke's recent activities, of course someone at the ROCC had told them about her lunch with Miss Lily Rowan and Lily's contribution to the cause, of course they had called on Miss Rowan, and of course Lily had told the caller about me, since someone else would - for instance, the hallman - if she didn't. So I had been expecting company, and when the doorbell rang and I saw Cramer's burly figure and round red face and battered old felt hat on the stoop, I went and opened up and said, peeved, "You took your time. We've been expecting you for days." <==
He spoke to me as he entered. Sometimes he doesn't; he just tramps down the hall. The fact that he spoke, and even thanked me for taking his hat and coat, showed that he had come not to claim but to ask. When he entered the office, naturally he didn't offer a hand, since he knows that Wolfe is not a shaker, but before he lowered his fanny onto the red leather chair he uttered a polite greeting and actually made a try at being sociable by asking, "And how are the orchids?"
Wolfe's brows went up. "Passable, thank you. A pot of Miltonia roezli has fourteen scapes."
"Is that so." Cramer sat and pulled his feet in. "Busy? Am I interrupting something?"
"No, sir."
"No case and no client?"

"I haven't said I do."
"Nuts." I tapped the milk carton. "This says it. Getting me here the way you did says it. Why?"
He left the chair and moved. He tiptoed to the door, smooth and silent considering his age and bulk, jerked the door open, and stuck his head out. Evidently he wasn't as sure he was loose as I was that I was. He shut the door and went to the bathroom, and I heard water spurting from a faucet, and in a minute he came with a glass of water. He drank it, in no hurry, put the glass on the table, sat, and narrowed his eyes at me.
"I've been a cop for thirty-six years," he said, "and this is the first time I've ever passed the buck to an outsider."
I had my eyes smile a little. "I'm flattered. Or Mr. Wolfe is."
==> "Balls. He wouldn't know flattery if it had labels pasted all over it, and neither would you. Goodwin, I'm going to tell you something that's for you and Wolfe, and that's "all". No Lou Cohen or Saul Panzer or Lily Rowan. Is that understood?" <==
"I don't know why you drag in Miss Rowan, she's merely a personal friend. And there's no point in telling me something if we can't use it."
"You'll use it all right. But it did "not" come from me. Never, to anybody."
"Okay. Mr. Wolfe isn't here to cinch it by giving you his word of honor, so I'll do it for him. For us. Our word of honor."

"That'll have to do. You won't have to take notes, with your tape-recorder memory. Does the name Morris Althaus mean anything to you?" He spelled it.

"I could, yes. Are you a newspaper reporter? Is this a trick?"
"No. If I were this would be pretty dumb, you'd only have me bounced. I'm Archie Goodwin."
"But I don't..." Long pause. "Very well. The hallman will ask you for identification."
I told her of course, and hung up before she could change her mind.
When leaving the house I had decided that I would completely iguore the tail question, but I couldn't help it if my eyes, while scouting the street for an empty taxi, took notice of standing vehicles. However, when I was in and rolling, up Madison Avenue and then Park, I kept facing front. To hell with the rear.
==> It was a regulation Park Avenue hive in the Eighties - marquee, doorman hopping out when the taxi stopped, rubber runner saving the rug in the lobby - but it was Grade A, because the doorman did not double as hallman. When I showed the hallman, who was expecting me, my private investigator license he gave it a good look, handed it back, and told me 10B, and I went to the elevator. On the tenth floor I was admitted by a uniformed female who took my hat and coat, put them in a closet, and conducted me through an arch into a room even bigger than Lily Rowan's, where twenty couples can dance. I have a test for people with rooms that big - not the rugs or the furniture or the drapes, but the pictures on the walls. If I can tell what they are, okay. If all I can do is guess, look out; these people will bear watching. That room passed the test fine. I was <==

 looking at a canvas showing three girls sitting on the grass under a tree when footsteps came and I turned. She approached. She didn't offer a hand, but she said in a low, soft voice, "Mr. Goodwin? I'm Ivana Althaus," and moved to a chair.
Even without the picture test I would have passed her - her small slender figure with its honest angles, her hair with its honest gray, her eyes with their honest doubt. As I turned a chair to sit facing her I decided to be as honest as possible. She was saying that Miss Hinckley would come soon, but she would prefer not to wait. She had understood me to say on the phone that her son had been killed by an agent of the FBI. Was that correct?
Her eyes were straight at me, and I met them. "Not strictly," I told her. "I said that someone told Mr. Wolfe that. I should explain about Mr. Wolfe. He is - uh - eccentric, and he has certain strong feelings about the New York Police Department. He resents their attitude toward him and his work, and he thinks they interfere too much. He reads the newspapers, and especially news about murders, and a couple of weeks ago he got the idea that the police and the District Attorney were letting go on the murder of your son, and when he learned that your son had been collecting material for an article about the FBI he suspected that the letting go might be deliberate. If so, it might be a chance to give the police a black eye, and nothing would please him better."
Her eyes were staying straight at me, hardly a blink. "So," I said, "we had no case on our hands, and he started some inquiries. One thing we learned, a fact that hasn't been published, was that nothing about the FBI, no notes or documents, was found by the police in your son s apartment. Perhaps you knew that."

*** Bold lover, ever, ever shalt thou kiss,
And win the willing goal, and never leave;
She will not fade, and Thou shalt have they bliss,

Forever wilt thou love, and she be fair ***
==> I haven't read all the poetry in the world, but Lily Rowan has a shelf of it and on certain occasions wants me to read some aloud to her, and I was pretty sure I had read that, but there was something wrong with it. I tried to place it but couldn't. Anyway, the point was, who had written it? Not Althaus; I had seen his hand on various items. Sarah Dacos? If so, I had something. I had plenty. I put it on top of the chest and spent another hour looking, but drew a blank. <==
I had promised Mrs. Althaus I would take nothing without her permission, but I was tempted. I could take the photograph, not out of the house, but just one flight down, knock at Sarah Dacos's door, and if she was there, as she might be on a Saturday, display it and ask her, "Did you write that?" It was a real temptation, so quick and direct. But it was too damned direct. I would have to stick to the roundabout. I left the apartment and the house, found a phone booth, dialed Mrs. Bruner's number and got her, and told her I wanted to come and ask her something. She said she would be there until one o'clock. It was only twenty past twelve. I went out and got a taxi.
She was in her office, at her desk with some papers, expecting me. She asked if Miss Dacos had come as arranged, saying she had rather expected her to phone, but she hadn't. I said yes, she had come, and had been very cooperative. I emphasized the "very," since it was possible that the room was bugged. Then I sat, leaned forward to her, and whispered, "Do you mind if we whisper?"
She frowned. "It is so ridiculous!"
"Yes," I whispered, "but it's safe. You don't need to say much. I only want a sample of Miss Dacos's handwriting. Anything - a memo, a note to you. I know this seems even more ridiculous, but it isn't. Don't ask me to explain because I can't. I'm following instructions. Either you trust Mr. Wolfe to do the job and do it right or you don't."
"But why on earth - " she began, but I showed her a palm.

The immediate question was, should I phone Mrs. Althaus for permission to take the photograph, or should I leave it? I decided that leaving it would be too risky; Sarah might get in somehow and find it and take it. I got a sheet of typewriter paper from the desk and folded it, and inserted the photograph. It was almost too wide for my breast pocket, but I eased it in. I looked around a little, from habit, to be sure things were as I had found them, and left with my loot. As I passed the door of Sarah Dacos's apartment on the way down I threw it a kiss. Then it occurred to me that it rated more than a kiss, and I went and took a look at the lock. It was the same make as the one on Althaus's door, a Bermatt, nothing special.
At the same booth where I had phoned Mrs. Bruner I rang Mrs. Althaus's number, got her, told her I had left everything in order in the apartment, and asked if she wanted the keys returned immediately. She said at my convenience, no hurry.
"By the way," I said, "I'm taking one item, if you don't mind - a photograph of a man that was in a drawer. I want to see if someone recognizes it. All right?"
She said I was very mysterious, but yes, I could take it. I would have liked to tell her what I thought of middle-aged women but decided we weren't intimate enough. I dialed another number, told the woman who answered, whose name

==>  was Mimi, that I would like to speak to Miss Rowan, and in a moment the familiar voice came. <==
"Lunch in ten minutes. Come and get it."
"You're too young for me. I've decided women under fifty are - what are they?" "Well, jejune's a good word."
"Too many Js. I'll think of one and tell you this evening. Two things. One, I have to be home at midnight. I'm sleeping in the office and - I'll explain when I see you."
"Good Lord, has he rented your room?"
"As a matter of fact, he has, for one night. I won't explain that. Hold it a second." I transferred the receiver to my right hand and used the left to slip the photograph from my pocket. "Here's some poetry. Listen." I read it, with feeling. "Do you recognize it?"

It was five minutes to two when I put my hat and coat on the rack in the hall, went to the door of the dining room, told Wolfe, who was at the table, that it looked and felt like snow, and proceeded to the kitchen. I don't join Wolfe when

 I arrive in the middle of a meal; we agree that for one man to hurry with meat or fish while the other dawdles with pastry or cheese is bad for the atmosphere. Fritz put things on my breakfast table and brought what was left of the baked bluefish, and I asked him how he was getting on with the menu for next Thursday's blowout.
"I'm not discussing that," he said. "I am not discussing anything, Archie. He was in my room for more than an hour before lunch, talking with the television on loud. If it is so dangerous I will not talk at all."
I told him we should be back to normal by the time the shad roe started coming, and he threw up his hands and said good God in French.
==> When I finished and went to the office Wolfe was standing over by the globe, turning it and scowling at it. The man who gave him that globe, the biggest one I have ever seen, couldn't have known what a big help it would be. Whenever a situation gets so ticklish that he wishes he were somewhere else, he can walk over to the globe and pick spots to go to. Wonderful. As I entered he asked if I had anything, and when I nodded he went to his desk and I turned on the radio, took a yellow chair around near his elbow, and reported. It didn't take long, since there had been no conversation to speak of, just the action. I didn't mention the phone call to Lily Rowan because it had been purely personal. Having read the poetry twice, he handed the photograph back to me and said she had an ear for meter. <==
"I told you she wasn't a sap," I said. "Pretty neat, doing that with the last four lines of the second stanza of Keats's 'Ode on a Grecian Urn.'"
His eyes narrowed at me. "How the deuce do you know that? You don't read Keats."
I shrugged. "Back in Ohio in my boyhood days. As you know, I have quite a memory. I don't brag about that, but I have a brag coming about this." I tapped the photograph. "We know why she lied. She's involved. Possibly not too deep; it could be that she merely didn't want to admit she was close with him, close enough for him to tell her about the FBI. Or possibly "very" deep. 'Ever, ever shalt thou kiss.' And 'Forever wilt thou love.' But he told her he was going to marry another girl, so she shot him, probably with his own gun. The second alternative, which we prefer by far. It would be hard to nail her. She might be

 able to prove she was at that lecture but not what time she left. Possibly she wasn't there at all. She spent the evening at Sixty-three Arbor Street, having it out with the bold lover, and she shot him before the G-men arrived. Does that appeal to you?"

"Cramer would love to know that. After giving us the steer. I'll call him and tell him, to relieve his mind."
"Pfui. When we have relieved "our" minds by finishing the job we were hired to do we'll consider our obligation to him. If it seems feasible without excessive effort we'll expose the murderer for him. If it isn't a member of the FBI, as he expects and hopes, he won't thank us, but we'll owe him no apology."
"Then we forget the murder until after Thursday."

Yes."
==> "That's just dandy. Agencies are closed today and tomorrow, so Hewitt can't start looking until Monday. I'll be at the Flamingo this evening if anything happens; for instance, if Hewitt calls to say he has decided that it's too much trouble and we have to find someone else. Tomorrow Miss Rowan is having a crowd in for Sunday lunch and dancing and I'll stay afterwards to help empty ashtrays. Any instructions for this afternoon?" <==
"Turn off the radio," he growled.

It bothered me for four days and four nights, from Saturday afternoon, when Wolfe said we would forget the murder, to Wednesday morning, when I did something about it on my own.
There were two aspects. First, if the conjecture about Sarah Dacos, or something like it, was actually a fact, I had removed evidence from the scene of a murder and was withholding it. Of course the cops had had their whack at it, they had certainly seen the photograph and had left it there, and Mrs. Althaus had given me the keys, but that was only a legal out. It was the second aspect that really bothered me. Cramer had saved our licenses for us, at least so far, and it was me, Archie Goodwin, he had invited to a conference and bought a carton of milk for and turned loose on a homicide. I have no objection to playing games with cops, sometimes you want to and sometimes you have to, but this was different. I owed Cramer something personally.
So it bothered me, but something else was bothering me still more, the act Wolfe was staging, the fanciest on record. Too much of it, nearly all of it, was entirely out of our control. For instance, when I called Hewitt from a booth Monday evening to ask how he had made out, and he said fine, he had got one actor at one agency and the other at another, and they would both come to his place Tuesday afternoon, and I asked if he had made sure that the one for me could drive a car and had a license, he said he had forgotten to ask, but everyone could drive a car! And that was absolutely vital and he knew it. He said he would find out right away; he had the actor's phone number. On some other details he was okay, like his phone call to our number Tuesday noon, as arranged. He told Wolfe he was extremely sorry, he apologized, but he would be able to include only twelve "Phalaenopsis Aphrodite" in the shipment instead of twenty, and no
