aka The Affair of the Twisted Scarf
My problems hit a new high that day. What I really felt like doing was to go out for a walk but I wasn’t quite desperate enough for that. So I merely beat it down to the office, shutting the door from the hall behind me, and went and sat at my desk with my feet up, leaned back and closed my eyes, and took a couple of deep breaths.
==> I had made two mistakes. When Bill McNab, garden editor of the Gazette, had suggested to Nero Wolfe that the members of the Manhattan Flower Club be invited to drop in some afternoon to look at the orchids, I should have fought it. <==
And when the date had been set and the invitations sent, and Wolfe had arranged that Fritz and Saul should do the receiving at the front door and I should stay up in the plant-rooms with him and Theodore, mingling with the guests, if I had had an ounce of brains I would have put my foot down. But I hadn’t, and as a result I had been up there a good hour and a half, grinning around and acting pleased and happy... "No, sir, that’s not a brasso, it’s a laelia." ... "Quite all right, madam - your sleeve happened to hook it. It’ll bloom again next year."
It wouldn’t have been so bad if there had been something for the eyes. It was understood that the Manhattan Flower Club was choosy about whom it took in, but obviously its standards were totally different from mine. The men were just men; okay as men go. But the women! It was a darned good thing they had picked on flowers to love, because flowers don’t have to love back.
There had, in fact, been one - just one. I had got a glimpse of her at the other end of the crowded aisle as I went through the door into the cool - room. From ten paces off she looked absolutely promising, and when I had maneuvered close enough to make her an offer to answer questions if she had any, there was simply no doubt about it - no doubt at all.
The first quick, slanting glance she gave me said plainly that she could tell the difference between a flower and a man, but she just smiled and shook her head,

 and moved on with her companions, an older female and two males.

==> All the way down the three flights of stairs new guests were coming up, though it was then four o’clock. Nero Wolfe’s old brownstone house on West 35th Street had seen no such throng as that within my memory, which is long and good. One flight down, I stopped off at my bedroom for a pack of cigarettes; and another flight down, I detoured to make sure the door of Wolfe’s bedroom was locked. <==
In the main hall downstairs I halted a moment to watch Fritz Brenner, busy at the door with both departures and arrivals, and to see Saul Panzer emerge from the front room, which was being used as a cloakroom, with someone’s hat and topcoat. Then, as aforesaid, I entered the office, shutting the door from the hall behind me, went and sat at my desk with my feet up, leaned back and closed my eyes, and took some deep breaths.
I had been there maybe eight or ten minutes, and was getting relaxed and a little less bitter, when the door opened and she came in. Her companions were not along. By the time she had closed the door and turned to me I had got to my feet, with a friendly leer, and had begun, "I was just sitting here thinking -"
The look on her face stopped me. There was nothing wrong with it basically, but something had got it out of kilter. She headed for me, got halfway, jerked to a stop, sank into one of the yellow chairs, and squeaked, "Could I have a drink?"
"Sure thing." I said. I went to the cupboard and got a hooker of old whiskey. Her hand was shaking as she took the glass, but she didn’t spill any, and she got it down in two swallows.
"Did I need that!" "More?"

I nodded. "And you’re the Queen of Egypt?"
"I’m a baboon," she declared. "I don’t know how they ever taught me to talk." She looked around for something to put the glass on, and I moved a step and reached for it. "Look at my hand shake," she complained.
She kept her hand out, looking at it, so I took it in mine and gave it some friendly but gentle pressure. "You do seem a little upset," I conceded.
==> She jerked the hand away. "I want to see Nero Wolfe. I want to see him right away, before I change my mind." She was gazing up at me, with the moist brown eyes. "I’m in a fix now, all right! I’ve made up my mind. I’m going to get Nero Wolfe to get me out of this somehow." <==
I told her it couldn’t be done until the party was over. She looked around. "Are people coming in here?"
I told her no.
"May I have another drink, please?"
I told her she should give the first one time to settle, and instead of arguing she arose and helped herself. I sat down and frowned at her. Her line sounded fairly screwy for a member of the Manhattan Flower Club, or even for a daughter of one. She came back to her chair, sat, and met my eyes. Looking at her straight like that could have been a nice way to pass the time if there had been any chance for a meeting of minds.
"I could tell you," she said.

 didn’t say I’m a cheat." She cleared her throat for the hoarseness. "I said I’m a crook. Remind me some day to tell you the story of my life - how my husband got killed in the war and I broke through the gate. Don’t I sound interesting?"
"You sure do. What’s your line - orchid-stealing?"
"No. I wouldn’t be small and I wouldn’t be dirty - That’s what I used to think, but once you start it’s not so easy. You meet people and you get involved. Two years ago four of us took over a hundred grand from a certain rich woman with a rich husband. I can tell you about that one, even names, because she couldn’t move, anyhow."
I nodded. "Blackmailers’ customers seldom can. What -?" "I’m not a blackmailer!"
==> "Excuse me. Mr. Wolfe often says I jump to conclusions." <==
"You did that time." She was still indignant. "A blackmailer’s not a crook; he’s a snake! Not that it really matters. What’s wrong with being a crook is the other crooks - they make it dirty whether you like it or not. It makes a coward of you, too - that’s the worst. I had a friend once - as close as a crook ever comes to having a friend - and a man killed her, strangled her. If I had told what I knew about it they could have caught him, but I was afraid to go to the cops, so he’s still loose. And she was my friend! That’s getting down toward the bottom. Isn’t it?"
"Fairly low," I agreed, eying her. "Of course, I don’t know you any too well. I don’t know how you react to two stiff drinks. Maybe your hobby is stringing private detectives."
She simply ignored it. "I realized long ago," she went on, as if it were a one-way conversation, "that I had made a mistake. About a year ago I decided to break loose. A good way to do it would have been to talk to someone the way I’m talking to you now, but I didn’t have sense enough to see that."
I nodded. "Yeah, I know."
"So I kept putting it off. We got a good one in December and I went to Florida for a vacation, but down there I met a man with a lead, and we followed it up here just a week ago. That’s what I’m working on now. That’s what brought me

She looked dead serious, not more serious, but a different kind. "I’m not putting anything on him," she declared. "I don’t owe him anything, and I don’t like him. But this is strictly about me and no one else - only, I had to explain why I’m here. I wish to heaven I’d never come!"
There was no question about that coming from her heart, unless she had done a lot of rehearsing in front of a mirror.
"It got you this talk with me," I reminded her.
She was looking straight through me and beyond. "If only I hadn’t come! If only I hadn’t seen him!"
She leaned toward me for emphasis. "I’m either too smart or not smart enough; that’s my trouble. I should have looked away from him, turned away quick, when I realized I knew who he was, before he turned and saw it in my eyes. But I was so shocked I couldn’t help it! I stood there staring at him, thinking I wouldn’t have recognized him if he hadn’t had a hat on, and then he looked at me and saw what was happening. But it was too late.
==> "I know how to manage my face with nearly anybody, anywhere, but that was too much for me. It showed so plain that Mrs. Orwin asked me what was the matter with me, and I had to try to pull myself together. Then, seeing Nero Wolfe gave me the idea of telling him; only of course I couldn’t right there with the crowd. Then I saw you going out, and as soon as I could break away I came down to find you." <==
She tried smiling at me, but it didn’t work so good. "Now I feel somewhat better," she said hopefully.
I nodded. "That’s good whiskey. Is it a secret who you recognized?" "No. I’m going to tell Nero Wolfe."
"You decided to tell me." I flipped a hand. "Suit yourself. Whoever you tell, what’s the good?"

Why - then he can’t do anything to me." "Why not?"

"Because he wouldn’t dare. Nero Wolfe will tell him that I’ve told about him, so that if anything happened to me he would know it was him, and he’d know who he is - I mean, Nero Wolfe would know - and so would you."
"We would if we had his name and address." I was studying her. "He must be quite a specimen, to scare you that bad. And speaking of names, what’s yours?"

She made a little noise that could have been meant for a laugh. "Do you like Marjorie?"
"Not bad. What are you using now?" She hesitated, frowning.
"For Pete’s sake," I protested, "you’re not in a vacuum, and I’m a detective. They took the names down at the door."
"Cynthia Brown," she said.

She glanced at the hall door again, returned to me, and lowered her voice: "This has to be done the way I say."
"Sure; why not?"
"I wasn’t being honest with you."
"I wouldn’t expect it from a crook. Start over."
==> "I mean ..." She used the teeth on the lip again. "I mean I’m not just scared about myself. I’m scared, all right, but I don’t just want Nero Wolfe for what I said. I want him to get him for murder, but he has to keep me out of it. I don’t want to have anything to do with any cops - not now I don’t, especially. If he won’t do it that way - Do you think he will?" <==
I was feeling a faint tingle at the base of my spine. I only get that on special occasions, but this was unquestionably something special. I gave her a hard look and didn’t let the tingle get into my voice: "He might, for you, if you pay him. What kind of evidence have you got? Any?"
"I saw him."
"You mean today?"
"I mean I saw him then." She had her hands clasped tight. "I told you - I had a friend. I stopped in at her apartment that afternoon. I was just leaving - Doris was inside, in the bathroom - and as I got near the entrance door I heard a key turning in the lock, from the outside. I stopped, and the door came open and a man came in. When he saw me he just stood and stared. I had never met Doris’s bank account, and I knew she didn’t want me to. And since he had a key I supposed of course it was him, making an unexpected call; so I mumbled something about Doris’ being in the bathroom and went past him, through the door and on out."
She paused. Her clasped hands loosened and then tightened again.

"Her maid found her body the next morning. The papers said she had been killed the day before. That man killed her. There wasn’t a word about him - no one had seen him enter or leave. And I didn’t open my mouth! I was a rotten coward!"
"And today, all of a sudden, there he is, looking at orchids?" "Yes."
"Are you sure he knows you recognized him?"
"Yes. He looked straight at me, and his eyes -"
She was stopped by the house phone buzzing. Stepping to my desk, I picked it up and asked it, "Well?"
==> Nero Wolfe’s voice, peevish, came: "Archie!" <==
"Yes, sir."
"What the devil are you doing? Come back up here!" "Pretty soon. I’m talking with a prospective client -" "This is no time for clients! Come at once!"
The connection went. He had slammed it down. I hung up and went back to the prospective client: "Mr. Wolfe wants me upstairs. Do you want to wait here?"
"Yes."
"If Mrs. Orwin asks about you?"

"I didn’t feel well and went home."
"Okay. It shouldn’t be long - the invitations said two thirty to five. If you want a drink, help yourself... What name does this murderer use when he goes to look at orchids?"

She looked blank.
I got impatient: "What’s his name? This bird you recognized."
"I don’t know."
"Describe him."
==> She thought it over a little, gazing at me, and then shook her head. "Not now. I want to see what Nero Wolfe says first." <==
She must have seen something in my eyes, or thought she did, for suddenly she came up out of her chair and moved to me and put a hand on my arm. "That’s all I mean," she said earnestly. "It’s not you - I know you’re all right. I might as well tell you - you’d never want any part of me anyhow - this is the first time in years, I don’t know how long, that I’ve talked to a man straight - you know, just human. I - "She stopped for a word, and a little color showed in her cheeks. "I’ve enjoyed it very much."
"Good. Me, too. Call me Archie. I’ve got to go, but describe him."
But she hadn’t enjoyed it that much. "Not until Nero Wolfe says he’ll do it," she said firmly.
I had to leave it at that, knowing as I did that in three more minutes Wolfe might have a fit. Out in the hall I had the notion of passing the word to Saul and Fritz to give departing guests a good look, but rejected it because (a) they weren’t there, both of them presumably being busy in the cloakroom, (b) he might have departed already, and (c) I had by no means swallowed a single word of Cynthia’s story, let alone the whole works.
Up in the plant-rooms there were plenty left. When I came into Wolfe’s range he darted me a glance of cold fury, and I turned on the grin. Anyway, it was a quarter to five, and if they took the hint on the invitation it wouldn’t last much longer.

He shook his head, with a fond but manly smile at her. "It’s not necessary, Mimi. Really."
"She’s all right," I assured them, and pushed off, thinking there were a lot of names in this world that could stand a reshuffle. Calling that overweight, narrow - eyed, pearl-and-mink proprietor Mimi was a paradox.
I moved around among the guests, being gracious. Fully aware that I was not equipped with a Geiger counter that would flash a signal if and when I established contact with a strangler, the fact remained that I had been known to have hunches. It would be something for my scrapbook if I picked the killer of Doris Hatten.
Cynthia Brown hadn’t given me the Hatten, only the Doris, but with the context that was enough. At the time it had happened, some five months ago, early in October, the papers had given it a big play, of course. She had been strangled with her own scarf, of white silk with the Declaration of Independence printed on it, in her cozy firth-floor apartment in the West Seventies, and the scarf had been left around her neck, knotted at the back.
The cops had never got within a mile of charging anyone, and Sergeant Purley Stebbins of Homicide had told me that they had never even found out who was paying the rent.
==> I kept on the go through the plant-rooms, leaving all switches open for a hunch. Some of them were plainly preposterous, but with everyone else I made an opportunity to exchange some words, full face and close up. That took time, and it was no help to my current and chronic campaign for a raise in wages, since it was the women, not the men, that Wolfe wanted off his neck. I stuck at it, anyhow. It was true that if Cynthia was on the level, we would soon have specifications, but I had had that tingle at the bottom of my spine and I was stubborn. <==
As I say, it took time, and meanwhile five o’clock came and went and the crowd thinned out. Going on five-thirty, the remaining groups seemed to get the idea all at once that time was up and made for the entrance to the stairs.
I was in the moderate-room when it happened, and the first thing I knew I was alone there, except for a guy at the north bench studying a row of dowianas. He didn’t interest me, as I had already canvassed him and crossed him off as the wrong type for a strangler; but as I glanced his way he suddenly bent forward to

 pick up a pot with a flowering plant, and as he did so I felt my back stiffening. The stiffening was a reflex, but I knew what had caused it; the way his fingers closed around the pot, especially the thumbs. No matter how careful you are of other people’s property, you don’t pick up a five-inch pot as if you were going to squeeze the life out of it.
I made my way around to him. When I got there he was holding the pot so that the flowers were only a few inches from his eyes.

I made my way around to him. When I got there he was holding the pot so that the flowers were only a few inches from his eyes.
"Nice flower," I said brightly. He nodded.
==> He leaned to put the pot back, still choking it. I swiveled my head. The only people in sight, beyond the glass partition between us and the cool - room, were Nero Wolfe and a small group of guests, among whom were the Orwin trio and Bill McNab, the garden editor of the Gazette. As I turned my head back to my man he straightened up, pivoted on his heel, and marched off without a word. <==
I followed him out to the landing and down the three nights of stairs. Along the main hall I was courteous enough not to step on his heel, but a lengthened stride would have reached it. The hall was next to empty. A woman, ready for the street in a caracul coat, was standing there, and Saul Panzer was posted near the front door with nothing to do.
I followed my man on into the front room, now the cloakroom, where Fritz Brenner was helping a guest on with his coat. Of course, the racks were practically bare, and with one glance my man saw his property and went to get it. I stepped forward to help, but he ignored me without even bothering to shake his head. I was beginning to feel hurt.
When he emerged into the hall I was beside him, and as he moved to the front door I spoke: "Excuse me, but we’re checking guests out as well as in. Your name, please?"
"Ridiculous," he said curtly, and reached for the knob, pulled the door open, and crossed the sill.
Saul, knowing I must have had a reason for wanting to check him out, was at my elbow, and we stood watching his back as he descended the seven steps of the

"Tail?" Saul muttered to me.
I shook my head and was parting my lips to mutter something back, when a sound came from behind us that made us both whirl around - a screech from a woman, not loud but full of feeling. As we whirled, Fritz and the guest he had been serving came out of the front room, and all four of us saw the woman in the caracul coat come running out of the office into the hall. She kept coming, gasping something, and the guest, making a noise like an alarmed male, moved to meet her. I moved faster, needing about eight jumps to the office door and two inside. There I stopped.
Of course, I knew the thing on the floor was Cynthia, but only because I had left her in there in those clothes. With the face blue and contorted, the tongue halfway out and the eyes popping, it could have been almost anybody. I knelt down and slipped my hand inside her dress front, kept it there ten seconds, and felt nothing.
Saul’s voice came from behind: "I’m here."
I got up and went to the phone on my desk and started dialing, telling Saul "No one leaves. We’ll keep what we’ve got. Have the door open for Doc Vollmer." After only two whirs the nurse answered and put Vollmer on, and I snapped it at him: "Doc, Archie Goodwin. Come on the run. Strangled woman... Yeah, strangled."
==> I pushed the phone back, reached for the house phone, and buzzed the plant - rooms, and after a wait had Wolfe’s irritated bark in my ear; "Yes?" <==
"I’m in the office. You’d better come down. That prospective client I mentioned is here on the floor strangled. I think she’s done, but I’ve sent for Vollmer."
"Is this flummery?" he roared.
"No, sir. Come down and look at her and then ask me."
The connection went. He had slammed it down. I got a sheet of thin tissue paper from a drawer, tore off a corner, and placed it carefully over Cynthia’s mouth and nostrils.

Voices had been sounding from the hall. Now one of them entered the office. Its owner was the guest who had been in the cloakroom with Fritz when the screech came. He was a chunky, broad-shouldered guy with sharp, domineering dark eyes and arms like a gorilla’s. His voice was going strong as he started toward me from the door, but it stopped when he had come far enough to get a good look at the object on the floor.
"Oh, no." he said huskily. "Yes, sir," I agreed. "How did it happen?" "Don’t know."
"Who is it?" "Don’t know."
He made his eyes come away from it and up until they met mine, and I gave him an A for control. It really was a sight.
"The man at the door won’t let us leave," he stated. "No, sir. You can see why."
==> "I certainly can." His eyes stayed with me, however. "But we know nothing about it. My name is Carlisle, Homer N. Carlisle. I am the executive vice- president of the North American Foods Company. My wife was merely acting under impulse; she wanted to see the office of Nero Wolfe, and she opened the door and entered. She’s sorry she did, and so am I. We have an appointment, and there’s no reason why we should be detained." <==
"I’m sorry, too," I told him, "but for one thing if for nothing else; your wife discovered the body. We’re stuck worse than you are, with a corpse here in our office. So I guess - Hello, Doc."
Vollmer, entering and nodding at me on the fly, was panting a little as he set his black case on the floor and knelt beside it. His house was down the street and he had had only two hundred yards to trot, but he was taking on weight. As he

 opened the case and got out the stethoscope, Homer Carlisle stood and watched with his lips pressed tight, and I did likewise until I heard the sound of Wolfe’s elevator.
Crossing to the door and into the hall, I surveyed the terrain. Toward the front, Saul and Fritz were calming down the woman in the caracul coat, now Mrs. Carlisle to me. Nero Wolfe and Mrs. Mimi Orwin were emerging from the elevator. Four guests were coming down the stairs: Gene Orwin, Colonel Percy Brown, Bill McNab, and a middle - aged male with a mop of black hair. I stayed by the office door to block the quartet on the stairs.

As Wolfe headed for me, Mrs. Carlisle darted to him and grabbed his arm: "I only wanted to see your office! I want to go! I’m not -"
As she pulled at him and sputtered, I noted a detail: the caracul coat was unfastened, and the ends of a silk scarf, figured and gaily colored, were flying loose. Since at least half of the female guests had sported scarfs, I mention it only to be honest and admit that I had got touchy on that subject.
Wolfe, who had already been too close to too many women that day to suit him, tried to jerk away, but she hung on. She was the big-boned, flat-chested, athletic type, and it could have been quite a tussle, with him weighing twice as much as her and four times as big around, if Saul hadn’t rescued him by coming in between and prying her loose. That didn’t stop her tongue, but Wolfe ignored it and came on toward me: "Has Dr. Vollmer come?"
"Yes, sir."

I realize that you dislike complications and therefore might want me to scratch this out, but at the end she touched a soft spot by saying that she had enjoyed my company, so I prefer to open up to the cops."
"Then do so. Confound it!"
==> I went to the phone and started dialing WAtkins 9 - 8241. Doc Vollmer came out of his corner. Wolfe was pathetic. He moved around behind his desk and lowered himself into his own oversized custom-made number; but there smack in front of him was the object on the floor, so after a moment he made a face, got back onto his feet, grunted like an outraged boar, went across to the other side of the room, to the shelves, and inspected the backbones of books. <==
But even that pitiful diversion got interrupted. As I finished with my phone call and hung up, sudden sounds of commotion came from the hall. Dashing across, getting fingernails on the edge of the door and pulling it open, I saw trouble. A group was gathered in the open doorway of the dining-room, which was across the hall. Saul Panzer went bounding past me toward the front.
At the front door, Col. Percy Brown was stiff-arming Fritz Brenner with one hand and reaching for the doorknob with the other. Fritz, who is chef and housekeeper, is not supposed to double in acrobatics, but he did fine. Dropping to the floor, he grabbed the colonel’s ankles and jerked his feet out from under him.
Then I was there, and Saul, with his gun out; and there, with us, was the guest with the mop of black hair.
"You fool," I told the colonel as he sat up. "If you’d got outdoors Saul would have winged you."
"Guilt," said the black-haired guest emphatically. "The compression got unbearable and he exploded. I’m a psychiatrist."

"Guilt," said the black-haired guest emphatically. "The compression got unbearable and he exploded. I’m a psychiatrist."
"Good for you." I took his elbow and turned him. "Go back in and watch all of

 ‘em. With that wall mirror you can include yourself."
"This is illegal," stated Colonel Brown, who had scrambled to his feet. Saul herded them to the rear.
==> Fritz got hold of my sleeve: "Archie, I’ve got to ask Mr. Wolfe about dinner." <==
"Nuts," I said savagely. "By dinner-time this place will be more crowded than it was this afternoon."
"But he has to eat; you know that."
"Nuts," I said. I patted him on the shoulder. "Excuse my manners, Fritz; I’m upset. I’ve just strangled a young woman."
"Phooey," he said scornfully.
"I might as well have," I declared.

The doorbell rang. It was the first consignment of cops.
==> In my opinion, Inspector Cramer made a mistake. It is true that in a room where a murder has occurred the city scientists may shoot the works. And they do. But, except in rare circumstances, the job shouldn’t take all week, and in the case of our office a couple of hours should have been ample. In fact, it was. By eight o’clock the scientists were through. But Cramer, like a sap, gave the order to seal it up until further notice, in Wolfe’s hearing. He knew that Wolfe spent at least three hundred evenings a year in there, and that was why he did it. <==
It was a mistake. If he hadn’t made it, Wolfe might have called his attention to a certain fact as soon as Wolfe saw it himself, and Cramer would have been saved a lot of trouble.
The two of them got the fact at the same time, from me. We were in the dining- room - this was shortly after the scientists had got busy in the office, and the guests, under guard, had been shunted to the front room - and I was relating my conversation with Cynthia Brown. Whatever else my years as Wolfe’s assistant may have done for me or to me, they have practically turned me into a tape recorder. I gave them the real thing, word for word. When I finished, Cramer had a slew of questions, but Wolfe not a one. Maybe he had already focused on the

 fact above referred to, but neither Cramer nor I had.
Cramer called a recess on the questions to take steps. He called men in and gave orders. Colonel Brown was to be photographed and fingerprinted, and headquarters records were to be checked for him and Cynthia. The file on the murder of Doris Hatten was to be brought to him at once. The lab reports were to be rushed. Saul Panzer and Fritz Brenner were to be brought in.

They came. Fritz stood like a soldier at attention, grim and grave. Saul, only five feet seven, with the sharpest eyes and one of the biggest noses I have ever seen, in his unpressed brown snit and his necktie crooked - he stood like Saul, not slouching and not stiff. Of course, Cramer knew both of them.

"You and Fritz were in the hall all afternoon?" Saul nodded. "The hall and the front room, yes." "Who did you see enter or leave the office?"

"I saw Archie go in about four o’clock - I was just coming out of the front room with someone’s hat and coat. I saw Mrs. Carlisle come out just after she screamed. In between those two I saw no one either enter or leave. We were busy most of the time, either in the hall or the front room."
Cramer grunted. "How about you, Fritz?"
"I saw no one." Fritz spoke louder than usual. "I would like to say something." "Go ahead."
==> "I think a great deal of all this disturbance is unnecessary. My duties here are of the household and not professional, but I cannot help hearing what reaches my ears. Many times Mr. Wolfe has found the answer to problems that were too much for you. This happened here in his own house, and I think it should be left entirely to him." <==
I yooped, "Fritz, I didn’t know you had it in you!"
Cramer was goggling at him. "Wolfe told you to say that, huh?"
"Bah." Wolfe was contemptuous. "It can’t be helped, Fritz. Have we plenty of

 ham and sturgeon?"

Saul’s shoulders went slightly up and down. "There’s more to people than faces. I might go wrong on a few, but not many."
Cramer spoke to a dick standing by the door: "You heard that name, Levy - Malcolm Vedder. Tell Stebbins to check it on that list and send a man to bring him in."
Cramer returned to Saul: "Put it this way: Say I sit you here with that list, and a man or woman is brought in -"
"I could tell you positively whether the person had been here or not, especially if he was wearing the same clothes and hadn’t been disguised. On fitting him to his name I might go wrong in a few cases, but I doubt it."
"I don’t believe you."
==> "Mr. Wolfe does," Saul said complacently. "Archie does. I have developed my faculties." <==
"You sure have. All right; that’s all for now. Stick around."
Saul and Fritz went. Wolfe, in his own chair at the end of the dining table, where ordinarily, at this hour, he sat for a quite different purpose, heaved a deep sigh and closed his eyes. I, seated beside Cramer at the side of the table which put us facing the door to the hall, was beginning to appreciate the problem we were up against.
"Goodwin’s story," Cramer growled. "I mean her story. What do you think?"
Wolfe’s eyes came open a little. "What followed seems to support it. I doubt if she would have arranged for that" - he flipped a hand in the direction of the office across the hall - "just to corroborate a tale. I accept it."
"Yeah. I don’t need to remind you that I know you well and I know Goodwin well. So I wonder how much chance there is that in a day or so you’ll suddenly remember that she had been here before, or one or more of the others had, and you’ve got a client, and there was something leading up to this."

A dick came to relay a phone call from a deputy commissioner. Another dick came in to say that Homer Carlisle was raising the roof in the front room. Meanwhile, Wolfe sat with his eyes shut, but I got an idea of his state of mind from the fact that intermittently his forefinger was making little circles on the polished top of the table.

"Casual is right." Cramer got out a cigar, conveyed it to his mouth, and sank his teeth in it. He never lit one. "Those houses with self-service elevators are worse than walk-ups for a checking job. No one ever sees anyone coming or going. Even so, the man who paid the rent for that apartment was lucky. He may have been clever and careful, but also he was lucky never to have anybody see him enough to give a description of him."
"Possibly Miss Hatten paid the rent herself."
"Sure," Cramer conceded, "she paid it all right, but where did she get it from? No, it was that kind of a set-up. She had only been living there two months, and when we found out how well the man who paid for it had kept himself covered, we decided that maybe he had installed her there just for that purpose. That was why we gave it all we had. Another reason was that the papers started hinting that we knew who he was and that he was such a big shot we were sitting on the lid."

"Something that Mr. Goodwin told us. I want to consider it a little."
"We could consider it together."
"Later. Those people in the front room are my guests. Can’t you dispose of them?"
"One of your guests," Cramer rasped, "was a beaut, all right." He spoke to the dick by the door: "Bring in that woman - what’s her name? Carlisle."

"Oh," Cramer said significantly.
"What do you mean, oh?" Carlisle demanded.
"I mean that I sent for your wife, not you, but you came with her, and that tells me why. You wanted to see to it that she wasn’t indiscreet."
"What’s she got to be indiscreet about?"
"I don’t know. Apparently you do. If she hasn’t, why don’t you sit down and relax?"
==> "I would, sir," Wolfe advised him. "You came in here angry, and you blundered. An angry man is a jackass." <==
It was a struggle for the executive vice-president, but he made it. Cramer went to the wife: "You wanted to say something, Mrs. Carlisle?"
"Only that I’m sorry." Her bony hands, the fingers twined, were on the table before her. "For the trouble I’ve caused."
"I wouldn’t say you caused it exactly - except for yourself and your husband." Cramer was mild. "The woman was dead, whether you went in there or not. But if only as a matter of form, it was essential for me to see you, since you discovered the body. That’s all there is to it as far as I know."
"How could there be anything else?" Carlisle blurted.
Cramer ignored him. "Goodwin, here, saw you standing in the hall not more than two minutes, probably less, prior to the moment you screamed and ran out of the office. How long had you then been downstairs?"

"What time did you arrive?"
"A little after three, I think."
"Were you and your husband together all the time?"
"Of course. Well - you know how it is ... He would want to look longer at something, and I would -"
"Certainly we were," Carlisle said irritably. "You can see why I made that remark about it depending on what she said. She has a habit of being vague."
==> "I’m not actually vague," she protested. "It’s just that everything is relative. Who would have thought my wish to see Nero Wolfe’s office would link me with a crime?" <==
Carlisle exploded. "Hear that? Link!"
"Why did you want to see Wolfe’s office?" Cramer inquired. "Why, to see the globe."
I gawked at her. I had supposed that naturally she would say it was curiosity about the office of a great and famous detective. Apparently, Cramer reacted the same as me.
"The globe?" he demanded.
"Yes, I had read about it, and I wanted to see how it looked. I thought a globe that size, three feet in diameter, would be fantastic in an ordinary room - Oh!"

"No."
"Of course. She wasn’t a member of this flower club. Are you a member?"
"My husband is."
"We both are," Carlisle stated. "Vague again. It’s a joint membership. Isn’t this about enough?"
"Plenty," Cramer conceded. "Thank you, both of you. We won’t bother you again unless we have to... Levy, pass them out."
==> When the door had closed behind them Cramer glared at me and then at Wolfe. "This is sure a sweet one," he said grimly. "Say it’s within the range of possibility that Carlisle is it, and the way it stands right now, why not? So we look into him. We check back on him for six months, and try doing it without getting roars out of him - a man like that in his position. However, it can be done - by three or four men in two or three weeks. Multiply that by what? How many men were here?" <==
"Around a hundred and twenty," I told him. "But you’ll find that at least half of them are disqualified one way or another. As I told you, I took a survey. Say sixty."
"All right, multiply it by sixty. Do you care for it?"
"No," I said.
"Neither do I." Cramer took the cigar from his mouth. "Of course," he said sarcastically, "when she sat in there telling you about him the situation was different. You wanted her to enjoy being with you. You couldn’t reach for the phone and tell us you had a self-confessed crook who could put a quick finger on a murderer and let us come and take over. No!

"Don’t be vulgar," I said severely.
"You had to go upstairs and make a survey! You had to - Well?"
Lieutenant Rowcliff had opened the door and entered. There were some city employees I liked, some I admired, some I had no feeling about, some I could have done without easy - and one whose ears I was going to twist some day. That was Rowcliff. He was tall, strong, handsome, and a pain in the neck.
"We’re all through in there, sir," he said importantly. "We’ve covered everything. Nothing is being taken away, and it is all in order. We were especially careful with the contents of the drawers of Wolfe’s desk, and also we -"
"My desk!" Wolfe roared.

"Yes, your desk," Rowcliff said precisely, smirking.
The blood was rushing into Wolfe’s face.
"She was killed there," Cramer said gruffly. "Did you get anything at all?"
"I don’t think so," Rowcliff admitted. "Of course, the prints have to be sorted, and there’ll be lab reports. How do we leave it?"

"Certainly," Rowcliff sneered.
I said firmly, to Cramer, not to him, "You don’t mean it. We work there. We live there. All our stuff is there."
"Go ahead. Lieutenant," Cramer told Rowcliff, and he wheeled and went.

==> I was full of both feelings and words, but I knew they had to be held in. This was far and away the worst Cramer had ever pulled. It was up to Wolfe. I looked at him. He was white with fury, and his mouth was pressed to so tight a line that there were no lips. <==
"It’s routine," Cramer said aggressively.

Wolfe said icily, "That’s a lie. It is not routine."
"It’s my routine - in a case like this. Your office is not just an office. It’s the place where more fancy tricks have been played than any other spot in New York. When a woman is murdered there, soon after a talk with Goodwin, for which we have no word but his - I say sealing it is routine."
Wolfe’s head came forward an inch, his chin out. "No, Mr. Cramer. I’ll tell you what it is. It is the malefic spite of a sullen little soul and a crabbed and envious mind. It is the childish rancor of a primacy too often challenged and offended. It is the feeble wiggle -"

The door came open to let Mrs. Orwin in.
With Mrs. Carlisle, the husband had come along. With Mrs. Orwin, it was the son. His expression and manner were so different I would hardly have known him. Upstairs his tone had been mean and his face had been mean. Now his narrow little eyes were working overtime to look frank and cordial.
He leaned across the table at Cramer, extending a hand:

"Inspector Cramer? I’ve been hearing about you for years! I’m Eugene Orwin." He glanced at his right. "I’ve already had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Wolfe and Mr. Goodwin - earlier today, before this terrible thing happened. It is terrible."
"Yes," Cramer agreed. "Sit down."

"I will in a moment. I do better with words standing up. I would like to make a statement on behalf of my mother and myself, and I hope you’ll permit it. I’m a member of the bar. My mother is not feeling well. At the request of your men she went in with me to identify the body of Miss Brown, and it was a bad shock, and we’ve been detained now more than two hours."
His mother’s appearance corroborated him. Sitting with her head propped on a hand and her eyes closed, obviously she didn’t care as much about the impression they made on the inspector as her son did.
"A statement would be welcome," Cramer told him, "if it’s relevant."
"I thought so," Gene said approvingly. "So many people have an entirely wrong

He turned a palm up. "That’s what brought me here. My mother came to see the orchids, and she invited Brown and his sister to come, simply because she is goodhearted. But actually she knows nothing about them."
He put his hands on the table and leaned on them, forward at Cramer. "I’m going to be quite frank, Inspector. Under the circumstances, I can’t see that it would serve any useful purpose to let it be published that that woman came here with my mother. I want to make it perfectly clear that we have no desire to evade our

 responsibility as citizens. But how would it help to get my mother’s name in the headlines?"
"Names in headlines aren’t what I’m after," Cramer told him, "but I don’t run the newspapers. If they’ve already got it I can’t stop them. I’d like to say I appreciate your frankness. So you only met Miss Brown a week ago?"
==> Cramer had plenty of questions for both mother and son. It was in the middle of them that Wolfe passed me a slip of paper on which he had scribbled: <==
"Tell Fritz to bring sandwiches and coffee for you and me. Also for those left in the front room. No one else. Of course, Saul and Theodore."
I left the room, found Fritz in the kitchen, delivered the message, and returned.
Gene stayed cooperative to the end, and Mrs. Orwin tried, though it was an effort. They said they had been together all the time, which I happened to know wasn’t so, having seen them separated at least twice during the afternoon, and Cramer did too, since I had told him.
They said a lot of other things, among them that they hadn’t left the plant - rooms between their arrival and their departure with Wolfe; that they had stayed until most of the others were gone because Mrs. Orwin wanted to persuade Wolfe to sell her some plants; that Colonel Brown had wandered off by himself once or twice; that they had been only mildly concerned about Cynthia’s absence, because of assurances from Colonel Brown and me; and so on.
Before they left, Gene made another try for a commitment to keep his mother’s name out of it, and Cramer promised to do his best.

Fritz had brought trays for Wolfe and me, and we were making headway with them. In the silence that followed the departure of the Orwins, Wolfe could plainly be heard chewing a mouthful of mixed salad.
Cramer sat frowning at us. He turned his head: "Levy! Get that Colonel Brown in."
"Yes, sir. That man you wanted - Vedder - he’s here." "Then I’ll take him first."

Up in the plant - rooms Malcolm Vedder had caught my eye by the way he picked up a flowerpot and held it. As he took a chair across the dining table from Cramer and me, I still thought he was worth another good look, but after his answer to Cramer’s third question I relaxed and concentrated on my sandwiches. He was an actor and had had parts in three Broadway plays. Of course, that explained it. No actor would pick up a flowerpot just normally, like you or me. He would have to dramatize it some way, and Vedder had happened to choose a way that looked to me like fingers closing around a throat.

"Othello," Vedder said in a deep, resonant tone. His eyes lifted to Cramer and his

 voice lifted, too: "No, I didn’t know her; I only read about her." He shuddered all over, and then, abruptly, he was out of his chair and on his feet. "I only came here to look at orchids!"
He ran his fingers through his hair, turned, and made for the door.
Levy looked at Cramer with his brows raised, and Cramer shook his head. The next one in was Bill McNab, garden editor of the Gazette.
==> "I can’t tell you how much I regret this, Mr. Wolfe," he said miserably. "Don’t try," Wolfe growled. <==
"What a terrible thing! I wouldn’t have dreamed such a thing could happen - the Manhattan Flower Club! Of course, she wasn’t a member, but that only makes it worse, in a way." McNab turned to Cramer: "I’m responsible for this."
"You are?"
"Yes, it was my idea. I persuaded Mr. Wolfe to arrange it. He let me word the invitations. And I was congratulating myself on the great success! Then this! What can I do?"
"Sit down a minute," Cramer invited him.
McNab varied the monotony on one detail, at least. He admitted that he had left the plant-rooms three times during the afternoon, once to accompany a departing guest down to the ground floor, and twice to go down alone to check on who had come and who hadn’t. Aside from that, he was more of the same. By now it was beginning to seem not only futile, but silly to spend time on seven or eight of them merely because they happened to be the last to go and so were at hand. Also, it was something new to me from a technical standpoint. I had never seen one stack up like that.

Any precinct dick knows that every question you ask of everybody is aimed at one of the three targets: motive, means, and opportunity. In this case there were no questions to ask, because those were already answered. Motive: the guy had followed her downstairs, knowing she had recognized him, had seen her enter Wolfe’s office and thought she was doing exactly what she was doing, getting

 set to tell Wolfe, and had decided to prevent that the quickest and best way he knew. Means: any piece of cloth, even his handkerchief, would do. Opportunity: he was there - all of them on Saul’s list were.

So, if you wanted to learn who strangled Cynthia Brown, first you had to find out who had strangled Doris Hatten.
As soon as Bill McNab had been sent on his way, Col. Percy Brown was brought in. Brown was not exactly at ease, but he had himself well in hand. You would never have picked him for a con man, and neither would I. His mouth and jaw were strong and attractive, and as he sat down he leveled his keen gray eyes at Cramer and kept them there. He wasn’t interested in Wolfe or me. He said his name was Colonel Percy Brown, and Cramer asked him which army he was a colonel in.
"I think," Brown said in a cool, even tone, "it will save time if I state my position: I will answer fully and freely all questions that relate to what I saw, heard, or did since I arrived here this afternoon. Answers to any other questions will have to wait until I consult my attorney."

As soon as Bill McNab had been sent on his way, Col. Percy Brown was brought in. Brown was not exactly at ease, but he had himself well in hand. You would never have picked him for a con man, and neither would I. His mouth and jaw were strong and attractive, and as he sat down he leveled his keen gray eyes at Cramer and kept them there. He wasn’t interested in Wolfe or me. He said his name was Colonel Percy Brown, and Cramer asked him which army he was a colonel in.
"I think," Brown said in a cool, even tone, "it will save time if I state my position: I will answer fully and freely all questions that relate to what I saw, heard, or did since I arrived here this afternoon. Answers to any other questions will have to wait until I consult my attorney."
Cramer nodded. "I expected that. The trouble is I’m pretty sure I don’t give a hoot what you saw or heard this afternoon. We’ll come back to that. I want to put something up to you. As you see, I’m not even wanting to know why you tried to break away before we got here."
"I merely wanted to phone -"

McNab varied the monotony on one detail, at least. He admitted that he had left the plant-rooms three times during the afternoon, once to accompany a departing guest down to the ground floor, and twice to go down alone to check on who had come and who hadn’t. Aside from that, he was more of the same. By now it was beginning to seem not only futile, but silly to spend time on seven or eight of them merely because they happened to be the last to go and so were at hand. Also, it was something new to me from a technical standpoint. I had never seen one stack up like that.
Any precinct dick knows that every question you ask of everybody is aimed at one of the three targets: motive, means, and opportunity. In this case there were no questions to ask, because those were already answered. Motive: the guy had followed her downstairs, knowing she had recognized him, had seen her enter Wolfe’s office and thought she was doing exactly what she was doing, getting

 set to tell Wolfe, and had decided to prevent that the quickest and best way he knew. Means: any piece of cloth, even his handkerchief, would do. Opportunity: he was there - all of them on Saul’s list were.

"Forget it. On information received, I think it’s like this: The woman who called herself Cynthia Brown, murdered here today, was not your sister. You met her in Florida six or eight weeks ago. She went in with you on an operation of which Mrs. Orwin was the subject, and you introduced her to Mrs. Orwin as your sister. You two came to New York with Mrs. Orwin a week ago, with the operation well under way. As far as I’m concerned, that is only background. Otherwise, I’m not interested in it. My work is homicide.
"For me," Cramer went on, "the point is that for quite a period you have been closely connected with this Miss Brown, associating with her in a confidential operation. You must have had many intimate conversations with her. You were having her with you as your sister, and she wasn’t, and she’s been murdered. We could give you a merry time on that score alone.

"I didn’t see it."
Cramer banged his fist on the table so hard the trays danced. "Levy! Take him out and tell Stebbins to send him down and lock him up. Material witness. Put more men on him - he’s got a record somewhere. Find it!"
As the door closed behind them, Cramer turned and said, "Gather up, Murphy. We’re leaving."
Levy came back in and Cramer addressed him: "We’re leaving. Tell Stebbins one man out front will be enough - No, I’ll tell him -"
"There’s one more, sir. His name is Nicholson Morley. He’s a psychiatrist." "Let him go. This is getting to be a joke."
==> Cramer looked at Wolfe. Wolfe looked back at him. <==
"A while ago," Cramer rasped, "you said something had occurred to you." "Did I?" Wolfe inquired coldly.
Their eyes went on clashing until Cramer broke the connection by turning to go. I restrained an impulse to knock their heads together. They were both being childish. If Wolfe really had something, anything at all, he knew Cramer would gladly trade the seals on the office door for it, sight unseen. And Cramer knew he could make the deal himself with nothing to lose. But they were both too sore and stubborn to show any horse sense.
Cramer had circled the end of the table on his way out when Levy reentered to report: "That man Morley insists on seeing you. He says it’s vital."
Cramer halted, glowering. "What is he, a screwball?" "I don’t know, sir. He may be."
"Oh, bring him in."

"Wait a minute," Cramer put in. "Are you suggesting that we deliver everyone that was here today to your office for you to work on?"
"No, not everyone, only the men. When I have finished I may have nothing that can be used as evidence, but there’s an excellent chance that I can tell you who the strangler is -"
"Excuse me," Cramer said. He was on his feet. "Sorry to cut you off, Doctor, but I must get downtown." He was on his way. "I’m afraid your suggestion wouldn’t work - I’ll let you know -"
He went, and Levy and Murphy with him.
Dr. Morley pivoted his head to watch them go, kept it that way a moment, and then he arose and walked out without a word.
==> "Twenty minutes to ten," I announced. Wolfe muttered, "Go look at the office door." <==
"I just did, as I let Morley out. It’s sealed. Malefic spite. But this isn’t a bad room to sit in," I said brightly.

Pfui! I want to ask you something." "Shoot."
"I want your opinion of this. Assume that we accept without reservation the story Miss Brown told you. Assume also that the man she had recognized, knowing she had recognized him, followed her downstairs and saw her enter the office; that he surmised she intended to consult me; that he postponed joining her in the office, either because he knew you were in there with her or for some other reason; that he saw you come out and go upstairs; that he took an opportunity to enter the office unobserved, got her off guard, killed her, got out unobserved, and returned upstairs."
"I’ll take it that way."

"Very well." He turned a hand over. "Is that old typewriter of yours in working order?"
"Fair."
"Bring it down here, and some sheets of blank paper - any kind. I’ll need a blank envelope."
"I have some."
"Bring one. Also the telephone book, Manhattan, from my room."
==> When I returned to the dining-room and was placing the typewriter in position on the table, Wolfe spoke: "No, bring it here. I’ll use it myself." <==
I lifted my brows at him. "A page will take you an hour." "It won’t be a page. Put a sheet of paper in it."
I did so, got the paper squared, lifted the machine, and put it in front of him. He sat and frowned at it for a long minute, and then started pecking. I turned my

 back on him to make it easier to withhold remarks about his two-finger technique, and passed the time by trying to figure his rate. All at once he pulled the paper out.
"I think that will do," he said.

 back on him to make it easier to withhold remarks about his two-finger technique, and passed the time by trying to figure his rate. All at once he pulled the paper out.
"I think that will do," he said.
I took it and read what he had typed:
"She told me enough this afternoon so that I know who to send this to, and more. I have kept it to myself because I haven’t decided what is the right thing to do. I would like to have a talk with you first, and if you will phone me tomorrow, Tuesday, between nine o’clock and noon, we can make an appointment; please don’t put it off or I will have to decide myself."
==> I read it over three times. I looked at Wolfe. He had put an envelope in the typewriter and was consulting the phone book. He began pecking, addressing the envelope. I waited until he had finished and rolled the envelope out. <==
"Just like this?" I asked. "No name or initials signed?" "No."
"I admit it’s nifty," I admitted. "We could forget the calculation and send this to every guy on that list and wait to see who phoned."
"I prefer to send it only to one person - the one indicated by your report of that conversation. That will test the calculation."
"And save postage." I glanced at the paper. "The extreme danger, I suppose, is that I’ll get strangled."
"I don’t want to minimize the risk of this, Archie."

"Right. The envelope, please."


He handed it to me.
That Tuesday morning I was kept busy from eight o’clock on by the phone and the doorbell. After nine, Saul was there to help, but not with the phone, because the orders were that I was to answer all calls. They were mostly from newspapers, but there were a couple from Homicide and a few scattered ones. I took them on the extension in the kitchen.
==> Every time I lifted the thing and told the transmitter, "Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie Goodwin speaking," my pulse went up a notch, and then had to level off again. I had one argument, with a bozo in the District Attorney’s office who had the strange idea that he could order me to report for an interview at eleven-thirty sharp, which ended by my agreeing to call later to fix an hour. <==
A little before eleven I was in the kitchen with Saul, who, at Wolfe’s direction, had been briefed to date, when the phone rang.
"Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie Goodwin speaking." "Mr. Goodwin?"
"Right."
"You sent me a note."
My hand wanted to grip the phone the way Vedder had gripped the flowerpot, but I wouldn’t let it.

"I can wiggle free." "With a car to drive?" "Yeah, I have a car."
"Drive to a lunchroom at the north-east corner of Fifty-first Street and Eleventh Avenue. Get there at eight o’clock. Park your car on Fifty-first Street, but not at the corner. You will be alone, of course. Go in the lunchroom and order something to eat. I won’t be there, but you will get a message. You’ll be there at eight?"
"Yes. I still don’t recognize your voice. I don’t think you’re the person I sent the note to."
"I am. It’s good, isn’t it?"
The connection went. I hung up, told Fritz he could answer calls now, and hotfooted it to the stairs and up three flights.
==> Wolfe was, in the cool-room. When I told him about the call he merely nodded. <==
"That call," he said, "validates our assumptions and verifies our calculation, but that’s all. Has anyone come to take those seals off?"
I told him no. "I asked Stebbins about it and he said he’d ask Cramer." "Don’t ask again," he snapped. "We’ll go down to my room."
If the strangler had been in Wolfe’s house the rest of that day he would have felt honored - or anyway he should. Even during Wolfe’s afternoon hours in the plant rooms, from four to six, his mind was on my appointment, as was proved by the crop of new slants and ideas that poured out of him when he came down to the kitchen. Except for a trip to Leonard Street to answer an hour’s worth of questions by an assistant district attorney, my day was devoted to it, too. My most useful errand - though at the time it struck me as a waste of time and money - was one made to Doc Vollmer for a prescription and then to a drugstore, under instructions from Wolfe.

When I got back from the D.A.’s office Saul and I got in the sedan and went for a reconnaissance. We didn’t stop at 51st Street and 11th Avenue but drove past it four times. The main idea was to find a place for Saul. He and Wolfe both insisted that he had to be there.
We finally settled for a filling station across the street from the lunchroom. Saul was to have a taxi drive in there at eight o’clock, and stay in the passenger’s seat while the driver tried to get his carburetor adjusted. There were so many contingencies to be agreed on that if it had been anyone but Saul I wouldn’t have expected him to remember more than half. For instance, in case I left the lunchroom and got in my car and drove off, Saul was not to follow unless I cranked my window down.
Trying to provide for contingencies was okay, in a way, but actually it was strictly up to me, since I had to let the other guy make the rules. And with the other guy making the rules no one gets very far, not even Nero Wolfe arranging for contingencies ahead of time.

"I don’t." I was putting the raincoat on. "If I get frisked, a sock is as easy to feel as a pocket."

It wasn’t actually raining, merely trying to make up its mind, but after a couple of blocks I reached to switch on the windshield wiper. As I turned uptown on 10th Avenue the dash clock said 7:47; as I turned left on 51st Street it had only got to 7:51. At that time of day in that district there was plenty of space, and I rolled to the curb and stopped about twenty yards short of the corner, stopped the engine and turned the window down for a good view of the filling station across the street. There was no taxi there. At 7:59 a taxi pulled in and stopped by the

"I talked to her. I talked a little first." His head gave a quick jerk, as if a fly were bothering him and his hands were too occupied to attend to it. "What did she tell you?"
"About that day at Doris Hatten’s apartment - you coming in and her going out. And of course her recognizing you there yesterday."
"She is dead. There is no evidence. You can’t prove anything."
I grinned. "Then you’re wasting a lot of time and energy and the best disguise I ever saw. Why didn’t you just toss my note in the wastebasket? ... Let me answer. You didn’t dare. In getting evidence, knowing exactly what and who to look for makes all the difference. You knew I knew."
"And you haven’t told the police?" "No."

"No."
"Why not?"
I shrugged. "I may not put it very well," I said, "because this is the first time I have ever talked with my hands and feet tied, and I find it cramps my style. But it strikes me as the kind of coincidence that doesn’t happen very often. I’m fed

 up with the detective business, and I’d like to quit. I have something that’s worth a good deal to you - say, fifty thousand dollars. It can be arranged so that you get what you pay for. I’ll go the limit on that, but it has to be closed quick. If you don’t buy, I’m going to have a tough time explaining why I didn’t remember sooner what she told me. Twenty-four hours from now is the absolute limit."

There was a sudden noise in his throat as if he had started to choke. He stood up. "You’re working your hand loose," he said huskily, and moved toward me.
It might have been guessed from his voice, thick and husky from the blood rushing to his head, but it was plain as day in his eyes, suddenly fixed and glassy, like a blind man’s eyes. Evidently he had come there fully intending to kill me, and had now worked himself up to it.
"Hold it!" I snapped at him.
He halted, muttering, "You’re getting your hand loose," and moved again, passing me to get behind.
I jerked my body and the chair violently aside and around, and had him in front of me again.
==> "No good," I told him. "They only went down one flight. I heard ‘em. It’s no good, anyway. I’ve got another note for you - from Nero Wolfe - here in my breast pocket. Help yourself, but stay in front of me." <==
He was only two steps from me, but it took him four small, slow ones. His gloved hand went inside my coat to the breast pocket, and came out with a folded slip of yellow paper. From the way his eyes looked, I doubted if he would be able to read, but apparently he was. I watched his face as he took it in, in Wolfe’s precise handwriting:
"If Mr. Goodwin is not home by midnight the information given him by Cynthia Brown will be communicated to the police, and I shall see that they act

 immediately. NERO WOLFE."
He looked at me, and slowly his eyes changed. No longer glassy, they began to let light in. Before, he had just been going to kill me. Now, he hated me.

I got voluble: "So it’s no good, see? He did it this way because if you had known I had told him, you would have sat tight. He figured that you would think you could handle me, and I admit you tried your best. He wants fifty thousand dollars by tomorrow at six o’clock, no later. You say it can’t be arranged so you’ll get what you pay for, but we say it can and it’s up to you. You say we have no evidence, but we can get it - don’t think we can’t. As for me, I wouldn’t advise you even to pull my hair. It would make him sore at you, and he’s not sore now, he just wants fifty thousand bucks."

He had started to tremble, and knew it, and was trying to stop.
"Maybe," I conceded, "you can’t get that much that quick. In that case he’ll take your I.O.U. - you can write it on the back of that note he sent you. My pen’s here in my vest pocket. He’ll be reasonable."
"I’m not such a fool," he said harshly.
"Who said you were?" I was sharp and urgent, and thought I had loosened him. "Use your head, that’s all. We’ve either got you cornered or we haven’t. If we haven’t, what are you doing here? If we have, a little thing like your name signed to an I.O.U won’t make it any worse. He won’t press you too hard. Here, get my pen, right here."
I still think I had loosened him. It was in his eyes and the way he stood, sagging a little. If my hands had been free, so I could have got the pen myself, and uncapped it and put it between his fingers, I would have had him. I had him to the point of writing and signing, but not to the point of taking my pen out of my pocket. But, of course, if my hands had been free I wouldn’t have been bothering about an I.O.U and a pen.
==> So he slipped from under. He shook his head, and his shoulders stiffened. The hate that filled his eyes was in his voice, too: "You said twenty-four hours. That gives me tomorrow. I’ll have to decide. Tell Nero Wolfe I’ll decide." <==
He crossed to the door and pulled it open. He went out, closing the door, and I

 heard his steps descending the stairs; but he hadn’t taken his hat and coat, and I nearly cracked my temples trying to use my brain. I hadn’t got far when there were steps on the stairs again, coming up, and in they came, all three of them.
My host spoke to Skinny: "What time does your watch say?" Skinny glanced at his wrist. "Nine thirty-two."
"At half-past ten untie his left hand. Leave him like that and go. It will take him five minutes or more to get his other hand and his feet free. Have you any objection to that?"

W-J reached for her. But, as he did so, all of a sudden she was neither man nor woman, but a cyclone. Her first leap, away from his reaching hand, was sidewise, and by the time he had realized he didn’t have her she had got to the table and grabbed the gun. He made for her, and she pulled the trigger, and down he went, tumbling right at her feet. By that time Skinny was almost to her, and she whirled and blazed away again. He kept going, and from the force of the blow on my left shoulder I might have calculated, if I had been in a mood for calculating, that the bullet had not gone through Skinny before it hit me. She pulled the trigger a third time, but by then Skinny had her wrist and was breaking her arm.
"She got me!" W - J was yelling indignantly. "She got me in the leg!"
Skinny had her down on her knees. "Come and cut me loose," I called to him, "and go find a phone."
Except for my wrists and ankles and shoulder and head, I felt fine.
"I hope you’re satisfied," Inspector Cramer said sourly. "You and Goodwin have got your pictures in the paper again. You got no fee, but a lot of free publicity. I got my nose wiped."
==> Wolfe grunted comfortably. <==
The whole squad had been busy with chores: visiting W-J at the hospital; conversing with Mr and Mrs. Carlisle at the D.A.’s office; starting to round up circumstantial evidence to show that Mr. Carlisle had furnished the necessary for Doris Hatten’s rent and Mrs. Carlisle knew it; pestering Skinny; and other items. I had been glad to testify that Skinny, whose name was Herbert Marvel, was one-hundred-proof.

"What I chiefly came for," Cramer went on, "was to let you know that I realize there’s nothing I can do. I know Cynthia Brown described her to Goodwin, and probably gave him her name, too, and Goodwin told you. And you wanted to hog it. I suppose you thought you could pry a fee out of somebody. Both of you suppressed evidence." He gestured. "Okay, I can’t prove it. But I know it, and I want you to know I know it. And I’m not going to forget it."
"The trouble is," Wolfe murmured, "that if you can’t prove you’re right, and of course you can’t, neither can I prove you’re wrong."
"Oh, yes, you can. But you haven’t!" "I would gladly try. How?"

Cramer leaned forward. "Like this: If she hadn’t been described to Goodwin, how did you pick her for him to send that blackmail note to?"
Wolfe shrugged. "It was a calculation, as I told you. I concluded that the murderer was among those who remained until the body had been discovered. It was worth testing. If there had been no phone call in response to Mr. Goodwin’s note, the calculation would have been discredited and I would -"
"Yeah, but why her?"
"There were only two women who remained. Obviously, it couldn’t have been Mrs. Orwin; with her physique she would be hard put to pass as a man. Besides, she is a widow, and it was a sound presumption that Doris Hatten had been killed by a jealous wife, who -"

"Oh, that." Wolfe picked up a glass of beer and drained it with more deliberation than usual. He was having a swell time.

aka The Affair of the Twisted Scarf
My problems hit a new high that day. What I really felt like doing was to go out for a walk but I wasn’t quite desperate enough for that. So I merely beat it down to the office, shutting the door from the hall behind me, and went and sat at my desk with my feet up, leaned back and closed my eyes, and took a couple of deep breaths.
==> I had made two mistakes. When Bill McNab, garden editor of the Gazette, had suggested to Nero Wolfe that the members of the Manhattan Flower Club be invited to drop in some afternoon to look at the orchids, I should have fought it. <==
And when the date had been set and the invitations sent, and Wolfe had arranged that Fritz and Saul should do the receiving at the front door and I should stay up in the plant-rooms with him and Theodore, mingling with the guests, if I had had an ounce of brains I would have put my foot down. But I hadn’t, and as a result I had been up there a good hour and a half, grinning around and acting pleased and happy... "No, sir, that’s not a brasso, it’s a laelia." ... "Quite all right, madam - your sleeve happened to hook it. It’ll bloom again next year."
It wouldn’t have been so bad if there had been something for the eyes. It was understood that the Manhattan Flower Club was choosy about whom it took in, but obviously its standards were totally different from mine. The men were just men; okay as men go. But the women! It was a darned good thing they had picked on flowers to love, because flowers don’t have to love back.
There had, in fact, been one - just one. I had got a glimpse of her at the other end of the crowded aisle as I went through the door into the cool - room. From ten paces off she looked absolutely promising, and when I had maneuvered close enough to make her an offer to answer questions if she had any, there was simply no doubt about it - no doubt at all.
The first quick, slanting glance she gave me said plainly that she could tell the difference between a flower and a man, but she just smiled and shook her head,

 and moved on with her companions, an older female and two males. Later, I had made another try and got another brush-off, and still later, too long later, feeling that the grin might freeze on me for good if I didn’t take a recess, I went AWOL by worming my way to the far end of the warm-room and sidling on out.
==> All the way down the three flights of stairs new guests were coming up, though it was then four o’clock. Nero Wolfe’s old brownstone house on West 35th Street had seen no such throng as that within my memory, which is long and good. One flight down, I stopped off at my bedroom for a pack of cigarettes; and another flight down, I detoured to make sure the door of Wolfe’s bedroom was locked. <==
In the main hall downstairs I halted a moment to watch Fritz Brenner, busy at the door with both departures and arrivals, and to see Saul Panzer emerge from the front room, which was being used as a cloakroom, with someone’s hat and topcoat. Then, as aforesaid, I entered the office, shutting the door from the hall behind me, went and sat at my desk with my feet up, leaned back and closed my eyes, and took some deep breaths.
I had been there maybe eight or ten minutes, and was getting relaxed and a little less bitter, when the door opened and she came in. Her companions were not along. By the time she had closed the door and turned to me I had got to my feet, with a friendly leer, and had begun, "I was just sitting here thinking -"
The look on her face stopped me. There was nothing wrong with it basically, but something had got it out of kilter. She headed for me, got halfway, jerked to a stop, sank into one of the yellow chairs, and squeaked, "Could I have a drink?"
"Sure thing." I said. I went to the cupboard and got a hooker of old whiskey. Her hand was shaking as she took the glass, but she didn’t spill any, and she got it down in two swallows.
"Did I need that!" "More?"

I nodded. "And you’re the Queen of Egypt?"
"I’m a baboon," she declared. "I don’t know how they ever taught me to talk." She looked around for something to put the glass on, and I moved a step and reached for it. "Look at my hand shake," she complained.
She kept her hand out, looking at it, so I took it in mine and gave it some friendly but gentle pressure. "You do seem a little upset," I conceded.
==> She jerked the hand away. "I want to see Nero Wolfe. I want to see him right away, before I change my mind." She was gazing up at me, with the moist brown eyes. "I’m in a fix now, all right! I’ve made up my mind. I’m going to get Nero Wolfe to get me out of this somehow." <==
I told her it couldn’t be done until the party was over. She looked around. "Are people coming in here?"
I told her no.
"May I have another drink, please?"
I told her she should give the first one time to settle, and instead of arguing she arose and helped herself. I sat down and frowned at her. Her line sounded fairly screwy for a member of the Manhattan Flower Club, or even for a daughter of one. She came back to her chair, sat, and met my eyes. Looking at her straight like that could have been a nice way to pass the time if there had been any chance for a meeting of minds.
"I could tell you," she said.

She looked dead serious, not more serious, but a different kind. "I’m not putting anything on him," she declared. "I don’t owe him anything, and I don’t like him. But this is strictly about me and no one else - only, I had to explain why I’m here. I wish to heaven I’d never come!"
There was no question about that coming from her heart, unless she had done a lot of rehearsing in front of a mirror.
"It got you this talk with me," I reminded her.
She was looking straight through me and beyond. "If only I hadn’t come! If only I hadn’t seen him!"
She leaned toward me for emphasis. "I’m either too smart or not smart enough; that’s my trouble. I should have looked away from him, turned away quick, when I realized I knew who he was, before he turned and saw it in my eyes. But I was so shocked I couldn’t help it! I stood there staring at him, thinking I wouldn’t have recognized him if he hadn’t had a hat on, and then he looked at me and saw what was happening. But it was too late.
==> "I know how to manage my face with nearly anybody, anywhere, but that was too much for me. It showed so plain that Mrs. Orwin asked me what was the matter with me, and I had to try to pull myself together. Then, seeing Nero Wolfe gave me the idea of telling him; only of course I couldn’t right there with the crowd. Then I saw you going out, and as soon as I could break away I came down to find you." <==
She tried smiling at me, but it didn’t work so good. "Now I feel somewhat better," she said hopefully.
I nodded. "That’s good whiskey. Is it a secret who you recognized?" "No. I’m going to tell Nero Wolfe."
"You decided to tell me." I flipped a hand. "Suit yourself. Whoever you tell, what’s the good?"

Why - then he can’t do anything to me." "Why not?"

"Because he wouldn’t dare. Nero Wolfe will tell him that I’ve told about him, so that if anything happened to me he would know it was him, and he’d know who he is - I mean, Nero Wolfe would know - and so would you."
"We would if we had his name and address." I was studying her. "He must be quite a specimen, to scare you that bad. And speaking of names, what’s yours?"

She made a little noise that could have been meant for a laugh. "Do you like Marjorie?"
"Not bad. What are you using now?" She hesitated, frowning.
"For Pete’s sake," I protested, "you’re not in a vacuum, and I’m a detective. They took the names down at the door."
"Cynthia Brown," she said.

She glanced at the hall door again, returned to me, and lowered her voice: "This has to be done the way I say."
"Sure; why not?"
"I wasn’t being honest with you."
"I wouldn’t expect it from a crook. Start over."
==> "I mean ..." She used the teeth on the lip again. "I mean I’m not just scared about myself. I’m scared, all right, but I don’t just want Nero Wolfe for what I said. I want him to get him for murder, but he has to keep me out of it. I don’t want to have anything to do with any cops - not now I don’t, especially. If he won’t do it that way - Do you think he will?" <==
I was feeling a faint tingle at the base of my spine. I only get that on special occasions, but this was unquestionably something special. I gave her a hard look and didn’t let the tingle get into my voice: "He might, for you, if you pay him. What kind of evidence have you got? Any?"
"I saw him."
"You mean today?"
"I mean I saw him then." She had her hands clasped tight. "I told you - I had a friend. I stopped in at her apartment that afternoon. I was just leaving - Doris was inside, in the bathroom - and as I got near the entrance door I heard a key turning in the lock, from the outside. I stopped, and the door came open and a man came in. When he saw me he just stood and stared. I had never met Doris’s bank account, and I knew she didn’t want me to. And since he had a key I supposed of course it was him, making an unexpected call; so I mumbled something about Doris’ being in the bathroom and went past him, through the door and on out."
She paused. Her clasped hands loosened and then tightened again.

"Her maid found her body the next morning. The papers said she had been killed the day before. That man killed her. There wasn’t a word about him - no one had seen him enter or leave. And I didn’t open my mouth! I was a rotten coward!"
"And today, all of a sudden, there he is, looking at orchids?" "Yes."
"Are you sure he knows you recognized him?"
"Yes. He looked straight at me, and his eyes -"
She was stopped by the house phone buzzing. Stepping to my desk, I picked it up and asked it, "Well?"
==> Nero Wolfe’s voice, peevish, came: "Archie!" <==
"Yes, sir."
"What the devil are you doing? Come back up here!" "Pretty soon. I’m talking with a prospective client -" "This is no time for clients! Come at once!"
The connection went. He had slammed it down. I hung up and went back to the prospective client: "Mr. Wolfe wants me upstairs. Do you want to wait here?"
"Yes."
"If Mrs. Orwin asks about you?"

She looked blank.
I got impatient: "What’s his name? This bird you recognized."
"I don’t know."
"Describe him."
==> She thought it over a little, gazing at me, and then shook her head. "Not now. I want to see what Nero Wolfe says first." <==
She must have seen something in my eyes, or thought she did, for suddenly she came up out of her chair and moved to me and put a hand on my arm. "That’s all I mean," she said earnestly. "It’s not you - I know you’re all right. I might as well tell you - you’d never want any part of me anyhow - this is the first time in years, I don’t know how long, that I’ve talked to a man straight - you know, just human. I - "She stopped for a word, and a little color showed in her cheeks. "I’ve enjoyed it very much."
"Good. Me, too. Call me Archie. I’ve got to go, but describe him."
But she hadn’t enjoyed it that much. "Not until Nero Wolfe says he’ll do it," she said firmly.
I had to leave it at that, knowing as I did that in three more minutes Wolfe might have a fit. Out in the hall I had the notion of passing the word to Saul and Fritz to give departing guests a good look, but rejected it because (a) they weren’t there, both of them presumably being busy in the cloakroom, (b) he might have departed already, and (c) I had by no means swallowed a single word of Cynthia’s story, let alone the whole works.
Up in the plant-rooms there were plenty left. When I came into Wolfe’s range he darted me a glance of cold fury, and I turned on the grin. Anyway, it was a quarter to five, and if they took the hint on the invitation it wouldn’t last much longer.

They didn’t take the hint on the dot, but it didn’t bother me because my mind was occupied. I was now really interested in them - or at least one of them, if he had actually been there and hadn’t gone home.
First, there was a chore to get done. I found the three Cynthia had been with, a

I was in the moderate-room when it happened, and the first thing I knew I was alone there, except for a guy at the north bench studying a row of dowianas. He didn’t interest me, as I had already canvassed him and crossed him off as the wrong type for a strangler; but as I glanced his way he suddenly bent forward to

 pick up a pot with a flowering plant, and as he did so I felt my back stiffening. The stiffening was a reflex, but I knew what had caused it; the way his fingers closed around the pot, especially the thumbs. No matter how careful you are of other people’s property, you don’t pick up a five-inch pot as if you were going to squeeze the life out of it.
I made my way around to him. When I got there he was holding the pot so that the flowers were only a few inches from his eyes.
"Nice flower," I said brightly. He nodded.
==> He leaned to put the pot back, still choking it. I swiveled my head. The only people in sight, beyond the glass partition between us and the cool - room, were Nero Wolfe and a small group of guests, among whom were the Orwin trio and Bill McNab, the garden editor of the Gazette. As I turned my head back to my man he straightened up, pivoted on his heel, and marched off without a word. <==
I followed him out to the landing and down the three nights of stairs. Along the main hall I was courteous enough not to step on his heel, but a lengthened stride would have reached it. The hall was next to empty. A woman, ready for the street in a caracul coat, was standing there, and Saul Panzer was posted near the front door with nothing to do.
I followed my man on into the front room, now the cloakroom, where Fritz Brenner was helping a guest on with his coat. Of course, the racks were practically bare, and with one glance my man saw his property and went to get it. I stepped forward to help, but he ignored me without even bothering to shake his head. I was beginning to feel hurt.
When he emerged into the hall I was beside him, and as he moved to the front door I spoke: "Excuse me, but we’re checking guests out as well as in. Your name, please?"
"Ridiculous," he said curtly, and reached for the knob, pulled the door open, and crossed the sill.
Saul, knowing I must have had a reason for wanting to check him out, was at my elbow, and we stood watching his back as he descended the seven steps of the

Voices had been sounding from the hall. Now one of them entered the office. Its owner was the guest who had been in the cloakroom with Fritz when the screech came. He was a chunky, broad-shouldered guy with sharp, domineering dark eyes and arms like a gorilla’s. His voice was going strong as he started toward me from the door, but it stopped when he had come far enough to get a good look at the object on the floor.
"Oh, no." he said huskily. "Yes, sir," I agreed. "How did it happen?" "Don’t know."
"Who is it?" "Don’t know."
He made his eyes come away from it and up until they met mine, and I gave him an A for control. It really was a sight.
"The man at the door won’t let us leave," he stated. "No, sir. You can see why."
==> "I certainly can." His eyes stayed with me, however. "But we know nothing about it. My name is Carlisle, Homer N. Carlisle. I am the executive vice- president of the North American Foods Company. My wife was merely acting under impulse; she wanted to see the office of Nero Wolfe, and she opened the door and entered. She’s sorry she did, and so am I. We have an appointment, and there’s no reason why we should be detained." <==
"I’m sorry, too," I told him, "but for one thing if for nothing else; your wife discovered the body. We’re stuck worse than you are, with a corpse here in our office. So I guess - Hello, Doc."
Vollmer, entering and nodding at me on the fly, was panting a little as he set his black case on the floor and knelt beside it. His house was down the street and he had had only two hundred yards to trot, but he was taking on weight. As he

 opened the case and got out the stethoscope, Homer Carlisle stood and watched with his lips pressed tight, and I did likewise until I heard the sound of Wolfe’s elevator.
Crossing to the door and into the hall, I surveyed the terrain. Toward the front, Saul and Fritz were calming down the woman in the caracul coat, now Mrs. Carlisle to me. Nero Wolfe and Mrs. Mimi Orwin were emerging from the elevator. Four guests were coming down the stairs: Gene Orwin, Colonel Percy Brown, Bill McNab, and a middle - aged male with a mop of black hair. I stayed by the office door to block the quartet on the stairs.

As Wolfe headed for me, Mrs. Carlisle darted to him and grabbed his arm: "I only wanted to see your office! I want to go! I’m not -"
As she pulled at him and sputtered, I noted a detail: the caracul coat was unfastened, and the ends of a silk scarf, figured and gaily colored, were flying loose. Since at least half of the female guests had sported scarfs, I mention it only to be honest and admit that I had got touchy on that subject.
Wolfe, who had already been too close to too many women that day to suit him, tried to jerk away, but she hung on. She was the big-boned, flat-chested, athletic type, and it could have been quite a tussle, with him weighing twice as much as her and four times as big around, if Saul hadn’t rescued him by coming in between and prying her loose. That didn’t stop her tongue, but Wolfe ignored it and came on toward me: "Has Dr. Vollmer come?"
"Yes, sir."
The executive vice - president emerged from the office, talking: "Mr. Wolfe, my name is Homer N. Carlisle and I insist -"

"What time did you arrive?"
"A little after three, I think."
"Were you and your husband together all the time?"
"Of course. Well - you know how it is ... He would want to look longer at something, and I would -"
"Certainly we were," Carlisle said irritably. "You can see why I made that remark about it depending on what she said. She has a habit of being vague."
==> "I’m not actually vague," she protested. "It’s just that everything is relative. Who would have thought my wish to see Nero Wolfe’s office would link me with a crime?" <==
Carlisle exploded. "Hear that? Link!"
"Why did you want to see Wolfe’s office?" Cramer inquired. "Why, to see the globe."
I gawked at her. I had supposed that naturally she would say it was curiosity about the office of a great and famous detective. Apparently, Cramer reacted the same as me.
"The globe?" he demanded.
"Yes, I had read about it, and I wanted to see how it looked. I thought a globe that size, three feet in diameter, would be fantastic in an ordinary room - Oh!"

"Right. The envelope, please."


He handed it to me.
That Tuesday morning I was kept busy from eight o’clock on by the phone and the doorbell. After nine, Saul was there to help, but not with the phone, because the orders were that I was to answer all calls. They were mostly from newspapers, but there were a couple from Homicide and a few scattered ones. I took them on the extension in the kitchen.
==> Every time I lifted the thing and told the transmitter, "Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie Goodwin speaking," my pulse went up a notch, and then had to level off again. I had one argument, with a bozo in the District Attorney’s office who had the strange idea that he could order me to report for an interview at eleven-thirty sharp, which ended by my agreeing to call later to fix an hour. <==
A little before eleven I was in the kitchen with Saul, who, at Wolfe’s direction, had been briefed to date, when the phone rang.
"Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie Goodwin speaking." "Mr. Goodwin?"
"Right."
"You sent me a note."
My hand wanted to grip the phone the way Vedder had gripped the flowerpot, but I wouldn’t let it.

If the strangler had been in Wolfe’s house the rest of that day he would have felt honored - or anyway he should. Even during Wolfe’s afternoon hours in the plant rooms, from four to six, his mind was on my appointment, as was proved by the crop of new slants and ideas that poured out of him when he came down to the kitchen. Except for a trip to Leonard Street to answer an hour’s worth of questions by an assistant district attorney, my day was devoted to it, too. My most useful errand - though at the time it struck me as a waste of time and money - was one made to Doc Vollmer for a prescription and then to a drugstore, under instructions from Wolfe.


When I got back from the D.A.’s office Saul and I got in the sedan and went for a reconnaissance. We didn’t stop at 51st Street and 11th Avenue but drove past it four times. The main idea was to find a place for Saul. He and Wolfe both insisted that he had to be there.
We finally settled for a filling station across the street from the lunchroom. Saul was to have a taxi drive in there at eight o’clock, and stay in the passenger’s seat while the driver tried to get his carburetor adjusted. There were so many contingencies to be agreed on that if it had been anyone but Saul I wouldn’t have expected him to remember more than half. For instance, in case I left the lunchroom and got in my car and drove off, Saul was not to follow unless I cranked my window down.
==> Trying to provide for contingencies was okay, in a way, but actually it was strictly up to me, since I had to let the other guy make the rules. And with the other guy making the rules no one gets very far, not even Nero Wolfe arranging for contingencies ahead of time. <==
Saul left before I did, to find a taxi driver that he liked the looks of. When I went to the hall for my hat and raincoat, Wolfe came along.
"I still don’t like the idea," he insisted, "of your having that thing in your pocket. I think you should slip it inside your sock."
"I don’t." I was putting the raincoat on. "If I get frisked, a sock is as easy to feel as a pocket."
"You’re sure that gun is loaded?"
"I never saw you so anxious. Next you’ll be telling me to put on my rubbers." He even opened the door for me.

"I talked to her. I talked a little first." His head gave a quick jerk, as if a fly were bothering him and his hands were too occupied to attend to it. "What did she tell you?"
"About that day at Doris Hatten’s apartment - you coming in and her going out. And of course her recognizing you there yesterday."
"She is dead. There is no evidence. You can’t prove anything."
I grinned. "Then you’re wasting a lot of time and energy and the best disguise I ever saw. Why didn’t you just toss my note in the wastebasket? ... Let me answer. You didn’t dare. In getting evidence, knowing exactly what and who to look for makes all the difference. You knew I knew."
"And you haven’t told the police?" "No."
==> "Nor Nero Wolfe?" <==
"No."
"Why not?"
I shrugged. "I may not put it very well," I said, "because this is the first time I have ever talked with my hands and feet tied, and I find it cramps my style. But it strikes me as the kind of coincidence that doesn’t happen very often. I’m fed

 up with the detective business, and I’d like to quit. I have something that’s worth a good deal to you - say, fifty thousand dollars. It can be arranged so that you get what you pay for. I’ll go the limit on that, but it has to be closed quick. If you don’t buy, I’m going to have a tough time explaining why I didn’t remember sooner what she told me. Twenty-four hours from now is the absolute limit."

There was a sudden noise in his throat as if he had started to choke. He stood up. "You’re working your hand loose," he said huskily, and moved toward me.
It might have been guessed from his voice, thick and husky from the blood rushing to his head, but it was plain as day in his eyes, suddenly fixed and glassy, like a blind man’s eyes. Evidently he had come there fully intending to kill me, and had now worked himself up to it.
"Hold it!" I snapped at him.
He halted, muttering, "You’re getting your hand loose," and moved again, passing me to get behind.
I jerked my body and the chair violently aside and around, and had him in front of me again.
==> "No good," I told him. "They only went down one flight. I heard ‘em. It’s no good, anyway. I’ve got another note for you - from Nero Wolfe - here in my breast pocket. Help yourself, but stay in front of me." <==
He was only two steps from me, but it took him four small, slow ones. His gloved hand went inside my coat to the breast pocket, and came out with a folded slip of yellow paper. From the way his eyes looked, I doubted if he would be able to read, but apparently he was. I watched his face as he took it in, in Wolfe’s precise handwriting:
"If Mr. Goodwin is not home by midnight the information given him by Cynthia Brown will be communicated to the police, and I shall see that they act

 immediately. NERO WOLFE."
He looked at me, and slowly his eyes changed. No longer glassy, they began to let light in. Before, he had just been going to kill me. Now, he hated me.

He had started to tremble, and knew it, and was trying to stop.
"Maybe," I conceded, "you can’t get that much that quick. In that case he’ll take your I.O.U. - you can write it on the back of that note he sent you. My pen’s here in my vest pocket. He’ll be reasonable."
"I’m not such a fool," he said harshly.
"Who said you were?" I was sharp and urgent, and thought I had loosened him. "Use your head, that’s all. We’ve either got you cornered or we haven’t. If we haven’t, what are you doing here? If we have, a little thing like your name signed to an I.O.U won’t make it any worse. He won’t press you too hard. Here, get my pen, right here."
I still think I had loosened him. It was in his eyes and the way he stood, sagging a little. If my hands had been free, so I could have got the pen myself, and uncapped it and put it between his fingers, I would have had him. I had him to the point of writing and signing, but not to the point of taking my pen out of my pocket. But, of course, if my hands had been free I wouldn’t have been bothering about an I.O.U and a pen.
==> So he slipped from under. He shook his head, and his shoulders stiffened. The hate that filled his eyes was in his voice, too: "You said twenty-four hours. That gives me tomorrow. I’ll have to decide. Tell Nero Wolfe I’ll decide." <==
He crossed to the door and pulled it open. He went out, closing the door, and I

 heard his steps descending the stairs; but he hadn’t taken his hat and coat, and I nearly cracked my temples trying to use my brain. I hadn’t got far when there were steps on the stairs again, coming up, and in they came, all three of them.
My host spoke to Skinny: "What time does your watch say?" Skinny glanced at his wrist. "Nine thirty-two."
"At half-past ten untie his left hand. Leave him like that and go. It will take him five minutes or more to get his other hand and his feet free. Have you any objection to that?"

I had been there maybe eight or ten minutes, and was getting relaxed and a little less bitter, when the door opened and she came in. Her companions were not along. By the time she had closed the door and turned to me I had got to my feet, with a friendly leer, and had begun, "I was just sitting here thinking -"
The look on her face stopped me. There was nothing wrong with it basically, but something had got it out of kilter. She headed for me, got halfway, jerked to a stop, sank into one of the yellow chairs, and squeaked, "Could I have a drink?"
"Sure thing." I said. I went to the cupboard and got a hooker of old whiskey. Her hand was shaking as she took the glass, but she didn’t spill any, and she got it down in two swallows.
"Did I need that!" "More?"
She shook her head. Her bright brown eyes were moist from the whiskey, as she gave me a full, straight look with her head tilted up.
==> "You’re Archie Goodwin," she stated. <==


I nodded. "And you’re the Queen of Egypt?"
"I’m a baboon," she declared. "I don’t know how they ever taught me to talk." She looked around for something to put the glass on, and I moved a step and reached for it. "Look at my hand shake," she complained.
She kept her hand out, looking at it, so I took it in mine and gave it some friendly but gentle pressure. "You do seem a little upset," I conceded.

"Her maid found her body the next morning. The papers said she had been killed the day before. That man killed her. There wasn’t a word about him - no one had seen him enter or leave. And I didn’t open my mouth! I was a rotten coward!"
"And today, all of a sudden, there he is, looking at orchids?" "Yes."
"Are you sure he knows you recognized him?"
"Yes. He looked straight at me, and his eyes -"
She was stopped by the house phone buzzing. Stepping to my desk, I picked it up and asked it, "Well?"
==> Nero Wolfe’s voice, peevish, came: "Archie!" <==
"Yes, sir."
"What the devil are you doing? Come back up here!" "Pretty soon. I’m talking with a prospective client -" "This is no time for clients! Come at once!"
The connection went. He had slammed it down. I hung up and went back to the prospective client: "Mr. Wolfe wants me upstairs. Do you want to wait here?"
"Yes."
"If Mrs. Orwin asks about you?"

I got impatient: "What’s his name? This bird you recognized."
"I don’t know."
"Describe him."
She thought it over a little, gazing at me, and then shook her head. "Not now. I want to see what Nero Wolfe says first."
She must have seen something in my eyes, or thought she did, for suddenly she came up out of her chair and moved to me and put a hand on my arm. "That’s all I mean," she said earnestly. "It’s not you - I know you’re all right. I might as well tell you - you’d never want any part of me anyhow - this is the first time in years, I don’t know how long, that I’ve talked to a man straight - you know, just human. I - "She stopped for a word, and a little color showed in her cheeks. "I’ve enjoyed it very much."
==> "Good. Me, too. Call me Archie. I’ve got to go, but describe him." <==
But she hadn’t enjoyed it that much. "Not until Nero Wolfe says he’ll do it," she said firmly.
I had to leave it at that, knowing as I did that in three more minutes Wolfe might have a fit. Out in the hall I had the notion of passing the word to Saul and Fritz to give departing guests a good look, but rejected it because (a) they weren’t there, both of them presumably being busy in the cloakroom, (b) he might have departed already, and (c) I had by no means swallowed a single word of Cynthia’s story, let alone the whole works.
Up in the plant-rooms there were plenty left. When I came into Wolfe’s range he darted me a glance of cold fury, and I turned on the grin. Anyway, it was a quarter to five, and if they took the hint on the invitation it wouldn’t last much longer.
They didn’t take the hint on the dot, but it didn’t bother me because my mind was occupied. I was now really interested in them - or at least one of them, if he had actually been there and hadn’t gone home.
First, there was a chore to get done. I found the three Cynthia had been with, a

First, there was a chore to get done. I found the three Cynthia had been with, a

 female and two males.
"Mrs. Orwin?" I asked politely.
She nodded at me and said, "Yes?" Not quite tall enough, but plenty plump enough, with a round, full face and narrow little eyes that might have been better if they had been wide open. She struck me as a lead worth following.
==> "I’m Archie Goodwin," I said. "I work here." <==
I would have gone on if I had known how, but I needed a lead myself. Luckily one of the males horned in. "My sister?" he inquired anxiously.
So it was a brother-and-sister act. As far as looks went he wasn’t a bad brother at all. Older than me maybe, but not much. He was tall and straight, with a strong mouth and jaw and keen gray eyes. "My sister?" he repeated.
"I guess so. You are -?" "Colonel Brown. Percy Brown."
"Yeah." I switched back to Mrs. Orwin: "Miss Brown asked me to tell you that she went home. I gave her a little drink and it seemed to help, but she decided to leave. She asked me to apologize for her."
"She’s perfectly healthy," the colonel asserted. He sounded a little hurt. "Is she all right?" Mrs. Orwin asked.

 stoop.
"Tail?" Saul muttered to me.
I shook my head and was parting my lips to mutter something back, when a sound came from behind us that made us both whirl around - a screech from a woman, not loud but full of feeling. As we whirled, Fritz and the guest he had been serving came out of the front room, and all four of us saw the woman in the caracul coat come running out of the office into the hall. She kept coming, gasping something, and the guest, making a noise like an alarmed male, moved to meet her. I moved faster, needing about eight jumps to the office door and two inside. There I stopped.
Of course, I knew the thing on the floor was Cynthia, but only because I had left her in there in those clothes. With the face blue and contorted, the tongue halfway out and the eyes popping, it could have been almost anybody. I knelt down and slipped my hand inside her dress front, kept it there ten seconds, and felt nothing.
Saul’s voice came from behind: "I’m here."
==> I got up and went to the phone on my desk and started dialing, telling Saul "No one leaves. We’ll keep what we’ve got. Have the door open for Doc Vollmer." After only two whirs the nurse answered and put Vollmer on, and I snapped it at him: "Doc, Archie Goodwin. Come on the run. Strangled woman... Yeah, strangled." <==
I pushed the phone back, reached for the house phone, and buzzed the plant - rooms, and after a wait had Wolfe’s irritated bark in my ear; "Yes?"
"I’m in the office. You’d better come down. That prospective client I mentioned is here on the floor strangled. I think she’s done, but I’ve sent for Vollmer."
"Is this flummery?" he roared.
"No, sir. Come down and look at her and then ask me."
The connection went. He had slammed it down. I got a sheet of thin tissue paper from a drawer, tore off a corner, and placed it carefully over Cynthia’s mouth and nostrils.

Wolfe, who had already been too close to too many women that day to suit him, tried to jerk away, but she hung on. She was the big-boned, flat-chested, athletic type, and it could have been quite a tussle, with him weighing twice as much as her and four times as big around, if Saul hadn’t rescued him by coming in between and prying her loose. That didn’t stop her tongue, but Wolfe ignored it and came on toward me: "Has Dr. Vollmer come?"
"Yes, sir."
The executive vice - president emerged from the office, talking: "Mr. Wolfe, my name is Homer N. Carlisle and I insist -"
"Shut up," Wolfe growled. On the sill of the door to the office, he faced the audience. "Flower lovers," he said with bitter scorn. "You told me, Mr. McNab, a distinguished group of sincere and devoted gardeners. Pfui! ... Saul!"
"Yes, sir."
==> "Put them all in the dining-room and keep them there. Let no one touch anything around this door, especially the knob ... Archie, come with me." <==
He wheeled and entered the office. Following, I used my foot to swing the door

 neatly shut, leaving no crack but not latching it. When I turned, Vollmer was standing, facing Wolfe’s scowl.
"Well?" Wolfe demanded.
"Dead," Vollmer told him. "With asphyxiation from strangling."

"Guilt," said the black-haired guest emphatically. "The compression got unbearable and he exploded. I’m a psychiatrist."
"Good for you." I took his elbow and turned him. "Go back in and watch all of

 ‘em. With that wall mirror you can include yourself."
"This is illegal," stated Colonel Brown, who had scrambled to his feet. Saul herded them to the rear.
==> Fritz got hold of my sleeve: "Archie, I’ve got to ask Mr. Wolfe about dinner." <==
"Nuts," I said savagely. "By dinner-time this place will be more crowded than it was this afternoon."
"But he has to eat; you know that."
"Nuts," I said. I patted him on the shoulder. "Excuse my manners, Fritz; I’m upset. I’ve just strangled a young woman."
"Phooey," he said scornfully.
"I might as well have," I declared.

 fact above referred to, but neither Cramer nor I had.
Cramer called a recess on the questions to take steps. He called men in and gave orders. Colonel Brown was to be photographed and fingerprinted, and headquarters records were to be checked for him and Cynthia. The file on the murder of Doris Hatten was to be brought to him at once. The lab reports were to be rushed. Saul Panzer and Fritz Brenner were to be brought in.
They came. Fritz stood like a soldier at attention, grim and grave. Saul, only five feet seven, with the sharpest eyes and one of the biggest noses I have ever seen, in his unpressed brown snit and his necktie crooked - he stood like Saul, not slouching and not stiff. Of course, Cramer knew both of them.
"You and Fritz were in the hall all afternoon?" Saul nodded. "The hall and the front room, yes." "Who did you see enter or leave the office?"
==> "I saw Archie go in about four o’clock - I was just coming out of the front room with someone’s hat and coat. I saw Mrs. Carlisle come out just after she screamed. In between those two I saw no one either enter or leave. We were busy most of the time, either in the hall or the front room." <==
Cramer grunted. "How about you, Fritz?"
"I saw no one." Fritz spoke louder than usual. "I would like to say something." "Go ahead."
"I think a great deal of all this disturbance is unnecessary. My duties here are of the household and not professional, but I cannot help hearing what reaches my ears. Many times Mr. Wolfe has found the answer to problems that were too much for you. This happened here in his own house, and I think it should be left entirely to him."
I yooped, "Fritz, I didn’t know you had it in you!"
Cramer was goggling at him. "Wolfe told you to say that, huh?"

"About how many names?"
"Two hundred and nineteen."
"This place wouldn’t hold that many."
Saul nodded. "They came and went. There wasn’t more than a hundred or so at any one time."
"That’s a help." Cramer was getting more and more disgusted, and I didn’t blame him. "Goodwin says he was there at the door with you when that woman screamed and came running out of the office, but that you hadn’t seen her enter the office. Why not?"
==> "We had our backs turned. We were watching a man who had just left. Archie had asked him for his name and he had said that was ridiculous. If you want it, his name is Malcolm Vedder." <==
"How do you know?"
"I had checked him in with the rest."
Cramer stared. "Are you telling me that you could fit that many names to that many faces after seeing them once?"



[line number in individual story] matching line = 253    window = 248 258

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 38018    window = 38013 38023


Saul’s shoulders went slightly up and down. "There’s more to people than faces. I might go wrong on a few, but not many."
Cramer spoke to a dick standing by the door: "You heard that name, Levy - Malcolm Vedder. Tell Stebbins to check it on that list and send a man to bring him in."
Cramer returned to Saul: "Put it this way: Say I sit you here with that list, and a man or woman is brought in -"
"I could tell you positively whether the person had been here or not, especially if he was wearing the same clothes and hadn’t been disguised. On fitting him to his name I might go wrong in a few cases, but I doubt it."
"I don’t believe you."
==> "Mr. Wolfe does," Saul said complacently. "Archie does. I have developed my faculties." <==
"You sure have. All right; that’s all for now. Stick around."
Saul and Fritz went. Wolfe, in his own chair at the end of the dining table, where ordinarily, at this hour, he sat for a quite different purpose, heaved a deep sigh and closed his eyes. I, seated beside Cramer at the side of the table which put us facing the door to the hall, was beginning to appreciate the problem we were up against.
"Goodwin’s story," Cramer growled. "I mean her story. What do you think?"
Wolfe’s eyes came open a little. "What followed seems to support it. I doubt if she would have arranged for that" - he flipped a hand in the direction of the office across the hall - "just to corroborate a tale. I accept it."
"Yeah. I don’t need to remind you that I know you well and I know Goodwin well. So I wonder how much chance there is that in a day or so you’ll suddenly remember that she had been here before, or one or more of the others had, and you’ve got a client, and there was something leading up to this."

I read it over three times. I looked at Wolfe. He had put an envelope in the typewriter and was consulting the phone book. He began pecking, addressing the envelope. I waited until he had finished and rolled the envelope out.
"Just like this?" I asked. "No name or initials signed?" "No."
"I admit it’s nifty," I admitted. "We could forget the calculation and send this to every guy on that list and wait to see who phoned."
"I prefer to send it only to one person - the one indicated by your report of that conversation. That will test the calculation."
"And save postage." I glanced at the paper. "The extreme danger, I suppose, is that I’ll get strangled."
==> "I don’t want to minimize the risk of this, Archie." <==
"Neither do I. I’ll have to borrow a gun from Saul - ours are in the office... May I have that envelope? I’ll have to go to Times Square to mail it."
"Yes. Before you do so, copy that note. Keep Saul here in the morning. If and when the phone call comes you will have to use your wits to arrange the appointment advantageously."
"Right. The envelope, please."

"Right. The envelope, please."


He handed it to me.
That Tuesday morning I was kept busy from eight o’clock on by the phone and the doorbell. After nine, Saul was there to help, but not with the phone, because the orders were that I was to answer all calls. They were mostly from newspapers, but there were a couple from Homicide and a few scattered ones. I took them on the extension in the kitchen.
==> Every time I lifted the thing and told the transmitter, "Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie Goodwin speaking," my pulse went up a notch, and then had to level off again. I had one argument, with a bozo in the District Attorney’s office who had the strange idea that he could order me to report for an interview at eleven-thirty sharp, which ended by my agreeing to call later to fix an hour. <==
A little before eleven I was in the kitchen with Saul, who, at Wolfe’s direction, had been briefed to date, when the phone rang.
"Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie Goodwin speaking." "Mr. Goodwin?"
"Right."
"You sent me a note."
My hand wanted to grip the phone the way Vedder had gripped the flowerpot, but I wouldn’t let it.

"But he has to eat; you know that."
"Nuts," I said. I patted him on the shoulder. "Excuse my manners, Fritz; I’m upset. I’ve just strangled a young woman."
"Phooey," he said scornfully.
"I might as well have," I declared.
The doorbell rang. It was the first consignment of cops.
==> In my opinion, Inspector Cramer made a mistake. It is true that in a room where a murder has occurred the city scientists may shoot the works. And they do. But, except in rare circumstances, the job shouldn’t take all week, and in the case of our office a couple of hours should have been ample. In fact, it was. By eight o’clock the scientists were through. But Cramer, like a sap, gave the order to seal it up until further notice, in Wolfe’s hearing. He knew that Wolfe spent at least three hundred evenings a year in there, and that was why he did it. <==
It was a mistake. If he hadn’t made it, Wolfe might have called his attention to a certain fact as soon as Wolfe saw it himself, and Cramer would have been saved a lot of trouble.
The two of them got the fact at the same time, from me. We were in the dining- room - this was shortly after the scientists had got busy in the office, and the guests, under guard, had been shunted to the front room - and I was relating my conversation with Cynthia Brown. Whatever else my years as Wolfe’s assistant may have done for me or to me, they have practically turned me into a tape recorder. I gave them the real thing, word for word. When I finished, Cramer had a slew of questions, but Wolfe not a one. Maybe he had already focused on the

 fact above referred to, but neither Cramer nor I had.
Cramer called a recess on the questions to take steps. He called men in and gave orders. Colonel Brown was to be photographed and fingerprinted, and headquarters records were to be checked for him and Cynthia. The file on the murder of Doris Hatten was to be brought to him at once. The lab reports were to be rushed. Saul Panzer and Fritz Brenner were to be brought in.

They came. Fritz stood like a soldier at attention, grim and grave. Saul, only five feet seven, with the sharpest eyes and one of the biggest noses I have ever seen, in his unpressed brown snit and his necktie crooked - he stood like Saul, not slouching and not stiff. Of course, Cramer knew both of them.

"We had our backs turned. We were watching a man who had just left. Archie had asked him for his name and he had said that was ridiculous. If you want it, his name is Malcolm Vedder."
"How do you know?"
"I had checked him in with the rest."
Cramer stared. "Are you telling me that you could fit that many names to that many faces after seeing them once?"

Saul’s shoulders went slightly up and down. "There’s more to people than faces. I might go wrong on a few, but not many."
Cramer spoke to a dick standing by the door: "You heard that name, Levy - Malcolm Vedder. Tell Stebbins to check it on that list and send a man to bring him in."
Cramer returned to Saul: "Put it this way: Say I sit you here with that list, and a man or woman is brought in -"

"I don’t believe you."

Saul and Fritz went. Wolfe, in his own chair at the end of the dining table, where ordinarily, at this hour, he sat for a quite different purpose, heaved a deep sigh and closed his eyes. I, seated beside Cramer at the side of the table which put us facing the door to the hall, was beginning to appreciate the problem we were up against.

"Goodwin’s story," Cramer growled. "I mean her story. What do you think?"
Wolfe’s eyes came open a little. "What followed seems to support it. I doubt if she would have arranged for that" - he flipped a hand in the direction of the office across the hall - "just to corroborate a tale. I accept it."
"Yeah. I don’t need to remind you that I know you well and I know Goodwin well. So I wonder how much chance there is that in a day or so you’ll suddenly remember that she had been here before, or one or more of the others had, and you’ve got a client, and there was something leading up to this."
"Bosh," Wolfe said dryly. "Even if it were like that - and it isn’t - you would be wasting time, since you know us."

A dick came to relay a phone call from a deputy commissioner. Another dick came in to say that Homer Carlisle was raising the roof in the front room. Meanwhile, Wolfe sat with his eyes shut, but I got an idea of his state of mind from the fact that intermittently his forefinger was making little circles on the polished top of the table.
==> Cramer looked at him. "What do you know," he asked abruptly, "about the killing of that Doris Hatten?" <==
"Newspaper accounts," Wolfe muttered. "And what Mr. Stebbins has told Mr. Goodwin, casually."
"Casual is right." Cramer got out a cigar, conveyed it to his mouth, and sank his teeth in it. He never lit one. "Those houses with self-service elevators are worse than walk-ups for a checking job. No one ever sees anyone coming or going. Even so, the man who paid the rent for that apartment was lucky. He may have been clever and careful, but also he was lucky never to have anybody see him enough to give a description of him."
"Possibly Miss Hatten paid the rent herself."
"Sure," Cramer conceded, "she paid it all right, but where did she get it from? No, it was that kind of a set-up. She had only been living there two months, and when we found out how well the man who paid for it had kept himself covered, we decided that maybe he had installed her there just for that purpose. That was why we gave it all we had. Another reason was that the papers started hinting that we knew who he was and that he was such a big shot we were sitting on the lid."
Cramer shifted his cigar one tooth over to the left. "That kind of thing used to get me sore, but what the heck; for newspapers that’s just routine. Big shot or not, he didn’t need us to do any covering for him - he did too good a job himself. Now, if we’re to take it the way this Cynthia Brown gave it to Goodwin, it was the man who paid the rent.

"How could there be anything else?" Carlisle blurted.
Cramer ignored him. "Goodwin, here, saw you standing in the hall not more than two minutes, probably less, prior to the moment you screamed and ran out of the office. How long had you then been downstairs?"

"Were you and your husband together all the time?"
"Of course. Well - you know how it is ... He would want to look longer at something, and I would -"
"Certainly we were," Carlisle said irritably. "You can see why I made that remark about it depending on what she said. She has a habit of being vague."
"I’m not actually vague," she protested. "It’s just that everything is relative. Who would have thought my wish to see Nero Wolfe’s office would link me with a crime?"
Carlisle exploded. "Hear that? Link!"

"Yes, I had read about it, and I wanted to see how it looked. I thought a globe that size, three feet in diameter, would be fantastic in an ordinary room - Oh!"
"Oh, what?"
"I didn’t see it!"
Cramer nodded. "You saw something else, instead. By the way, I forgot to ask -

 Did you know her?"
"You mean - her?"
"We had never known her or seen her or heard of her." the husband declared.
"Had you, Mrs. Carlisle?"

"Had you, Mrs. Carlisle?"
"No."
"Of course. She wasn’t a member of this flower club. Are you a member?"
"My husband is."
"We both are," Carlisle stated. "Vague again. It’s a joint membership. Isn’t this about enough?"
==> "Plenty," Cramer conceded. "Thank you, both of you. We won’t bother you again unless we have to... Levy, pass them out." <==
When the door had closed behind them Cramer glared at me and then at Wolfe. "This is sure a sweet one," he said grimly. "Say it’s within the range of possibility that Carlisle is it, and the way it stands right now, why not? So we look into him. We check back on him for six months, and try doing it without getting roars out of him - a man like that in his position. However, it can be done - by three or four men in two or three weeks. Multiply that by what? How many men were here?"
"Around a hundred and twenty," I told him. "But you’ll find that at least half of them are disqualified one way or another. As I told you, I took a survey. Say sixty."
"All right, multiply it by sixty. Do you care for it?"
"No," I said.
"Neither do I." Cramer took the cigar from his mouth. "Of course," he said sarcastically, "when she sat in there telling you about him the situation was different. You wanted her to enjoy being with you. You couldn’t reach for the phone and tell us you had a self-confessed crook who could put a quick finger on a murderer and let us come and take over. No!

"Don’t be vulgar," I said severely.
"You had to go upstairs and make a survey! You had to - Well?"
Lieutenant Rowcliff had opened the door and entered. There were some city employees I liked, some I admired, some I had no feeling about, some I could have done without easy - and one whose ears I was going to twist some day. That was Rowcliff. He was tall, strong, handsome, and a pain in the neck.

"We’re all through in there, sir," he said importantly. "We’ve covered everything. Nothing is being taken away, and it is all in order. We were especially careful with the contents of the drawers of Wolfe’s desk, and also we -"
"My desk!" Wolfe roared.
"Yes, your desk," Rowcliff said precisely, smirking.
The blood was rushing into Wolfe’s face.
==> "She was killed there," Cramer said gruffly. "Did you get anything at all?" <==
"I don’t think so," Rowcliff admitted. "Of course, the prints have to be sorted, and there’ll be lab reports. How do we leave it?"
"Seal it up and we’ll see tomorrow. You stay here and keep a photographer. The others can go. Tell Stebbins to send that woman in - Mrs. Irwin."
"Orwin, sir."
"Wait a minute," I objected. "Seal what up? The office?"
"Certainly," Rowcliff sneered.

"Go ahead. Lieutenant," Cramer told Rowcliff, and he wheeled and went.

I was full of both feelings and words, but I knew they had to be held in. This was far and away the worst Cramer had ever pulled. It was up to Wolfe. I looked at him. He was white with fury, and his mouth was pressed to so tight a line that there were no lips.
"It’s routine," Cramer said aggressively.

Wolfe’s head came forward an inch, his chin out. "No, Mr. Cramer. I’ll tell you what it is. It is the malefic spite of a sullen little soul and a crabbed and envious mind. It is the childish rancor of a primacy too often challenged and offended. It is the feeble wiggle -"

He leaned across the table at Cramer, extending a hand:
"Inspector Cramer? I’ve been hearing about you for years! I’m Eugene Orwin." He glanced at his right. "I’ve already had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Wolfe and Mr. Goodwin - earlier today, before this terrible thing happened. It is terrible."
"Yes," Cramer agreed. "Sit down."

"Then here are the facts: In January my mother was in Florida. You meet all kinds in Florida. My mother met a man who called himself Colonel Percy Brown - a British colonel in the reserve, he said. Later on, he introduced his sister Cynthia to her. My mother saw a great deal of them. My father is dead, and the estate, a rather large one, is in her control. She lent Brown some money, not much - that was just an opener."
Mrs. Orwin’s head jerked up. "It was only five thousand dollars and I didn’t promise him anything," she said wearily.
"All right, Mother." Gene patted her shoulder. "A week ago she returned to New York and they came along. The first time I met them I thought they were impostors. They weren’t very free with family details, but from them and Mother, chiefly Mother, I got enough to inquire about, and sent a cable to London. I got a reply Saturday and another one this morning and there was more than enough to confirm my suspicion, but not nearly enough to put it up to my mother. When she likes people she can be very stubborn about them.
"I was thinking it over, what step to take next. Meanwhile, I thought it best not to let them be alone with her if I could help it. That’s why I came here with them today - my mother is a member of that flower club - I’m no gardener myself -"
He turned a palm up. "That’s what brought me here. My mother came to see the orchids, and she invited Brown and his sister to come, simply because she is goodhearted. But actually she knows nothing about them."
==> He put his hands on the table and leaned on them, forward at Cramer. "I’m going to be quite frank, Inspector. Under the circumstances, I can’t see that it would serve any useful purpose to let it be published that that woman came here with my mother. I want to make it perfectly clear that we have no desire to evade our <==

 responsibility as citizens. But how would it help to get my mother’s name in the headlines?"
"Names in headlines aren’t what I’m after," Cramer told him, "but I don’t run the newspapers. If they’ve already got it I can’t stop them. I’d like to say I appreciate your frankness. So you only met Miss Brown a week ago?"
Cramer had plenty of questions for both mother and son. It was in the middle of them that Wolfe passed me a slip of paper on which he had scribbled:
"Tell Fritz to bring sandwiches and coffee for you and me. Also for those left in the front room. No one else. Of course, Saul and Theodore."

Gene stayed cooperative to the end, and Mrs. Orwin tried, though it was an effort. They said they had been together all the time, which I happened to know wasn’t so, having seen them separated at least twice during the afternoon, and Cramer did too, since I had told him.
They said a lot of other things, among them that they hadn’t left the plant - rooms between their arrival and their departure with Wolfe; that they had stayed until most of the others were gone because Mrs. Orwin wanted to persuade Wolfe to sell her some plants; that Colonel Brown had wandered off by himself once or twice; that they had been only mildly concerned about Cynthia’s absence, because of assurances from Colonel Brown and me; and so on.

They said a lot of other things, among them that they hadn’t left the plant - rooms between their arrival and their departure with Wolfe; that they had stayed until most of the others were gone because Mrs. Orwin wanted to persuade Wolfe to sell her some plants; that Colonel Brown had wandered off by himself once or twice; that they had been only mildly concerned about Cynthia’s absence, because of assurances from Colonel Brown and me; and so on.
Before they left, Gene made another try for a commitment to keep his mother’s name out of it, and Cramer promised to do his best.
Fritz had brought trays for Wolfe and me, and we were making headway with them. In the silence that followed the departure of the Orwins, Wolfe could plainly be heard chewing a mouthful of mixed salad.
Cramer sat frowning at us. He turned his head: "Levy! Get that Colonel Brown in."
"Yes, sir. That man you wanted - Vedder - he’s here." "Then I’ll take him first."

Cramer had plenty of questions for both mother and son. It was in the middle of them that Wolfe passed me a slip of paper on which he had scribbled:
"Tell Fritz to bring sandwiches and coffee for you and me. Also for those left in the front room. No one else. Of course, Saul and Theodore."

Up in the plant - rooms Malcolm Vedder had caught my eye by the way he picked up a flowerpot and held it. As he took a chair across the dining table from Cramer and me, I still thought he was worth another good look, but after his answer to Cramer’s third question I relaxed and concentrated on my sandwiches. He was an actor and had had parts in three Broadway plays. Of course, that explained it. No actor would pick up a flowerpot just normally, like you or me. He would have to dramatize it some way, and Vedder had happened to choose a way that looked to me like fingers closing around a throat.
Now he was dramatizing this by being wrought-up and indignant.

"Typical!" he told Cramer, his eyes flashing and his voice throaty with feeling. "Typical of police clumsiness! Pulling me into this!"
"Yeah," Cramer said sympathetically. "It’ll be tough for an actor, having your picture in the paper. You a member of this flower club?"
No, Vedder said, he wasn’t. He had come with a friend, a Mrs. Beauchamp, and when she had left to keep an appointment he had remained to look at more orchids. They had arrived about three-thirty and he had remained in the plant rooms continuously until leaving.
Cramer went through all the regulation questions, and got all the expected negatives, until he suddenly asked, "Did you know Doris Hatten?"

He ran his fingers through his hair, turned, and made for the door.
Levy looked at Cramer with his brows raised, and Cramer shook his head. The next one in was Bill McNab, garden editor of the Gazette.
"I can’t tell you how much I regret this, Mr. Wolfe," he said miserably. "Don’t try," Wolfe growled.

"You are?"
"Yes, it was my idea. I persuaded Mr. Wolfe to arrange it. He let me word the invitations. And I was congratulating myself on the great success! Then this! What can I do?"
"Sit down a minute," Cramer invited him.

McNab varied the monotony on one detail, at least. He admitted that he had left the plant-rooms three times during the afternoon, once to accompany a departing guest down to the ground floor, and twice to go down alone to check on who had come and who hadn’t. Aside from that, he was more of the same. By now it was beginning to seem not only futile, but silly to spend time on seven or eight of them merely because they happened to be the last to go and so were at hand. Also, it was something new to me from a technical standpoint. I had never seen one stack up like that.
Any precinct dick knows that every question you ask of everybody is aimed at one of the three targets: motive, means, and opportunity. In this case there were no questions to ask, because those were already answered.

==> As soon as Bill McNab had been sent on his way, Col. Percy Brown was brought in. Brown was not exactly at ease, but he had himself well in hand. You would never have picked him for a con man, and neither would I. His mouth and jaw were strong and attractive, and as he sat down he leveled his keen gray eyes at Cramer and kept them there. He wasn’t interested in Wolfe or me. He said his name was Colonel Percy Brown, and Cramer asked him which army he was a colonel in. <==
"I think," Brown said in a cool, even tone, "it will save time if I state my position: I will answer fully and freely all questions that relate to what I saw, heard, or did since I arrived here this afternoon. Answers to any other questions will have to wait until I consult my attorney."
Cramer nodded. "I expected that. The trouble is I’m pretty sure I don’t give a hoot what you saw or heard this afternoon. We’ll come back to that. I want to put something up to you. As you see, I’m not even wanting to know why you tried to break away before we got here."
"I merely wanted to phone -"
"Forget it. On information received, I think it’s like this: The woman who called herself Cynthia Brown, murdered here today, was not your sister. You met her in Florida six or eight weeks ago. She went in with you on an operation of which Mrs. Orwin was the subject, and you introduced her to Mrs. Orwin as your sister. You two came to New York with Mrs. Orwin a week ago, with the operation well under way. As far as I’m concerned, that is only background. Otherwise, I’m not interested in it. My work is homicide.
"For me," Cramer went on, "the point is that for quite a period you have been closely connected with this Miss Brown, associating with her in a confidential operation. You must have had many intimate conversations with her. You were having her with you as your sister, and she wasn’t, and she’s been murdered. We could give you a merry time on that score alone.

"Do you expect me to believe that during all those weeks she never mentioned the murder of her friend Doris Hatten?"
"I’m sorry I can’t help." Brown’s tone was firm and final.
==> Cramer said, "Okay. We’ll move on to this afternoon. Do you remember a moment when something about Cynthia Brown’s appearance - some movement she made or the expression on her face - caused Mrs. Orwin to ask her what was the matter with her?" <==
A crease was showing on Brown’s forehead. "I’m sorry. I don’t believe I do," he stated.
"I’m asking you to try. Try hard."
Silence. Brown pursed his lips and the crease in his forehead deepened. Finally he said, "I may not have been right there at the moment. In those aisles - in a crowd like that - we weren’t rubbing elbows continuously."
"You do remember when she excused herself because she wasn’t feeling well?" "Yes, of course."
"Well, the moment I’m asking about came shortly before that. She exchanged looks with some man nearby, and it was her reaction to that that made Mrs. Orwin ask her what was the matter. What I’m interested in is that exchange of looks."

"I didn’t see it."
==> Cramer banged his fist on the table so hard the trays danced. "Levy! Take him out and tell Stebbins to send him down and lock him up. Material witness. Put more men on him - he’s got a record somewhere. Find it!" <==
As the door closed behind them, Cramer turned and said, "Gather up, Murphy. We’re leaving."
Levy came back in and Cramer addressed him: "We’re leaving. Tell Stebbins one man out front will be enough - No, I’ll tell him -"
"There’s one more, sir. His name is Nicholson Morley. He’s a psychiatrist." "Let him go. This is getting to be a joke."
Cramer looked at Wolfe. Wolfe looked back at him.
"A while ago," Cramer rasped, "you said something had occurred to you." "Did I?" Wolfe inquired coldly.

Their eyes went on clashing until Cramer broke the connection by turning to go. I restrained an impulse to knock their heads together. They were both being childish. If Wolfe really had something, anything at all, he knew Cramer would gladly trade the seals on the office door for it, sight unseen. And Cramer knew he could make the deal himself with nothing to lose. But they were both too sore and stubborn to show any horse sense.

"Let’s hear it."
Morley got better settled in his chair. "First, I assume that no arrest has been made. Is that correct?"
"Yes - if you mean an arrest with a charge of murder."
"Have you a definite object of suspicion, with or without evidence in support?" "If you mean am I ready to name the murderer, no. Are you?"

==> Cramer’s chin went up. "Well? I’m in charge here." <==
Dr. Morley smiled. "Not quite so fast. The suggestion I have to offer is sound only with certain assumptions." He placed the tip of his right forefinger on the tip of his left little finger. "One: that you have no idea who committed this murder, and apparently you haven’t." He moved over a finger. "Two: that this was not a commonplace crime with a commonplace discoverable motive." To the middle finger. "Three: that nothing is known to discredit the hypothesis that this girl was strangled by the man who strangled Doris Hatten ... May I make those assumptions?"
"You can try. Why do you want to?"
Morley shook his head. "Not that I want to. That if I am permitted to, I have a suggestion. I wish to make it clear that I have great respect for the competence of the police, within proper limits. If the man who murdered Doris Hatten had been vulnerable to police techniques and resources, he would almost certainly have been caught. But he wasn’t. You failed. Why?
"Because he was out of bounds for you. Because your exploration of motive is restricted by your preconceptions." Morley’s black eyes gleamed. "You’re a layman, so I won’t use technical terms.

 investigation. If the personality is twisted, distorted, as it is with a psychotic, then the motives are twisted, too.

When your efforts to find the culprit ended in complete failure, I would have been glad to come forward with a suggestion, but I was as helpless as you."
==> "Get down to it," Cramer muttered. <==
"Yes." Morley put his elbows on the table and paired all his fingertips. "Now, today. On the basis of the assumptions I began with, it is a tenable theory, worthy to be tested, that this was the same man. If so, it is no longer a question of finding him among thousands or millions; it’s a mere hundred or so, and I am willing to contribute my services." The black eyes flashed. "I admit that for a psychiatrist this is a rare opportunity. Nothing could be more dramatic than a psychosis exploding into murder. All you have to do is to have them brought to my office, one at a time -"
"Wait a minute," Cramer put in. "Are you suggesting that we deliver everyone that was here today to your office for you to work on?"
"No, not everyone, only the men. When I have finished I may have nothing that can be used as evidence, but there’s an excellent chance that I can tell you who the strangler is -"
"Excuse me," Cramer said. He was on his feet. "Sorry to cut you off, Doctor, but I must get downtown." He was on his way. "I’m afraid your suggestion wouldn’t work - I’ll let you know -"
He went, and Levy and Murphy with him.

Dr. Morley pivoted his head to watch them go, kept it that way a moment, and then he arose and walked out without a word.

"I want your opinion of this. Assume that we accept without reservation the story Miss Brown told you. Assume also that the man she had recognized, knowing she had recognized him, followed her downstairs and saw her enter the office; that he surmised she intended to consult me; that he postponed joining her in the office, either because he knew you were in there with her or for some other reason; that he saw you come out and go upstairs; that he took an opportunity to enter the office unobserved, got her off guard, killed her, got out unobserved, and returned upstairs."
"I’ll take it that way."
"Very well. Then we have significant indications of his character. Consider it. He has killed her and is back upstairs, knowing that she was in the office talking with you for some time. He would like to know what she said to you. Specifically, he would like to know whether she told you about him, and, if so, how much. Had she or had she not named or described him in his current guise? With that question unanswered, would a man of his character, as indicated, leave the house? Or would he prefer the challenge and risk of remaining until the body had been discovered, to see what you would do? And I, too, of course, after you had talked with me, and the police?"
"Yeah." I chewed my lip. There was a long silence. "So that’s how your mind’s working. I could offer a guess."
"I prefer a calculation to a guess. For that, a basis is needed, and we have it. We know the situation as we have assumed it, and we know something of his character."
==> "Okay," I conceded, "a calculation. The answer I get, he would stick around until the body was found, and if he did, then he is one of the bunch Cramer has been talking with. So that’s what occurred to you, huh?" <==
"No. By no means. That’s a different matter. This is merely a tentative calculation for a starting point. If it is sound, I know who the murderer is."
I gave him a look. Sometimes I can tell how much he is putting on and sometimes I can’t tell. I decided to buy it.


"That’s interesting," I said admiringly. "If you want me to get him on the phone I’ll have to use the one in the kitchen."

"Yes. I still don’t recognize your voice. I don’t think you’re the person I sent the note to."
"I am. It’s good, isn’t it?"
The connection went. I hung up, told Fritz he could answer calls now, and hotfooted it to the stairs and up three flights.
Wolfe was, in the cool-room. When I told him about the call he merely nodded.
"That call," he said, "validates our assumptions and verifies our calculation, but that’s all. Has anyone come to take those seals off?"
==> I told him no. "I asked Stebbins about it and he said he’d ask Cramer." "Don’t ask again," he snapped. "We’ll go down to my room." <==
If the strangler had been in Wolfe’s house the rest of that day he would have felt honored - or anyway he should. Even during Wolfe’s afternoon hours in the plant rooms, from four to six, his mind was on my appointment, as was proved by the crop of new slants and ideas that poured out of him when he came down to the kitchen. Except for a trip to Leonard Street to answer an hour’s worth of questions by an assistant district attorney, my day was devoted to it, too. My most useful errand - though at the time it struck me as a waste of time and money - was one made to Doc Vollmer for a prescription and then to a drugstore, under instructions from Wolfe.


When I got back from the D.A.’s office Saul and I got in the sedan and went for a reconnaissance. We didn’t stop at 51st Street and 11th Avenue but drove past it four times. The main idea was to find a place for Saul. He and Wolfe both insisted that he had to be there.
We finally settled for a filling station across the street from the lunchroom. Saul was to have a taxi drive in there at eight o’clock, and stay in the passenger’s seat while the driver tried to get his carburetor adjusted. There were so many contingencies to be agreed on that if it had been anyone but Saul I wouldn’t have expected him to remember more than half. For instance, in case I left the lunchroom and got in my car and drove off, Saul was not to follow unless I cranked my window down.

Skinny commanded him, "Pin her up! Don’t hurt her."
W-J reached for her. But, as he did so, all of a sudden she was neither man nor woman, but a cyclone. Her first leap, away from his reaching hand, was sidewise, and by the time he had realized he didn’t have her she had got to the table and grabbed the gun. He made for her, and she pulled the trigger, and down he went, tumbling right at her feet. By that time Skinny was almost to her, and she whirled and blazed away again. He kept going, and from the force of the blow on my left shoulder I might have calculated, if I had been in a mood for calculating, that the bullet had not gone through Skinny before it hit me. She pulled the trigger a third time, but by then Skinny had her wrist and was breaking her arm.
"She got me!" W - J was yelling indignantly. "She got me in the leg!"
Skinny had her down on her knees. "Come and cut me loose," I called to him, "and go find a phone."
Except for my wrists and ankles and shoulder and head, I felt fine.
==> "I hope you’re satisfied," Inspector Cramer said sourly. "You and Goodwin have got your pictures in the paper again. You got no fee, but a lot of free publicity. I got my nose wiped." <==
Wolfe grunted comfortably.
The whole squad had been busy with chores: visiting W-J at the hospital; conversing with Mr and Mrs. Carlisle at the D.A.’s office; starting to round up circumstantial evidence to show that Mr. Carlisle had furnished the necessary for Doris Hatten’s rent and Mrs. Carlisle knew it; pestering Skinny; and other items. I had been glad to testify that Skinny, whose name was Herbert Marvel, was one-hundred-proof.

"What I chiefly came for," Cramer went on, "was to let you know that I realize there’s nothing I can do. I know Cynthia Brown described her to Goodwin, and probably gave him her name, too, and Goodwin told you. And you wanted to hog it. I suppose you thought you could pry a fee out of somebody. Both of you suppressed evidence." He gestured. "Okay, I can’t prove it. But I know it, and I want you to know I know it. And I’m not going to forget it."
"The trouble is," Wolfe murmured, "that if you can’t prove you’re right, and of course you can’t, neither can I prove you’re wrong."

==> "What I chiefly came for," Cramer went on, "was to let you know that I realize there’s nothing I can do. I know Cynthia Brown described her to Goodwin, and probably gave him her name, too, and Goodwin told you. And you wanted to hog it. I suppose you thought you could pry a fee out of somebody. Both of you suppressed evidence." He gestured. "Okay, I can’t prove it. But I know it, and I want you to know I know it. And I’m not going to forget it." <==
"The trouble is," Wolfe murmured, "that if you can’t prove you’re right, and of course you can’t, neither can I prove you’re wrong."
"Oh, yes, you can. But you haven’t!" "I would gladly try. How?"
Cramer leaned forward. "Like this: If she hadn’t been described to Goodwin, how did you pick her for him to send that blackmail note to?"
Wolfe shrugged. "It was a calculation, as I told you. I concluded that the murderer was among those who remained until the body had been discovered. It was worth testing. If there had been no phone call in response to Mr. Goodwin’s note, the calculation would have been discredited and I would -"
"Yeah, but why her?"

"There were only two women who remained. Obviously, it couldn’t have been Mrs. Orwin; with her physique she would be hard put to pass as a man. Besides, she is a widow, and it was a sound presumption that Doris Hatten had been killed by a jealous wife, who -"
"But why a woman? Why not a man?"
"Oh, that." Wolfe picked up a glass of beer and drained it with more deliberation than usual. He was having a swell time. "I told you in my dining-room" - he pointed a finger - "that something had occurred to me and I wanted to consider it. Later, I would have been glad to tell you about it if you had not acted so irresponsibly and spitefully in sealing up this office. That made me doubt if you were capable of proceeding properly on any suggestion from me, so I decided to proceed, myself.

"What had occurred to me was simply this, that Miss Brown had told Mr. Goodwin that she wouldn’t have recognized ‘him’ if he hadn’t had a hat on! She

 used the masculine pronoun, naturally, throughout that conversation, because it had been a man who had called at Doris Hatten’s apartment that October day, and he was fixed in her mind as a man. But it was in my plant-rooms that she had seen him that afternoon - and no man wore his hat up there! The men left their hats downstairs. Besides, I was there and saw them. But nearly all the women had hats on." Wolfe upturned a palm. "So it was a woman."
==> Cramer eyed him. "I don’t believe it." he said flatly. <==
"You have a record of Mr. Goodwin’s report of that conversation." "I still wouldn’t believe it."
"There were other little items." Wolfe wiggled a finger, "For example: The strangler of Doris Hatten had a key to the door. But surely the provider, who had so carefully avoided revealment, would not have marched in at an unexpected hour to risk encountering strangers. And who so likely to have found an opportunity, or contrived one, to secure a duplicate key as that provider’s jealous wife?"
"Talk all day. I still don’t believe it."
Well, I thought to myself, observing Wolfe’s smirk and for once completely approving of it, Cramer the office-sealer has his choice of believing it or not.
As for me, I had no choice.

He shook his head, with a fond but manly smile at her. "It’s not necessary, Mimi. Really."
"She’s all right," I assured them, and pushed off, thinking there were a lot of names in this world that could stand a reshuffle. Calling that overweight, narrow - eyed, pearl-and-mink proprietor Mimi was a paradox.
I moved around among the guests, being gracious. Fully aware that I was not equipped with a Geiger counter that would flash a signal if and when I established contact with a strangler, the fact remained that I had been known to have hunches. It would be something for my scrapbook if I picked the killer of Doris Hatten.
Cynthia Brown hadn’t given me the Hatten, only the Doris, but with the context that was enough. At the time it had happened, some five months ago, early in October, the papers had given it a big play, of course. She had been strangled with her own scarf, of white silk with the Declaration of Independence printed on it, in her cozy firth-floor apartment in the West Seventies, and the scarf had been left around her neck, knotted at the back.
==> The cops had never got within a mile of charging anyone, and Sergeant Purley Stebbins of Homicide had told me that they had never even found out who was paying the rent. <==
I kept on the go through the plant-rooms, leaving all switches open for a hunch. Some of them were plainly preposterous, but with everyone else I made an opportunity to exchange some words, full face and close up. That took time, and it was no help to my current and chronic campaign for a raise in wages, since it was the women, not the men, that Wolfe wanted off his neck. I stuck at it, anyhow. It was true that if Cynthia was on the level, we would soon have specifications, but I had had that tingle at the bottom of my spine and I was stubborn.
As I say, it took time, and meanwhile five o’clock came and went and the crowd thinned out. Going on five-thirty, the remaining groups seemed to get the idea all at once that time was up and made for the entrance to the stairs.
I was in the moderate-room when it happened, and the first thing I knew I was alone there, except for a guy at the north bench studying a row of dowianas. He didn’t interest me, as I had already canvassed him and crossed him off as the wrong type for a strangler; but as I glanced his way he suddenly bent forward to

 pick up a pot with a flowering plant, and as he did so I felt my back stiffening. The stiffening was a reflex, but I knew what had caused it; the way his fingers closed around the pot, especially the thumbs. No matter how careful you are of other people’s property, you don’t pick up a five-inch pot as if you were going to squeeze the life out of it.

aka The Affair of the Twisted Scarf
My problems hit a new high that day. What I really felt like doing was to go out for a walk but I wasn’t quite desperate enough for that. So I merely beat it down to the office, shutting the door from the hall behind me, and went and sat at my desk with my feet up, leaned back and closed my eyes, and took a couple of deep breaths.
I had made two mistakes. When Bill McNab, garden editor of the Gazette, had suggested to Nero Wolfe that the members of the Manhattan Flower Club be invited to drop in some afternoon to look at the orchids, I should have fought it.
==> And when the date had been set and the invitations sent, and Wolfe had arranged that Fritz and Saul should do the receiving at the front door and I should stay up in the plant-rooms with him and Theodore, mingling with the guests, if I had had an ounce of brains I would have put my foot down. But I hadn’t, and as a result I had been up there a good hour and a half, grinning around and acting pleased and happy... "No, sir, that’s not a brasso, it’s a laelia." ... "Quite all right, madam - your sleeve happened to hook it. It’ll bloom again next year." <==
It wouldn’t have been so bad if there had been something for the eyes. It was understood that the Manhattan Flower Club was choosy about whom it took in, but obviously its standards were totally different from mine. The men were just men; okay as men go. But the women! It was a darned good thing they had picked on flowers to love, because flowers don’t have to love back.
There had, in fact, been one - just one. I had got a glimpse of her at the other end of the crowded aisle as I went through the door into the cool - room. From ten paces off she looked absolutely promising, and when I had maneuvered close enough to make her an offer to answer questions if she had any, there was simply no doubt about it - no doubt at all.
The first quick, slanting glance she gave me said plainly that she could tell the difference between a flower and a man, but she just smiled and shook her head,

 and moved on with her companions, an older female and two males. Later, I had made another try and got another brush-off, and still later, too long later, feeling that the grin might freeze on me for good if I didn’t take a recess, I went AWOL by worming my way to the far end of the warm-room and sidling on out.

All the way down the three flights of stairs new guests were coming up, though it was then four o’clock. Nero Wolfe’s old brownstone house on West 35th Street had seen no such throng as that within my memory, which is long and good. One flight down, I stopped off at my bedroom for a pack of cigarettes; and another flight down, I detoured to make sure the door of Wolfe’s bedroom was locked.
==> In the main hall downstairs I halted a moment to watch Fritz Brenner, busy at the door with both departures and arrivals, and to see Saul Panzer emerge from the front room, which was being used as a cloakroom, with someone’s hat and topcoat. Then, as aforesaid, I entered the office, shutting the door from the hall behind me, went and sat at my desk with my feet up, leaned back and closed my eyes, and took some deep breaths. <==
I had been there maybe eight or ten minutes, and was getting relaxed and a little less bitter, when the door opened and she came in. Her companions were not along. By the time she had closed the door and turned to me I had got to my feet, with a friendly leer, and had begun, "I was just sitting here thinking -"
The look on her face stopped me. There was nothing wrong with it basically, but something had got it out of kilter. She headed for me, got halfway, jerked to a stop, sank into one of the yellow chairs, and squeaked, "Could I have a drink?"
"Sure thing." I said. I went to the cupboard and got a hooker of old whiskey. Her hand was shaking as she took the glass, but she didn’t spill any, and she got it down in two swallows.
"Did I need that!" "More?"
She shook her head. Her bright brown eyes were moist from the whiskey, as she gave me a full, straight look with her head tilted up.

"Describe him."
She thought it over a little, gazing at me, and then shook her head. "Not now. I want to see what Nero Wolfe says first."
She must have seen something in my eyes, or thought she did, for suddenly she came up out of her chair and moved to me and put a hand on my arm. "That’s all I mean," she said earnestly. "It’s not you - I know you’re all right. I might as well tell you - you’d never want any part of me anyhow - this is the first time in years, I don’t know how long, that I’ve talked to a man straight - you know, just human. I - "She stopped for a word, and a little color showed in her cheeks. "I’ve enjoyed it very much."
"Good. Me, too. Call me Archie. I’ve got to go, but describe him."
But she hadn’t enjoyed it that much. "Not until Nero Wolfe says he’ll do it," she said firmly.
==> I had to leave it at that, knowing as I did that in three more minutes Wolfe might have a fit. Out in the hall I had the notion of passing the word to Saul and Fritz to give departing guests a good look, but rejected it because (a) they weren’t there, both of them presumably being busy in the cloakroom, (b) he might have departed already, and (c) I had by no means swallowed a single word of Cynthia’s story, let alone the whole works. <==
Up in the plant-rooms there were plenty left. When I came into Wolfe’s range he darted me a glance of cold fury, and I turned on the grin. Anyway, it was a quarter to five, and if they took the hint on the invitation it wouldn’t last much longer.
They didn’t take the hint on the dot, but it didn’t bother me because my mind was occupied. I was now really interested in them - or at least one of them, if he had actually been there and hadn’t gone home.
First, there was a chore to get done. I found the three Cynthia had been with, a

 female and two males.

 pick up a pot with a flowering plant, and as he did so I felt my back stiffening. The stiffening was a reflex, but I knew what had caused it; the way his fingers closed around the pot, especially the thumbs. No matter how careful you are of other people’s property, you don’t pick up a five-inch pot as if you were going to squeeze the life out of it.
I made my way around to him. When I got there he was holding the pot so that the flowers were only a few inches from his eyes.
"Nice flower," I said brightly. He nodded.
He leaned to put the pot back, still choking it. I swiveled my head. The only people in sight, beyond the glass partition between us and the cool - room, were Nero Wolfe and a small group of guests, among whom were the Orwin trio and Bill McNab, the garden editor of the Gazette. As I turned my head back to my man he straightened up, pivoted on his heel, and marched off without a word.
I followed him out to the landing and down the three nights of stairs. Along the main hall I was courteous enough not to step on his heel, but a lengthened stride would have reached it. The hall was next to empty. A woman, ready for the street in a caracul coat, was standing there, and Saul Panzer was posted near the front door with nothing to do.
==> I followed my man on into the front room, now the cloakroom, where Fritz Brenner was helping a guest on with his coat. Of course, the racks were practically bare, and with one glance my man saw his property and went to get it. I stepped forward to help, but he ignored me without even bothering to shake his head. I was beginning to feel hurt. <==
When he emerged into the hall I was beside him, and as he moved to the front door I spoke: "Excuse me, but we’re checking guests out as well as in. Your name, please?"
"Ridiculous," he said curtly, and reached for the knob, pulled the door open, and crossed the sill.
Saul, knowing I must have had a reason for wanting to check him out, was at my elbow, and we stood watching his back as he descended the seven steps of the

 stoop.

"Ridiculous," he said curtly, and reached for the knob, pulled the door open, and crossed the sill.
Saul, knowing I must have had a reason for wanting to check him out, was at my elbow, and we stood watching his back as he descended the seven steps of the

 stoop.
"Tail?" Saul muttered to me.
==> I shook my head and was parting my lips to mutter something back, when a sound came from behind us that made us both whirl around - a screech from a woman, not loud but full of feeling. As we whirled, Fritz and the guest he had been serving came out of the front room, and all four of us saw the woman in the caracul coat come running out of the office into the hall. She kept coming, gasping something, and the guest, making a noise like an alarmed male, moved to meet her. I moved faster, needing about eight jumps to the office door and two inside. There I stopped. <==
Of course, I knew the thing on the floor was Cynthia, but only because I had left her in there in those clothes. With the face blue and contorted, the tongue halfway out and the eyes popping, it could have been almost anybody. I knelt down and slipped my hand inside her dress front, kept it there ten seconds, and felt nothing.
Saul’s voice came from behind: "I’m here."
I got up and went to the phone on my desk and started dialing, telling Saul "No one leaves. We’ll keep what we’ve got. Have the door open for Doc Vollmer." After only two whirs the nurse answered and put Vollmer on, and I snapped it at him: "Doc, Archie Goodwin. Come on the run. Strangled woman... Yeah, strangled."
I pushed the phone back, reached for the house phone, and buzzed the plant - rooms, and after a wait had Wolfe’s irritated bark in my ear; "Yes?"
"I’m in the office. You’d better come down. That prospective client I mentioned is here on the floor strangled. I think she’s done, but I’ve sent for Vollmer."

"Is this flummery?" he roared.
"No, sir. Come down and look at her and then ask me."
The connection went. He had slammed it down. I got a sheet of thin tissue paper from a drawer, tore off a corner, and placed it carefully over Cynthia’s mouth and nostrils.


==> Voices had been sounding from the hall. Now one of them entered the office. Its owner was the guest who had been in the cloakroom with Fritz when the screech came. He was a chunky, broad-shouldered guy with sharp, domineering dark eyes and arms like a gorilla’s. His voice was going strong as he started toward me from the door, but it stopped when he had come far enough to get a good look at the object on the floor. <==
"Oh, no." he said huskily. "Yes, sir," I agreed. "How did it happen?" "Don’t know."
"Who is it?" "Don’t know."
He made his eyes come away from it and up until they met mine, and I gave him an A for control. It really was a sight.
"The man at the door won’t let us leave," he stated. "No, sir. You can see why."
"I certainly can." His eyes stayed with me, however. "But we know nothing about it. My name is Carlisle, Homer N. Carlisle. I am the executive vice- president of the North American Foods Company. My wife was merely acting under impulse; she wanted to see the office of Nero Wolfe, and she opened the door and entered. She’s sorry she did, and so am I. We have an appointment, and there’s no reason why we should be detained."

"I certainly can." His eyes stayed with me, however. "But we know nothing about it. My name is Carlisle, Homer N. Carlisle. I am the executive vice- president of the North American Foods Company. My wife was merely acting under impulse; she wanted to see the office of Nero Wolfe, and she opened the door and entered. She’s sorry she did, and so am I. We have an appointment, and there’s no reason why we should be detained."
"I’m sorry, too," I told him, "but for one thing if for nothing else; your wife discovered the body. We’re stuck worse than you are, with a corpse here in our office. So I guess - Hello, Doc."
Vollmer, entering and nodding at me on the fly, was panting a little as he set his black case on the floor and knelt beside it. His house was down the street and he had had only two hundred yards to trot, but he was taking on weight. As he

 opened the case and got out the stethoscope, Homer Carlisle stood and watched with his lips pressed tight, and I did likewise until I heard the sound of Wolfe’s elevator.
==> Crossing to the door and into the hall, I surveyed the terrain. Toward the front, Saul and Fritz were calming down the woman in the caracul coat, now Mrs. Carlisle to me. Nero Wolfe and Mrs. Mimi Orwin were emerging from the elevator. Four guests were coming down the stairs: Gene Orwin, Colonel Percy Brown, Bill McNab, and a middle - aged male with a mop of black hair. I stayed by the office door to block the quartet on the stairs. <==
As Wolfe headed for me, Mrs. Carlisle darted to him and grabbed his arm: "I only wanted to see your office! I want to go! I’m not -"
As she pulled at him and sputtered, I noted a detail: the caracul coat was unfastened, and the ends of a silk scarf, figured and gaily colored, were flying loose. Since at least half of the female guests had sported scarfs, I mention it only to be honest and admit that I had got touchy on that subject.
Wolfe, who had already been too close to too many women that day to suit him, tried to jerk away, but she hung on. She was the big-boned, flat-chested, athletic type, and it could have been quite a tussle, with him weighing twice as much as her and four times as big around, if Saul hadn’t rescued him by coming in between and prying her loose. That didn’t stop her tongue, but Wolfe ignored it and came on toward me: "Has Dr. Vollmer come?"
"Yes, sir."
The executive vice - president emerged from the office, talking: "Mr. Wolfe, my name is Homer N. Carlisle and I insist -"

Wolfe switched to me: "You didn’t notify the police?" "No, sir." I glanced at Vollmer and back. "I need a word."
"I suppose so." He spoke to Doc: "If you will leave us for a moment? The front room?"
Vollmer hesitated, uncomfortable. "As a doctor called to a violent death I’d catch the devil. Of course, I could say -"
"Then go to a corner and cover your ears."
He did so. He went to the farthest corner, the angle made by the partition of the bathroom, pressed his palms to his ears, and stood facing us. I addressed Wolfe with a lowered voice:
==> "I was here and she came in. She was either scared good or putting on a very fine act. Apparently, it wasn’t an act, and I now think I should have alerted Saul and Fritz, but it doesn’t matter what I now think. Last October a woman named Doris Hatten was killed, strangled, in her apartment. No one got elected. Remember?" <==
"Yes."

She said she was a friend of Doris Hatten’s and was at her apartment that day, and saw the man that did the strangling, and that he was here this afternoon. She said he was aware that she had recognized him - that’s why she was scared - and she wanted to get you to help by telling him that we were wise and he’d better lay off. No wonder I didn’t gulp it down. I realize that you dislike complications and therefore might want me to scratch this out, but at the end she touched a soft spot by saying that she had enjoyed my company, so I prefer to open up to the cops."
"Then do so. Confound it!"
I went to the phone and started dialing WAtkins 9 - 8241. Doc Vollmer came out of his corner. Wolfe was pathetic. He moved around behind his desk and lowered himself into his own oversized custom-made number; but there smack in front of him was the object on the floor, so after a moment he made a face, got back onto his feet, grunted like an outraged boar, went across to the other side of the room, to the shelves, and inspected the backbones of books.

But even that pitiful diversion got interrupted. As I finished with my phone call and hung up, sudden sounds of commotion came from the hall. Dashing across, getting fingernails on the edge of the door and pulling it open, I saw trouble. A group was gathered in the open doorway of the dining-room, which was across the hall. Saul Panzer went bounding past me toward the front.
==> At the front door, Col. Percy Brown was stiff-arming Fritz Brenner with one hand and reaching for the doorknob with the other. Fritz, who is chef and housekeeper, is not supposed to double in acrobatics, but he did fine. Dropping to the floor, he grabbed the colonel’s ankles and jerked his feet out from under him. <==
Then I was there, and Saul, with his gun out; and there, with us, was the guest with the mop of black hair.
"You fool," I told the colonel as he sat up. "If you’d got outdoors Saul would have winged you."
"Guilt," said the black-haired guest emphatically. "The compression got unbearable and he exploded. I’m a psychiatrist."
"Good for you." I took his elbow and turned him. "Go back in and watch all of

 ‘em. With that wall mirror you can include yourself."
"This is illegal," stated Colonel Brown, who had scrambled to his feet. Saul herded them to the rear.
==> Fritz got hold of my sleeve: "Archie, I’ve got to ask Mr. Wolfe about dinner." <==
"Nuts," I said savagely. "By dinner-time this place will be more crowded than it was this afternoon."
"But he has to eat; you know that."
"Nuts," I said. I patted him on the shoulder. "Excuse my manners, Fritz; I’m upset. I’ve just strangled a young woman."
"Phooey," he said scornfully.
"I might as well have," I declared.

The doorbell rang. It was the first consignment of cops.
In my opinion, Inspector Cramer made a mistake. It is true that in a room where a murder has occurred the city scientists may shoot the works. And they do. But, except in rare circumstances, the job shouldn’t take all week, and in the case of our office a couple of hours should have been ample. In fact, it was. By eight o’clock the scientists were through. But Cramer, like a sap, gave the order to seal it up until further notice, in Wolfe’s hearing. He knew that Wolfe spent at least three hundred evenings a year in there, and that was why he did it.
It was a mistake. If he hadn’t made it, Wolfe might have called his attention to a certain fact as soon as Wolfe saw it himself, and Cramer would have been saved a lot of trouble.

The two of them got the fact at the same time, from me. We were in the dining- room - this was shortly after the scientists had got busy in the office, and the guests, under guard, had been shunted to the front room - and I was relating my conversation with Cynthia Brown. Whatever else my years as Wolfe’s assistant may have done for me or to me, they have practically turned me into a tape recorder. I gave them the real thing, word for word. When I finished, Cramer had a slew of questions, but Wolfe not a one. Maybe he had already focused on the

 fact above referred to, but neither Cramer nor I had.
==> Cramer called a recess on the questions to take steps. He called men in and gave orders. Colonel Brown was to be photographed and fingerprinted, and headquarters records were to be checked for him and Cynthia. The file on the murder of Doris Hatten was to be brought to him at once. The lab reports were to be rushed. Saul Panzer and Fritz Brenner were to be brought in. <==
They came. Fritz stood like a soldier at attention, grim and grave. Saul, only five feet seven, with the sharpest eyes and one of the biggest noses I have ever seen, in his unpressed brown snit and his necktie crooked - he stood like Saul, not slouching and not stiff. Of course, Cramer knew both of them.
"You and Fritz were in the hall all afternoon?" Saul nodded. "The hall and the front room, yes." "Who did you see enter or leave the office?"
"I saw Archie go in about four o’clock - I was just coming out of the front room with someone’s hat and coat. I saw Mrs. Carlisle come out just after she screamed. In between those two I saw no one either enter or leave. We were busy most of the time, either in the hall or the front room."
Cramer grunted. "How about you, Fritz?"
"I saw no one." Fritz spoke louder than usual. "I would like to say something." "Go ahead."

Cramer returned to Saul: "Put it this way: Say I sit you here with that list, and a man or woman is brought in -"
"I could tell you positively whether the person had been here or not, especially if he was wearing the same clothes and hadn’t been disguised. On fitting him to his name I might go wrong in a few cases, but I doubt it."
"I don’t believe you."
"Mr. Wolfe does," Saul said complacently. "Archie does. I have developed my faculties."
"You sure have. All right; that’s all for now. Stick around."
==> Saul and Fritz went. Wolfe, in his own chair at the end of the dining table, where ordinarily, at this hour, he sat for a quite different purpose, heaved a deep sigh and closed his eyes. I, seated beside Cramer at the side of the table which put us facing the door to the hall, was beginning to appreciate the problem we were up against. <==
"Goodwin’s story," Cramer growled. "I mean her story. What do you think?"
Wolfe’s eyes came open a little. "What followed seems to support it. I doubt if she would have arranged for that" - he flipped a hand in the direction of the office across the hall - "just to corroborate a tale. I accept it."
"Yeah. I don’t need to remind you that I know you well and I know Goodwin well. So I wonder how much chance there is that in a day or so you’ll suddenly remember that she had been here before, or one or more of the others had, and you’ve got a client, and there was something leading up to this."
"Bosh," Wolfe said dryly. "Even if it were like that - and it isn’t - you would be wasting time, since you know us."

He put his hands on the table and leaned on them, forward at Cramer. "I’m going to be quite frank, Inspector. Under the circumstances, I can’t see that it would serve any useful purpose to let it be published that that woman came here with my mother. I want to make it perfectly clear that we have no desire to evade our

 responsibility as citizens. But how would it help to get my mother’s name in the headlines?"
"Names in headlines aren’t what I’m after," Cramer told him, "but I don’t run the newspapers. If they’ve already got it I can’t stop them. I’d like to say I appreciate your frankness. So you only met Miss Brown a week ago?"
Cramer had plenty of questions for both mother and son. It was in the middle of them that Wolfe passed me a slip of paper on which he had scribbled:
==> "Tell Fritz to bring sandwiches and coffee for you and me. Also for those left in the front room. No one else. Of course, Saul and Theodore." <==
I left the room, found Fritz in the kitchen, delivered the message, and returned.
Gene stayed cooperative to the end, and Mrs. Orwin tried, though it was an effort. They said they had been together all the time, which I happened to know wasn’t so, having seen them separated at least twice during the afternoon, and Cramer did too, since I had told him.
They said a lot of other things, among them that they hadn’t left the plant - rooms between their arrival and their departure with Wolfe; that they had stayed until most of the others were gone because Mrs. Orwin wanted to persuade Wolfe to sell her some plants; that Colonel Brown had wandered off by himself once or twice; that they had been only mildly concerned about Cynthia’s absence, because of assurances from Colonel Brown and me; and so on.
Before they left, Gene made another try for a commitment to keep his mother’s name out of it, and Cramer promised to do his best.
Fritz had brought trays for Wolfe and me, and we were making headway with them. In the silence that followed the departure of the Orwins, Wolfe could plainly be heard chewing a mouthful of mixed salad.

"Yes, sir. That man you wanted - Vedder - he’s here." "Then I’ll take him first."


Up in the plant - rooms Malcolm Vedder had caught my eye by the way he picked up a flowerpot and held it. As he took a chair across the dining table from Cramer and me, I still thought he was worth another good look, but after his answer to Cramer’s third question I relaxed and concentrated on my sandwiches. He was an actor and had had parts in three Broadway plays. Of course, that explained it. No actor would pick up a flowerpot just normally, like you or me. He would have to dramatize it some way, and Vedder had happened to choose a way that looked to me like fingers closing around a throat.

That’s wise, I think. I’m willing to discuss the matter. Are you free this evening?"
"I can wiggle free." "With a car to drive?" "Yeah, I have a car."
"Drive to a lunchroom at the north-east corner of Fifty-first Street and Eleventh Avenue. Get there at eight o’clock. Park your car on Fifty-first Street, but not at the corner. You will be alone, of course. Go in the lunchroom and order something to eat. I won’t be there, but you will get a message. You’ll be there at eight?"
"Yes. I still don’t recognize your voice. I don’t think you’re the person I sent the note to."
"I am. It’s good, isn’t it?"
==> The connection went. I hung up, told Fritz he could answer calls now, and hotfooted it to the stairs and up three flights. <==
Wolfe was, in the cool-room. When I told him about the call he merely nodded.
"That call," he said, "validates our assumptions and verifies our calculation, but that’s all. Has anyone come to take those seals off?"
I told him no. "I asked Stebbins about it and he said he’d ask Cramer." "Don’t ask again," he snapped. "We’ll go down to my room."
If the strangler had been in Wolfe’s house the rest of that day he would have felt honored - or anyway he should. Even during Wolfe’s afternoon hours in the plant rooms, from four to six, his mind was on my appointment, as was proved by the crop of new slants and ideas that poured out of him when he came down to the kitchen. Except for a trip to Leonard Street to answer an hour’s worth of questions by an assistant district attorney, my day was devoted to it, too. My most useful errand - though at the time it struck me as a waste of time and money - was one made to Doc Vollmer for a prescription and then to a drugstore, under instructions from Wolfe.
