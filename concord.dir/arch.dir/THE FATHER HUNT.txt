The door opened and two women entered and headed for the elevator. That was
not the place to discuss very personal matters.
She was all right to walk with, no leading or lagging and no silly step-stretching. At that time of day in August there was plenty of room in the back at The Cooler, and we got the corner table where Lily and I had often had a snack. When the waitress had taken our order and left, I asked if she wanted to put off being personal until we had something inside.
She shook her head. "I might as well ..." She let it hang ten seconds and then blurted, "I want you to find my father."
I raised a brow. "Have you lost him?"
==> "No. I haven’t lost him ... because I never had him." She said it fast, as if someone was trying to stop her. "I decided I had to tell somebody - that was a month ago - and then I got this job with Miss Rowan and I found out that she knows you, and I met you, and of course I know about you and Nero Wolfe. But I don’t want Nero Wolfe to do it, I want you to." <==
There were no dimples, and the quick brown eyes were fastened on me.
"That won’t work," I told her. "I’m on full time with Mr. Wolfe, twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week when they’re needed, and I don’t take jobs on my own. But I have a loose hour" - I looked at my watch - "and twenty minutes, and if you want a suggestion I might possibly have one. No charge."
"But I need more than a suggestion."
"You’re not in a position to judge. You’re too involved."

"You’re not in a position to judge. You’re too involved."

I’m involved all right." The eyes stayed at me. "I couldn’t tell this to anybody but you. Not anybody. When I met you last week, the first time, I felt it then, I knew it, that you were the one man in the world that I could trust to do it. I never had that feeling about a man before - or woman either."
"That’s just dandy," I said, "but save the soap. Did you say you never had your father?"

"There must be. Everyone has relatives."
"No. None. Of course there might be some under her real name."
"Have you got any? Cousins, uncles, aunts ..."

 "No."
==> It was getting messy. Or rather, it was getting too damn pure and simple. I knew people who liked to think of themselves as loners, but Amy Denovo really was one; with her it wasn’t just thinking. I suggested that we might try the sandwiches, and she agreed and took one, and took a bite. Naturally, when I am eating with someone, male or female, for the first time, I notice the details of his or her performance, since it tells a lot about the person, but that time I didn’t because the way she took a bite, or chewed, or swallowed, or licked her lips, had no bearing on the fix she was in. I did observe that there was nothing wrong with her appetite, and she proved that she liked the egg-and-anchovy combo by taking her full share. She asked if it was on Nero Wolfe’s list of favorites, and I said no, he would probably sneer at it. When the platter was empty she said she hadn’t thought it would make her hungry, telling someone the secret she had kept bottled up so long, but it had. She gave me a little smile, the dimples coming, and said, "We don’t really know ourselves, do we?" <==
"It depends," I said. "Some of us know too much, and some not enough. I don’t want to know why I get out of bed mornings in a fog, I might never sleep again. To hell with it, I always find my way out. As for you, you’re not in a fog, you’re under a spotlight that you turned on yourself. Why don’t you just turn it off?"
"I did not turn it on myself Other people did it, especially my mother. I can’t turn it off."
"Well, then. What’s your biggest question? Your mother’s real name and so on, or your father?"
"My father, of course. After all, I have lived with my mother all my life, and I suppose my wanting to know her real name and things about her is just ... well, curiosity. But I must know about my father. Is he alive? Who is he? What is he? His genes made me!"
I nodded. "Yeah, you went to Smith. You learned too much about genes. Mr. Wolfe said once that scientists should keep their findings strictly to themselves; by spilling it they just complicate things for other people. Would you like some coffee?"

"They have good sweet things."
She shook her head. "I admit I could eat anything, it’s really amazing, my being so hungry, but I’d rather not. What do you ...? You said you might have a suggestion."

"They have good sweet things."
She shook her head. "I admit I could eat anything, it’s really amazing, my being so hungry, but I’d rather not. What do you ...? You said you might have a suggestion."
"I know I did." I turned a hand over on the table. "You’ve got a tough one. I’m afraid you need more than a suggestion, even from the one man you can trust. Sure, I filed that. To get what you want - there’s one chance in a million that a week or so of poking around would crack it, but it would probably be a long and very expensive job. How much money have you got?"
"Not much. Of course I would want to pay you."
==> "Not me. I explained that. But Nero Wolfe has inflated ideas about fees; that’s why I would have to know exactly how you are fixed. If you care to tell me." <==
"Certainly I’ll tell you. I have never earned any money, not enough to mention, and anyway I’ve spent it. I only have what my mother left, after paying the ... for the cremation. She left instructions about that. There’s a little more than two thousand dollars in the bank, that’s all. There are no debts and I don’t owe anyone anything."
I had a brow up. "What did your mother do for - no, that’s immaterial. She made enough to send you to an expensive college. Unless someone helped?"
"No. She did it all. You were going to ask what she did for a living. She was with a television producer, the same one from as far back as I can remember. I suppose she got fifteen thousand a year, maybe more. She never told me." The quick brown eyes were straight at me. "If I paid Nero Wolfe the two thousand dollars he would have you work on it, wouldn’t he?"
I shook my head. "He wouldn’t even discuss it. He would know it might take a year, and he thinks nothing of billing a client five grand for a one-week job. You said you know about him, but apparently you don’t. He’s pigheaded and high- nosed and toplofty, and he thinks he’s the best detective in the world, and so do I, or I would have moved out long ago. I think you deserve some help with your problem, and you certainly need it, and I like your dimples, but if I told him about you and suggested an appointment he would just glare at me. He would

"Don’t you dare tell her about me!"
"Keep your seat. I wouldn’t dream of telling her, or anyone. I merely thought you might tell her yourself, and - "

"Don’t you dare tell her about me!"
"Keep your seat. I wouldn’t dream of telling her, or anyone. I merely thought you might tell her yourself, and - "
"I wouldn’t tell anybody!"
"Okay, I won’t either. Your eyes have a fine flash." I regarded her. "Look, Miss Denovo. I’m shutting the door only because I have to. Myself, I would like to tackle it because it would probably have some interesting angles and twists and it would be nice to have a client it is a pleasure to look at. Besides, there would be the possibility of having to deal with a murder. When you hear about - "
"Murder?"
==> "Certainly. It’s only a bare possibility, but it popped up because when you hear of a hit-and-run death and the driver hasn’t been tagged, it does pop up. I mention it only because it’s one of the reasons why I would like to tackle it. But there’s not a sliver of a chance with Mr. Wolfe, and there you are. I’m sorry, I really am." <==
She shook her head, with her eyes staying at me. "But Mr. Goodwin. This leaves me helpless." Apparently the murder possibility hadn’t fazed her. "What can I do? I can’t tell somebody else."
That was that. I wasn’t feeling particularly cocky twenty minutes later, as I flagged a taxi headed downtown on Park Avenue and gave the hackie Saul Panzer’s address. Working for and with the best detective in the world - which you don’t have to swallow - is fine, but when you have been told by a pretty girl that you are the one man in the world she can trust, even if it was pure soap, and you have stiff-armed her, you are not on your high horse. I slouched in the taxi and tried to steer my mind back to baseball and the Mets.
It was six minutes to eight when I got out at the corner of Thirty-eighth and Park. As for what happened to my friends’ welfare, not to mention mine, I’ll skip it. Sometimes the cards simply will not cooperate.

==> FOR FRIDAY’S PROGRAM I merely had to follow the script. At a quarter to ten I let myself out of the old brownstone on West Thirty-fifth Street, went to the garage around the corner on Tenth Avenue for the Heron sedan, which Wolfe owns and I drive, and headed for Long Island, where he had been spending three days as the guest of Lewis Hewitt, who has ten thousand orchids in two 100-foot greenhouses. Driving back to Manhattan, with him in back keeping a hold on the installed-on-order strap as usual because, according to him, no automobile can be trusted for a second, I had to be careful about bumps and jerks. Not on account of Wolfe, since I had a theory that jostles were good for him, but because of the pots of orchid plants in the trunk, which were not crated, and two of them were new Laelia crosses of schroederi and ashworthiana. They were worth maybe a couple of grand, but the important point was that nobody in the world but Hewitt and now Wolfe had any. As I pulled to the curb in front of the old brownstone I blew the horn, and Theodore Horstmann came out and down, as arranged, and helped me take the pots in and up in the elevator to the plant rooms on the roof. Wolfe took his bag himself. On that I have not a theory but a rule. He needs the exercise. By the time I got down to the office he was behind his desk, in the only chair he considers satisfactory for his weight and spread, looking through the accumulated mail, and Fritz came right behind me to announce lunch. <==
At table, in the dining room across the hall, business talk was out, as always, and anyway there was no business to discuss, and I had no intention of mentioning Amy Denovo’s problem, then or ever. The talk may be of anything and everything, usually of Wolfe’s choosing, but that time I started it by remarking, as I helped myself from the silver platter, that a man had told me that shish kebab was just as good or better if it was kid instead of lamb. Wolfe said that any dish was better with kid instead of lamb, but that fresh kid, properly butchered and handled, was unattainable in the metropolitan area. Then he switched from meat to words and said it was miscalled shish kebab. It should be seekh kebab. He spelled it. That was what it was called in India, where it originated. In Hindi or Urdu a seekh is a thin iron rod with a loop at one end and a point at the other, and a kebab is a meatball. Some occidental jackass, he said, had made it shish instead of seekh, and it would serve him right if the only seekh kebab he ever got was old tough donkey instead of lamb. He was still commenting on people who garble foreign words when we finished the raspberries, stirred into a mixture, made by Fritz in a double boiler, of cream and

 sugar and egg yolks and sherry and almond extract, and went across to the office, where he got at his desk with the mail, and I got at mine with the plant records to enter the items he had talked Lewis Hewitt out of.
At four o’clock, when he took the elevator to the roof for his regular two-hour afternoon session with Theodore and the orchids, I took the stairs for the two flights to my room to do some little personal chores, like inspecting socks and changing the ribbon on my personal typewriter. Those operations always take longer than you expect, and when I heard the doorbell, which has a connection to my room, and glanced at my wrist, I was surprised to see that it was twenty to six. I left it to Fritz, who goes when I am not downstairs, but in a couple of minutes the house phone buzzed, and when I got it Fritz said that a young woman who said her name was Denovo wanted to see me, and I asked him to put her in the front room.
When, after mounting the stoop of the old brownstone, you enter, the second door down the hall on your left is the office. The first is to what we call the front room, which isn’t used much, mostly for parking people who aren’t wanted in the office. Its furniture is nothing much, not like the office or the kitchen, because Wolfe is seldom in it and doesn’t give a damn. When I entered, Amy Denovo was on a chair by a window. She stood up and said, "Well, here I am."

"So I see." I crossed to her. "It’s nice to see you and I don’t want to be rude, but I thought I made it clear yesterday."
"Oh, you made it clear enough." She started a smile but it didn’t quite come. "But I decided I had to see you again, and see Nero Wolfe, I suppose, and so I ... I did something." She had her bag, brown leather with a big clasp, under her left arm. She sat down and opened it, and took out a parcel wrapped in newspaper with rubber bands around it. She held it out and I took it, not wanting to be rude. "That’s twenty thousand dollars," she said, "in hundred-dollar bills." Now the smile came. "You would call it twenty grand. Of course you’ll want to count it."
No suitable words seemed to be ready for the tongue, so I gave them time by removing the rubber bands and unfolding the newspaper for a look. It was centuries, some new and some used, in batches fastened with paper clips, and they looked real when I flipped through some. There were ten in the batch I counted, and there were twenty batches. I rewrapped them in the newspaper and replaced the rubber bands.

"At five grand a week," she said, "that’s enough for four weeks anyway."

 sugar and egg yolks and sherry and almond extract, and went across to the office, where he got at his desk with the mail, and I got at mine with the plant records to enter the items he had talked Lewis Hewitt out of.
At four o’clock, when he took the elevator to the roof for his regular two-hour afternoon session with Theodore and the orchids, I took the stairs for the two flights to my room to do some little personal chores, like inspecting socks and changing the ribbon on my personal typewriter. Those operations always take longer than you expect, and when I heard the doorbell, which has a connection to my room, and glanced at my wrist, I was surprised to see that it was twenty to six. I left it to Fritz, who goes when I am not downstairs, but in a couple of minutes the house phone buzzed, and when I got it Fritz said that a young woman who said her name was Denovo wanted to see me, and I asked him to put her in the front room.
When, after mounting the stoop of the old brownstone, you enter, the second door down the hall on your left is the office. The first is to what we call the front room, which isn’t used much, mostly for parking people who aren’t wanted in the office. Its furniture is nothing much, not like the office or the kitchen, because Wolfe is seldom in it and doesn’t give a damn. When I entered, Amy Denovo was on a chair by a window. She stood up and said, "Well, here I am."
"So I see." I crossed to her. "It’s nice to see you and I don’t want to be rude, but I thought I made it clear yesterday."
==> "Oh, you made it clear enough." She started a smile but it didn’t quite come. "But I decided I had to see you again, and see Nero Wolfe, I suppose, and so I ... I did something." She had her bag, brown leather with a big clasp, under her left arm. She sat down and opened it, and took out a parcel wrapped in newspaper with rubber bands around it. She held it out and I took it, not wanting to be rude. "That’s twenty thousand dollars," she said, "in hundred-dollar bills." Now the smile came. "You would call it twenty grand. Of course you’ll want to count it." <==
No suitable words seemed to be ready for the tongue, so I gave them time by removing the rubber bands and unfolding the newspaper for a look. It was centuries, some new and some used, in batches fastened with paper clips, and they looked real when I flipped through some. There were ten in the batch I counted, and there were twenty batches. I rewrapped them in the newspaper and replaced the rubber bands.

"At five grand a week," she said, "that’s enough for four weeks anyway."
From the hall the sound came of the elevator rattling to a stop. Wolfe was down from the plant rooms.
"The five grand was just the fee," I said. "It didn’t include expenses. But that was a little special, it isn’t always five grand a week. Are you telling me that you want to hire Nero Wolfe and you offer this as a retainer?"

"He’s always in charge. I merely do the work."
"All right, if you do the work."
"I will. He only does the thinking. I’ll explain it to him and then call you in. If you’ll wait here?"

"No, I don’t. There’s nothing to tell except there it is."
"I can assume it’s in your possession legally?"
"Of course." She was still frowning. "I didn’t rob a bank."
"It’s still in your possession until he takes the job." I handed her the parcel. "It may take me five minutes or it could be half an hour. If you get tired waiting, there are magazines on the table." I started for the connecting door to the office but decided to go around, and went to the door to the hall instead.

==> Wolfe was at his desk with his current book, Incredible Victory, by Walter Lord. He probably hadn’t got much reading in at Hewitt’s and would have to catch up. I went to my desk, sat facing him, and waited for him to finish a paragraph. It must have been a long one. He looked up and growled. "Something?" <==
"Somebody," I said. "A girl in the front room named Amy Denovo. I believe I mentioned a while back that Miss Rowan was collecting material for a book about her father, and she hired this girl to help, and I met her there last week. As I was leaving there yesterday afternoon she - the girl - stopped me down in the lobby and we went to a place and had egg-and-anchovy sandwiches which I have told Fritz about but he wasn’t interested. She wanted me to do a job for her because I am the one man in the world she can trust, and I told her I couldn’t because I already had a job, and she said then she would hire you if I would do the work, and I explained that I always do the work. Of course the next question, my question, was about money, and I asked it. She said she had two thousand dollars in the bank, left to her by her mother, and that’s all. No other resources and no prospects. Since the job would be complicated and might take months and no telling what expenses, I told her nothing doing, I wouldn’t even mention it to you. I was sorry because - "
"Pfui." He grunted. "Why do you mention it now?"
"I’ll finish the sentence. I was sorry because the job would probably be interesting, and tough, and it has none of the aspects that you won’t touch. I mention it now because she is in the front room with a package wrapped in newspaper containing two hundred hundred-dollar-bills, twenty thousand dollars, which she wants you to take as a retainer."
"Where did she get it?"
"I don’t know. She says it’s in her possession legally."

 and toplofty." I omitted nothing except the irrelevant chatter while we were eating. When I finished he stayed put for a minute and then opened his eyes and straightened up.
He regarded me. "That’s not like you, Archie. It’s hardly even a sketch. Barely a start."
"Certainly. There was no point in going deeper with a poor little poor girl."
He looked up at the wall clock and back at me. "You could have - no matter. Very well. Bring her."
I went and opened the connecting door. She was still in the chair by the window, and hadn’t returned the parcel to her bag; it was in her lap. I told her to come.
==> Wolfe seldom rises when someone enters the office, and never if it’s a woman. His expression is always the same if it’s a woman, no matter who or what she is; he is concentrating on not making a face. There is no telling what he notices or doesn’t; for instance, whether he noticed that the skirt of Amy Denovo’s brown- striped summer dress wasn’t really a mini; it was only about two inches above her knees. Certainly he didn’t notice that the knees were worthy of notice, though they were, since that had no bearing on her acceptability as a client. The seat of the red leather chair near the end of his desk was too deep for her to settle back, so she sat on the front half, straight, and put her bag on the stand at her elbow, with the parcel in her lap. <==
Wolfe, his chair swiveled to face her, his fingers curled over the arm ends, spoke. "So Mr. Goodwin impressed you at first sight."
Her eyes, meeting his, widened a little. "Yes. He did."
"That may be a point for you and it may not. It is nothing new for him to impress a young woman. He has reported his conversation with you yesterday, to its conclusion. He says that you now have in your possession, you say legally, twenty thousand dollars in cash, and you offer it to me as retainer for the job you want me to do. Is that correct?"
"Yes, if Mr. Goodwin does the work."
"He would do his share, directed by me except when urgency forbids. The

He shook his head. "Not a parallel, Miss Denovo. Yesterday you told Mr. Goodwin that two thousand dollars in the bank was all you had, and you rejected his suggestion that you ask Miss Rowan to help you." He tapped the stack. "This is ten times two thousand. If it was a loan or a gift I would have to know from whom. If you sold something I would have to know what you sold and to whom. You may not know, at your age, that that is merely reasonable prudence. To accept a substantial retainer for a difficult and complicated operation without assurance of its legitimacy would be asinine, and if you won’t tell me where you got this money I won’t take it. If you do tell me it will have to be verified, with proper discretion, but to my satisfaction."
She was frowning again, not at him, at me, but it wasn’t really for me; it was for the problem she had been handed. But when she spoke it was to me and for me, a question: "Is he right, Mr. Goodwin? Or is he just shutting the door, as you did?"
"No," I said, "I’m afraid he’s right. As he said, just reasonable prudence. And after all, if it’s yours legally, as you told me, and if there’s nothing wrong with the way you got it, as you told him, why not spill it? It can’t be a deeper secret

 than the one we already know."
==> She looked at Wolfe and back at me. "I could tell you," she said. "Okay, tell me, and we’ll pretend he’s not here." <==
"I guess I was being silly." Her eyes were meeting mine. "After what you already know, you might as well know this too. That money came from my father. That and a lot more."
Both of my brows went up. "That makes a liar of you yesterday. Yesterday you had never had your father and didn’t know who or what he was, and the two thousand - "
"I know. That was true, I never had a father. This is what happened. When my mother died I came to New York, of course, but I had to go back for graduation, and anyway Mr. Thorne had her instructions, about cremation, and that there was to be no funeral, and he attended to all the ... the details. Then when I came to New York after the graduation he came - "
"Mr. Thorne?" "Yes. He came - " "Who is he?"
"He’s the television producer my mother worked for. He came to see me, to the apartment, and he brought things - papers and bills and letters and other things from my mother’s desk in her room at the office. And a box, a locked metal box with a label glued on it that said Property of Amy Denovo. And a key with a tag that said Key to Amy Denovo’s box. It had been - "

"No, her name was Elinor. The key had been in a locked drawer in her desk. The box had been in the office safe. It had been there for years - at least fifteen years, Mr. Thorne said. It’s about this long." She held her opened hands about sixteen inches apart. "I waited until he had gone to open it, and I was glad I did. There were just two things in it: money, hundred-dollar bills - the box was more than half full - and a sealed envelope with my name on it. I opened the envelope and it was a letter from my mother, not a long one, just one page. You want to know

 what it said."
"I sure do. Have you got it?"
"Not here, it’s at home, but I know it by heart. It’s on her personal letterhead. It isn’t dated. It says: Dear Amy, This money is from your father. I have not seen him or heard from him since four months before you were born but two weeks after you were born I received a bank check for one thousand dollars in the mail, and I have received one every month since then, and it now amounts to exactly one hundred thousand dollars. I don’t know what it will be when you read this. I didn’t ask for it and I don’t want it. I want nothing from your father. You are my daughter, and I can feed you and clothe you and give you a place to live, and I will. And see that you are properly educated. But this money came from your father, so it belongs to you, and here it is. I could put it in a bank to draw interest, but there would be taxes to pay and records of it, so I do it this way. Your mother. And below Your mother she signed her name, Elinor Denovo - only I don’t think that was her name. And it must have kept coming right up to the time she died, because it’s two hundred and sixty-four thousand dollars. Of course I can’t put it in a bank or anything like that because I would have to tell how I got it. Wouldn’t I? And I won’t."
==> I looked at Wolfe. He was looking, not at her or at me, but at the stack of lettuce on his desk. Another man could have been thinking that life certainly plays cute tricks, but he was probably reflecting that that was just one-thirteenth of what a father had paid for the privilege, or something similar. <==
I said, to him, "So it wasn’t a loan or a gift and she didn’t sell anything, but we’ll have to concede that it’s legally in her possession. Of course the Internal Revenue Service and the New York State Income Tax Bureau would like to take a whack at it, but that’s not our lookout and what they don’t know won’t hurt her. What else shall I ask her?"
He grunted and turned to her. "Is the money still in the box?"
"Yes, all but that." She gestured toward his desk. "The box is in my apartment - on Eighty-second Street. And the letter. But I don’t want ... Mr. Goodwin mentioned the Internal Revenue Service."
"We are not government agents, Miss Denovo, and are not obliged to disclose information received in confidence." He swiveled his head to look at the clock.

 whole shelves of them, were such a mixture, all kinds, fiction and nonfiction, that after I had looked at twenty or thirty titles I quit.
The one really good hint, if someone would tell me what it meant, was that there were no photographs. Except for those in Amy’s room, which belonged to her, there wasn’t a single photograph in the place, not one, of anyone or anything. That was hard to believe, but Amy said that as far as she knew there had never been any, and she had none of her mother, not even a snapshot, which was a setback, since we would certainly want to know what Elinor Denovo had looked like. I would probably have had to look long and far to find another middle-aged woman who had died, or would die, absolutely photographless.
There were papers, letters, and paid bills and miscellaneous items, including the stuff from her room at the office, but there was no diary or anything resembling one, and there was nothing that seemed likely to be of any help. If it got too tough I might have to have another go at it or put Saul Panzer on it. I did use a few of the items, in Elinor’s handwriting, to check the writing on the letter that was in the box with the money. It geed.
When I finally sat on the couch with my notebook, with Amy on one side and the box on the other, it was getting on toward noon. Amy looked two years younger; she hadn’t bunched her hair and it was dancing around when she moved her head. I got a piece of folded paper from my breast pocket.
==> "Here’s a receipt," I said, "signed by Mr. Wolfe, which he told me to give you if the box and its contents checked, and I admit they do. You are now a client in good standing." I handed it to her. "Now a suggestion. We discussed you after dinner last evening. You have been damned lucky; a closet shelf is no place for a quarter of a million dollars’ worth of skins. If you get the thought that what we’re concerned about is the fact that some of it may be needed for the job if it drags on, that’s all right, but it’s also a fact that we’re concerned with a client’s interests from every angle, not just the job. So we have a suggestion. Banks are closed today and tomorrow. When I leave I’ll take the box along and put it in the safe in our office. Monday morning I’ll take it to your bank and meet you there. Which bank is it?" <==
"The Continental. The Eighty-sixth Street branch."
"That’s fine. Mr. Wolfe’s is the Thirty-fourth Street branch and so is mine. We’ll get twelve bank checks for twenty grand each, payable to you, and I’ll have with

 me letters to twelve different savings banks in New York, ready for your signature, opening savings accounts. You’ll endorse the bank checks and we’ll enclose them in the letters. The interest will come to a thousand dollars a month, which is a nice coincidence. You’ll deposit the remaining four grand in your account at the Continental."
She was frowning. "But ... what will happen? How will I explain ...?"

She gave me a smile. "I’d like to think about it a little. I knew I could trust you. I’ll decide before you go."

"No, not here. If there had been any at the office of course Mr. Thorne would have told me."
"Okay. I should mention that I no longer think it may take a year. A week may do it, or even less. Your mother made a mistake in that letter. If she didn’t want you to find out who your father was, and obviously she didn’t, she shouldn’t have mentioned that it came in bank checks. There was and is a trail, there has to be, between those checks and the sender, and she probably cashed them at a bank, since they’re centuries. Ten centuries every month. It must have been a bank, and probably her bank. We’ll find out Monday." I opened my notebook. "Now for questions, and some of them will be very personal."
That took a full hour, and I barely made it home by lunchtime. Wolfe was standing in the doorway to the dining room when I entered. By standing there he was asking me, without putting it into words, why I hadn’t phoned that I might be late, but since I was only three minutes late I ignored it and merely asked him

By standing there he was asking me, without putting it into words, why I hadn’t phoned that I might be late, but since I was only three minutes late I ignored it and merely asked him <==

 if he wanted to take a glance inside the box before lunch. He said no, and I took it to the office and put it on his desk and then went and joined him at the table. As I sat I said it wouldn’t hurt his appetite to know that she had taken our suggestion and would meet me at her bank Monday morning, so if more than the retainer was needed it would be available.
As a rule we stay at the table for coffee at lunch, though not at dinner, but sometimes, when I have or may have something to report about a job he is committed to, he tells Fritz to bring it to the office, and my bringing the box showed that he was committed. So when we had put away the diced watermelon, which had been sprinkled with granulated sugar and refrigerated in a cup of sherry for an hour, we moved across the hall and Fritz brought coffee. I opened the box, but he merely gave it a brief glance and sat, and I went to my desk, swung my chair around, and got my notebook from a pocket.
"I was there nearly three hours," I said. "Do you want the crop?" "No." He was pouring coffee. "Only what may be useful."
"Then you should be back at your book in about ten minutes. To simplify it I’ll make it Elinor and Amy. The most interesting item is the fact that Elinor had no photographs anywhere, not even at the bottom of a drawer. Not one. That’s extremely significant, so please tell me what it signifies."

He made a noise, not enough of one to be called a grunt. "Did you get nothing at all?" He sipped coffee.
"Close to it. The trouble is, Amy doesn’t know anything. I doubt if there’s another girl anywhere who had a mother for twenty-two years and knows so little about her. One thing she knows, or thinks she does, is that her mother hated her and tried hard to hide it. She says that Amy means ‘beloved,’ and that Elinor probably wasn’t aware that she was being sarcastic when she named her that."
==> I went to the pot of coffee on Wolfe’s desk, poured a full cup, returned to my chair, and took a couple of sips. "Did Elinor have any close friends, men or women? Amy doesn’t know. Of course she has been away at college for most of the last four years. What was Elinor’s basic character? Careful, correct, and cold about covers it, according to Amy. One of the words she used was ‘introvert,’ which I would have supposed was moth-eaten for a girl just out of Smith." <==

nipped a page of my notebook. "Elinor must have dropped some hints without thinking, at least one little one in twenty years, about her background, her childhood, but Amy says no. She doesn’t know what Elinor did for a living before she went to work for Raymond Thorne Productions, the firm she was with when she died. She doesn’t even know what Elinor did, specifically, at Thorne’s; she only knows it must have been an important job."
I nipped another page and took some coffee. "Believe it or not, Amy doesn’t know where she was born. She thinks it might have been Mount Sinai Hospital, because that’s where Elinor went for an appendectomy about ten years ago, but that’s just a guess. Anyway it probably wouldn’t help much, since Elinor certainly wasn’t letting things she didn’t want known get into the record. Amy does know one thing, and of course it’s essential, the date. She was born April twelfth, nineteen forty-five. About five years ago she decided to see the doctor who signed her birth certificate but found he was dead. So she was conceived around the middle of July nineteen forty-four, so that’s the time to place Elinor, but Amy doesn’t know where she was living. The first home Amy remembers was a walkup, two flights, on West Ninety-second Street, when she was three. When she was seven they moved to a better one on West Seventy-eighth Street, and when she was thirteen they jumped the park to the East Side, to the one I inspected this morning."
I emptied my cup and decided it was enough. "I’ll skip the details of the inspection unless you insist. As I said, no photographs, which is fantastic. The letters and other papers, a washout. If we fed them to a computer I would expect it to come up with something like SO WHAT or TELL IT TO THE MARINES. It would have been a pleasure to find for instance a newspaper clipping about a man, no matter what it said, but nothing doing. Did I mention that Amy has no photograph of her mother? We’ll have to snare one somehow." I shut the notebook and tossed it on the desk. "Questions?"
He said, "Grrrhh."

By the time the Gazette went to press on Thursday, June first, the date of the last clipping, the police had got nowhere. They didn’t even claim that anyone had been invited in for questioning, let alone name a suspect; they only said that the investigation was being vigorously pursued, which was probably true, since they hate a hit-and-run and don’t quit until it’s absolutely hopeless, and even then they don’t forget it.
There was nothing about Elinor Denovo that I didn’t already know, except that she was vice-president of Raymond Thorne Productions, Inc. Miss Amy Denovo had been interviewed but hadn’t said much. Raymond Thorne had said that Mrs. Denovo had made valuable contributions to the art of television production and her death was a great loss not only for his company but for the whole television industry and therefore for the country. I thought he should make up his mind whether television was an art or an industry.
I put the file on Lon’s desk, waited until he had finished at a phone, and said, "Many thanks. I was curious about a detail. The latest item is June first. Would

 you know if there has been any progress since?"
==> He got at a phone, the green one this time, pressed a button, and in a moment talked, and then waited. While he waited another phone buzzed, and stopped when he pushed a button. In a couple of minutes he told the green phone, "Yeah, sure." In another couple of minutes he cradled it, turned to me and said, "Apparently it’s dead. Our last word, more than a month ago, was that we might as well cross it off. They had only one man still on it. But now of course, with Nero Wolfe horning in, it’s far from dead. So it was murder. I don’t expect you to name him, even off the record, but I want enough for a page one box." <==
I was on my feet. "Journalists," I said, "are the salt and pepper of the earth. I would enjoy discussing that with you, but I’m on my way to a rustic swimming pool in the middle of a tailor-made glade in the Westchester woods, and I’m twenty hours late. I said it was something trivial, but have it your way. Yes, it was murder, and the driver of the car was the skunk who topped my three aces with four deuces Thursday night. I hope they get him."
I turned and went.
But down in the lobby I went to a phone booth, dialed a number I didn’t have to look up, gave my name, asked if Sergeant Stebbins was around, and after a long wait got his voice:
"Stebbins. Something up, Archie?"
He must have just won a bet or got a raise. He called me Archie only about once in two years, and sometimes he wouldn’t even say Goodwin but made it just you. I returned the compliment. "Nothing with a bite, Purley, just a routine question, but to answer it you may have to look at a file. You may have forgotten it, it was nearly three months ago - a hit-and-run on East Eighty-third Street, a woman named Elinor Denovo - "

"We haven’t forgotten it. We don’t forget a hit-and-run."
"I know you don’t, I was just being impolite for practice. Someone asked me if you’ve dug up a lead on it, and of course I didn’t know. Have you?"
"Who asked you?"

==> Oh, Mr. Wolfe and I were discussing crime and whether cops are as good as they ought to be, and he mentioned this Elinor Denovo. As you know, he misses nothing in the papers. I said you would probably get that one, and I was curious. Of course I’m not asking for any inside dope ..." <==
"There isn’t any dope, inside or outside. It’s hanging. But we’re not forgetting it."
"Right. I hope you get him. Nobody likes a hit-and-run."
Walking to Forty-third Street for the car, I had to concede that I had got no relief at all for the itch.

YOU WOULD SUPPOSE THAT at ten minutes to ten Monday morning, as I sat in a taxicab headed uptown, with the box on the seat beside me and the breast pocket of my jacket bulging with envelopes containing letters to twelve savings banks because I never lug a brief case if I can help it, my mind would be on the morning’s program, but it wasn’t. It was on the hour just past, or part of it, instead of the one just ahead. I don’t like to have people bellow at me, particularly not Wolfe.

Also I had had only six hours’ sleep, a full two hours less than I need and nearly always get. Getting home after midnight Sunday, I had decided against typing twelve letters before turning in, and so had to set the alarm for seven o’clock. When it went off I opened one eye to glare at it, but I knew I would have to hustle, much as I hate hustling before breakfast, and in six minutes, maybe seven, I was on my feet. At 7:45 I was at the little table in the kitchen where I eat breakfast, on the last swallow of orange juice, and Fritz was crossing to me with the grilled ham and corn fritters, and at 8:10 I was in the office at the typewriter. At 9:15 I had finished the twelfth letter and had started folding and putting them in envelopes when the doorbell rang, and I went to the hall for a look through the one-way glass in the front door, and saw a big burly male with a big round red face topped by a big battered broad-brimmed felt hat. The hat alone would have been enough. Inspector Cramer of Homicide South must be the only man in New York who wears such a hat on a hot sunny day in August.
Nuts, I thought, let him ring. But it must be just for me, since he knew Wolfe was never available before eleven o’clock, so I went and opened the door and

 said, "Good morning and greetings, but I’m busy and I’m in a rush. I really mean it."
"So am I." It was gruff, but it always is. "I’m just stopping by on my way down. Why did you call Stebbins on that hit-and-run?"

He opened his mouth, clamped it shut, about-faced, and started down the seven steps of the stoop. His PD car was there, double-parked. By the time he reached it I was back in the office.
Time was short, but it was quite possible that Cramer would phone while I was gone, and Wolfe didn’t know about my call to Purley Stebbins. He is not to be disturbed short of an emergency when he is up in the plant rooms, but he had to be told, so I took the house phone and pushed a button, and after a wait his voice came.
"Yes?"
"Me in a hurry. Cramer was here just now, stopping on his way downtown. I

At the Eighty-sixth Street branch I found that Hotchkiss had been prompt. I was only six steps inside when a man at a desk got up and motioned me over and asked if I was Mr. Goodwin, and then took me inside the rail and along an aisle to a door at the front. He opened it and bowed me in, and there was Amy Denovo on a chair facing a big glass-topped desk. Behind the desk was a middle-aged banker with a shiny dome and rimless cheaters. As I crossed he rose and offered a hand, saying that it was a pleasure, Mr. Goodwin, a real pleasure, which was par, since Hotchkiss was a vice-president and he wasn’t. I said, "Mr. Atwood?" and he said yes and told me to sit, but after telling Amy good morning I put the box on the desk, fished the key from my pocket and used it, and opened the lid wide. Then I sat Atwood had started to, but was up again, staring at the contents of the box. It rated a stare, even from a banker.
"That belongs to Miss Denovo," I said. "I assume that Mr. Hotchkiss told you that I work for Nero Wolfe. Miss Denovo has engaged Mr. Wolfe’s services, and I’m here for her. That’s two hundred and forty-four thousand dollars, all in centuries. Miss Denovo would like to have twelve bank checks for twenty grand each, payable to her, and the remaining four grand deposited in her account."
"Certainly," he said. He looked at her and back at me. "That’s quite a ... quite a ... certainly. Do you want ... it will take a while, a little while - counting it and making out the checks."
I nodded. "Sure. Certainly. Anyway, if you’re not too busy, we’d like to discuss something with you."
"Cer - I’ll be glad to, Mr. Goodwin." His hand started for the phone on the desk, but he changed his mind. He closed the lid of the box, tucked it under his arm, said he would be back soon, and went.

When the door was shut Amy asked, "What’s he going to do?"
"His duty," I said. "The slogan of this bank is: THE BANK YOU CAN BANK ON. You have crossed and uncrossed your ankles three times. Relax."

When I got back to the table Amy had started her third cup of coffee. As I sat she said, "I’ve been thinking. You’re wonderful, Mr. Goodwin. Simply

 wonderful. I wish ... I want to call you Archie."
"Try it and see what happens. I might like it. Since you say your mother was being sarcastic when she tagged you Amy I suppose you wish your name was Araminta or Hephzibah, or you pick it."
"I could pick a better one."
==> "I’ll bet you could. Now we have a problem. I have to ask people questions about your mother, a few of those whose names you gave me yesterday, and I am to start with Raymond Thorne. You’ll phone him and tell him you’re sending me and you hope he’ll cooperate, but I can’t just say I’m after men your mother knew in the summer of nineteen forty-four - that’s when the genes met - since you don’t want anyone to know or even suspect that it’s a father hunt. So I have a suggestion, approved by Mr. Wolfe, which we expect you to approve." <==
"Oh, I’ll approve anything you - " She stopped and tightened her lips. Then she smiled. "Listen to me. You might think I had no brains at all. Tell me and we’ll see." I told her.

THE OFFICE OF Raymond Thorne Productions was on the sixth floor of one of the newer steel-and-glass hives on Madison Avenue in the Forties. Judging from its size, and the furniture and fixtures, and the cordial smile of the receptionist, the television art, or maybe industry, was doing fine. Also I had to wait twenty minutes to get in to Thorne, though he had told Amy on the phone that his door would always be open for her or anyone she sent.
Of course I wasn’t suspecting that he might himself be the target. In her letter Elinor had told Amy that she hadn’t seen or heard from her father since four months before she was born, and there was no reason to suppose that that might be flam and she had seen him every work day for twenty years. The idea that a detective should suspect everything that everybody says is a good general rule, but there’s a limit.
Thorne and his room went together fine. The room was big and modern and so was he. After giving me a man-to-man handshake and saying how much he would like to help Amy any way he could, and telling me to sit, he returned to

THE OFFICE OF Raymond Thorne Productions was on the sixth floor of one of the newer steel-and-glass hives on Madison Avenue in the Forties. Judging from its size, and the furniture and fixtures, and the cordial smile of the receptionist, the television art, or maybe industry, was doing fine. Also I had to wait twenty minutes to get in to Thorne, though he had told Amy on the phone that his door would always be open for her or anyone she sent.

Thorne and his room went together fine. The room was big and modern and so was he. After giving me a man-to-man handshake and saying how much he would like to help Amy any way he could, and telling me to sit, he returned to

 his desk and said he didn’t know what it was I wanted because Amy had been rather vague on the phone.
==> I nodded. "She thought I could tell it better, but it’s really very simple. She wants Nero Wolfe - you may have heard the name." <==
"Oh, sure."
"She wants him to find out who killed her mother. I think she’s a little hipped on it, but that’s her privilege. She thinks the cops should have nailed him long ago, and also she thinks they went at it wrong. She thinks it was premeditated murder. In fact, she’s sure it was. Don’t ask me why she’s sure; I have asked her, and she says it’s intuition. How old were you when you learned not to argue with intuition?"
"It’s so long ago I’ve forgotten."
"Me too. But intuition hasn’t told her who it was. She has made a list of names, twenty-eight of them, people who were friends of her mother, everybody who had personal contact that could be called close even by stretching it, and she has said no to all of them. She says none of them could possibly have had a reason, so it must have been someone she doesn’t know about - someone connected with her work here, or someone from many years ago when she was too young to remember. Therefore I come to you first, naturally. She worked here, and you knew her - how long?"
"More than twenty years." He had his head cocked. "Do you think it was premeditated murder?"

==> "Mr. Wolfe would say it’s ‘cogitable.’ He likes words like that. It could have been; none of the facts say no. If we find someone with a healthy motive that will make it interesting. The first thing I would like from you is a photograph of Mrs. Denovo. You must have some." <==
His eyes left me for a quick glance down and to the right, then up again. "I don’t think ..." He let that go. "Didn’t you get one from Amy?"
"She hasn’t any. There aren’t any in the apartment. Surely you have some. At least one."
"Well ..." He glanced down again. "I’m not surprised that there are none in the

 apartment. Mrs. Denovo had a thing about photographs - I mean of her. When we wanted pictures of the staff, for promotion, we had to leave her out. She couldn’t be persuaded. Once we got up a folder with separate pictures of seven of us, but not of her, though she should have been up front, after me. No picture of her at all, period." He rubbed his chin with fingertips, eying me. "But I’ve got one."

"Yes, I am."
"After being closely associated with her for twenty-two years? I don’t believe it."
He nodded. "You’re not the first detective that can’t believe it. Two of them from the police, at different times, couldn’t either. But it’s - "
"Were they here recently?"
"No, that was back in May, just after her death. But it’s true. She never spoke of her family or background - anything you could call personal, and she wasn’t a woman you would ... Well, she kept her distance. I’ll give you an example. Once a woman - an important woman, important to us; she represented one of our clients - she was saying something about her sister, and she asked Mrs. Denovo if she had a sister, and she just ignored it. Not even a yes or no. I’m pretty quick at getting on to people, and within a month after I met her, less than that, I knew she had lines I wasn’t to cross. And I never did. If you want to ask some of the others here go ahead, but you’ll be wasting your time. Do you want to try?"
==> Ordinarily I would have said yes, and perhaps I should have, but I was only partly there. I had come only because Wolfe had said to. Where I wanted to be was with Avery Ballou. So I said I didn’t want to interfere with their lunch hours but I might be back later, tomorrow if not today, and thanked him on behalf of Miss Denovo. He said if I come tomorrow he would have the copies of the <==

 photographs by four o’clock, and I thanked him again.
As I went down the hall to the elevator I decided to head for Al’s diner and treat myself to bacon and eggs and home-fried potatoes. Eggs are never fried in Wolfe’s and Fritz’s kitchen, and neither are potatoes, but that wasn’t the main point. The idea of sitting through lunch with Wolfe and discussing something like the future of computers or the effect of organized sport on American culture, when we should be discussing how to handle Avery Ballou, didn’t appeal to me.
But knowing that Wolfe had done his reflecting and was as keen to go at Ballou as I was, I reflected as I sipped coffee and decided it would do him good to be stalled off a little, say half an hour, to even up for my being stalled by his sappy rule about table talk. So I watched the time. I left the diner at two on the dot, walked the three blocks to the old brownstone, and entered the office at 2:05, got the retainer from the safe, went across the hall to the dining-room door, and said, "You said to deposit this at an early opportunity and this is it. I’ll be back in half an hour."
"No." He put his coffee cup down. "That can wait. We have a decision to make." "Sorry," I said, "I like to obey orders," and went.

I admit I didn’t loiter walking to Lexington Avenue and back, but even so I was gone thirty-six minutes. The television was on and he was standing in the middle of the room glaring at it. Presumably he had been so riled that he had picked on the one thing there that would rile him more. As I put the bankbook in the safe he turned the television off and went to his desk, and as I went to mine he demanded, "What the devil has someone done?"
Not "What have you done?"

y not offer him nine in the evening too?"
"As you know, I don’t like to work after dinner. But I suppose... Very well. Add it."
I pulled the typewriter around and got out paper and carbon.
An hour later, as I headed north on the Henry Hudson Parkway, keeping to sixty, I wasn’t on a perch either professionally or personally. Professionally, the client was being neglected. I had phoned her Friday morning that it was very unlikely that Jarrett was her father, and told her why, and that was all. She deserved to know that she had been right about Denovo, that her mother’s real name was Carlotta Vaughn; at least we could give her that for the eight days we had been on it. Personally, there I was bound for a swimming pool in a glade while Orrie was in Washington digging into army records and Saul and Fred were poking into holes that were probably empty. I should have been doing something brilliant, like finding a mattress somewhere with hairs from two human heads on it which a scientist would prove had been left there by Carlotta Vaughn, alias Elinor Denovo, and Eugene Jarrett.
==> I wasn’t feeling any better as I drove back to town Sunday evening. The weekend had been messy. There is never more than one house guest besides me; it may be anybody from a female poet to a cowboy from the Montana ranch Lily owns; and that time it was Amy Denovo. She gave it a good start only an hour after I arrived. She called me Archie. We were on the terrace. I had finished off the steak Mimi had broiled - they had eaten - and was forking the blueberry pie when Amy got out a cigarette and I lit it, and she said, "Thank you, Archie." Of course Lily didn’t bat an eye; she wouldn’t. But as far as she knew Amy had seen me only three times for a total of about nine minutes, and she didn’t have to be a cluster of vagaries to wonder what the score was. Was Amy just being flip, or had I decided to see more of her, not at the penthouse, and taken steps? I couldn’t tell her what Miss Denovo had hired Wolfe to do, so I skipped it. But it was there in the air. Between Lily and me it was thoroughly understood that what I did was none of her business unless it touched her - and, naturally, vice versa - but the fact that I had met Miss Denovo at the penthouse put it on the borderline. So it didn’t help the weekend. <==
A couple of other things didn’t help either. One of the five guests for lunch Saturday was a woman with a green wig who had positive inside information

 that President Johnson and Dean Rusk had decided three years ago to kill everybody in China with hydrogen bombs, and that was the real reason for what they were doing in Vietnam.
Of course the only thing to do with such a clunk is to ignore him or her, but she kept it up so loud and long that I finally told her that I had positive inside information that Senator Fulbright had once had an affair with one of Ho Chi Minh’s concubines, and that was the real reason he wanted the bombing stopped. That was a mistake. The idea appealed to her and she wanted all the details.
And Sunday afternoon some uninvited people dropped in - a couple I had met there before who had a place over beyond Bedford Village. They weren’t so bad, but they had a guy with them who they said had talked them into coming because he wanted to meet me. His name was Floyd Vance and he said he was a public-relations counselor. Evidently he wanted to meet me because he wanted to meet Nero Wolfe. He was drumming up trade. He said that if anybody needed expert handling of his public image a private detective did, and he would like very much to create a presentation to propose to Nero Wolfe. He also said that if we were working on a case and I would tell him about it, he could use that as a basis for the presentation. When he said that I sharpened my eyes and ears a little, and my tongue, thinking he might be making a stab at detective work himself for somebody, for instance Cyrus M. Jarrett, but decided he was just another character who was so dedicated to improving other people’s images that he had no time left for his own. I met one once who - no, that’s enough for that weekend.

Of course, of the three people who had made that weekend less than perfect Amy was the only one whose contribution would carry over. Lily would do some wondering for a week or so - who wouldn’t? - but I certainly wasn’t going to explain. When two people who want to get along start needing to have things explained, look out. I would tell the client about her mother’s real name when I felt like it.

One was from a man who said Carlotta Vaughn was his grandmother, and maybe a Carlotta Vaughn was, but he didn’t mention Elinor Denovo.

"Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie Goodwin speaking."
Female voice: "Good morning. Mr. Jarrett would like to speak to Mr. Wolfe." "Good morning. Please put Mr. Jarrett on."
"Is Mr. Wolfe there?"
"Yes."
"Please put him on."
==> "Now listen." I motioned to Wolfe. "Last Friday I got Mr. McCray for Mr. Wolfe and I was forced to put Mr. Wolfe on first You can’t have it coming and going. Put Mr. Jarrett on or I hang up." <==
"May I have your name, please?"
"Archie Goodwin."
"Please hold the wire, Mr. Goodwin."
I timed it: two minutes and twenty seconds. Wolfe bad his phone. "Eugene Jarrett speaking. Nero Wolfe?"
Me: "Please hold the wire, Mr. Jarrett."

Wolfe should have waited at least a minute, but he hates the phone, either

 holding or talking. "This is Nero Wolfe. Yes, Mr. Jarrett?"
"I have your letter. I’ll come around six."

"Good. As I said in the letter, I’ll appreciate it. I’ll expect you."
They hung up together. There was a case where the approach took five minutes and the meet about ten seconds. A piece by a scientist in the Sunday New York Times Magazine which I had read during the weekend had explained why this is the age of instant communication.

There were some items in the morning mail that needed attention, or at least got it, but we were interrupted a few times by phone calls: from Saul, who had drawn nothing but blanks; from Fred, who had found three people who had recognized the photographs but hadn’t been any help; and from Orrie, from Washington, who had verified most of Jarrett’s places and dates and was working on the rest. The hospital part, which covered most of July, was airtight. You are probably thinking that the client was getting damned little for her money, and I agree. When I returned from a trip to the mailbox at the corner it was lunchtime, and as we crossed to the dining room Wolfe said something about Mr. Cramer and I asked if he had phoned. Wolfe said no, he had come, late Saturday afternoon.
I was sorry I had missed it because talk by those two is always worth hearing. You get good examples of how much a man can say in a few words and also of how little he can say in a lot of words. So back in the office after lunch I said I would just as soon know what Cramer had wanted, and Wolfe said only what he always wanted, information; he had said nothing that would help us any.

I settled back and crossed my legs. "I haven’t kept count," I said, "but at least a thousand times I have given you a verbatim report of a conversation. I can’t tell you to because I don’t pay you, you pay me, but I can suggest it. I am suggesting it."
A corner of his mouth went up a sixteenth of an inch. For him it was a broad smile. "My memory is as good as yours, Archie."
"Then it would be no strain. I said verbatim."
"I know you did." He squinted at me. "Well ... Mr. Cramer, admitted by Fritz,

"Cramer: ‘Yeah. I doubt if there’s a man on earth as good at fielding questions as you are. So I’ll ask another one. Saturday the nineteenth, a week ago, Goodwin rang Sergeant Stebbins and asked him about a hit-and-run three months ago that killed a woman named Elinor Denovo. Some crap about you and him discussing crime. Last Monday morning, I came and asked Goodwin why he had called Stebbins. He said he knew nothing about that hit-and-run except what he had read in the papers, and neither did you, and you hadn’t been consulted about it, and your only client was a girl who wanted to find her father. I want the name of that girl. I wish Goodwin was here. Where is he?’
"Wolfe: Absent. Mr. Cramer. You may query me in that tone only when your questions are justified by your official function.’

Wolfe waved a hand toward the hall, waving Cramer out. "Next time I’ll turn the recorder on. Questions."
I uncrossed my legs and straightened up. "No questions, just two comments. First, I think you left out a word or two, particularly one that he often uses. That’s censorship, which you condemn. Second, there’s something about that hit-and-run that makes it special, and it would be nice to know what it is.

I spent most of the next three hours finding out next to nothing about Eugene Jarrett. He wasn’t in Who’s Who, and since there was no other likely source of information about him in the office I went for a walk, keeping on the shady side of the street.

nly two worth an entry in my notebook were that he had married a girl named Adele Baldwin on November 18, 1951, and he had become a vice- president of Seaboard Bank and Trust Company in December 1959. Lon Cohen knew absolutely nothing about him, and neither did a couple of others on the Gazette that he got on the phone. On the way out I stopped at the sixteenth floor to see if there were any more replies to the ad and got two that were more of the same.

==> At the Times there was another reply, also impossible, and nothing in the morgue about Eugene Jarrett except such routine facts as that he graduated from Harvard in 1945 and he had been a sponsor of a dinner to honor somebody in 1963. The biggest blank was the New York public library, where I got stubborn and spent a full hour. You wouldn’t believe that after all that expert research I didn’t even know whether that vice-president of the third largest bank in New York had any children or not, when I returned to the old brownstone a little before six o’clock. But I didn’t. I had supposed, when I left, that I would have to get back in time to go up to the plant rooms to brief Wolfe on him before he came, but it wasn’t even worth buzzing him on the house phone. When he came down I told him that we would learn more about Eugene Jarrett in one glance at him than I had learned all afternoon, and the doorbell rang. <==
I was right, too. What I learned looking at him, as I let him in and escorted him to the office and got him seated in the red leather chair, may have been irrelevant and immaterial, but at least it was definite. If a vice-president of a big bank is supposed to do any work, he didn’t belong there. There was no resemblance to his father at all, especially the eyes. His were gray-blue too, but even when they were aimed straight at you, you had the feeling that they were seeing something else, maybe a ship he wanted to be on or a pretty girl sitting on a cloud. I don’t often have fancy ideas, so that shows you the effect those eyes had. It would be dumb to expect a man like that to do any work. The rest of him was normal enough - about my height, square-shouldered, an ordinary face. Seated, he ignored Wolfe and me while his eyes took their time to go around the room. Apparently they liked the rug, but they stayed longest on the globe over by the bookshelves. Not many people coming there have seen a globe as big as that one, 351⁄2 inches in diameter.
He finally turned the eyes on Wolfe and said, "A fascinating occupation, yours, Mr. Wolfe. People come to you for answers as they did to the Pythia at Delphi or the Clarian prophet. But of course you make no claim to mantic divination. That is now only for charlatans. What are you, a scientist, or an artist?"


Wolfe was frowning at him. "If you please, Mr. Jarrett, no labels. Labels are for the things men make, not for men. The most primitive man is too complex to be labeled. Do you have one?"

Wolfe was frowning at him. "If you please, Mr. Jarrett, no labels. Labels are for the things men make, not for men. The most primitive man is too complex to be labeled. Do you have one?"
"No. But I can label any man whose faculties are concentrated on a single purpose. I can label Charles de Gaulle or Robert Welch or Stokely Carmichael."

I spent most of the next three hours finding out next to nothing about Eugene Jarrett. He wasn’t in Who’s Who, and since there was no other likely source of information about him in the office I went for a walk, keeping on the shady side of the street. There were just four items about him in the Gazette morgue, and

nly two worth an entry in my notebook were that he had married a girl named Adele Baldwin on November 18, 1951, and he had become a vice- president of Seaboard Bank and Trust Company in December 1959. Lon Cohen knew absolutely nothing about him, and neither did a couple of others on the Gazette that he got on the phone. On the way out I stopped at the sixteenth floor to see if there were any more replies to the ad and got two that were more of the same.
At the Times there was another reply, also impossible, and nothing in the morgue about Eugene Jarrett except such routine facts as that he graduated from Harvard in 1945 and he had been a sponsor of a dinner to honor somebody in 1963. The biggest blank was the New York public library, where I got stubborn and spent a full hour. You wouldn’t believe that after all that expert research I didn’t even know whether that vice-president of the third largest bank in New York had any children or not, when I returned to the old brownstone a little before six o’clock. But I didn’t. I had supposed, when I left, that I would have to get back in time to go up to the plant rooms to brief Wolfe on him before he came, but it wasn’t even worth buzzing him on the house phone. When he came down I told him that we would learn more about Eugene Jarrett in one glance at him than I had learned all afternoon, and the doorbell rang.
I was right, too. What I learned looking at him, as I let him in and escorted him to the office and got him seated in the red leather chair, may have been irrelevant and immaterial, but at least it was definite. If a vice-president of a big bank is supposed to do any work, he didn’t belong there. There was no resemblance to his father at all, especially the eyes. His were gray-blue too, but even when they were aimed straight at you, you had the feeling that they were seeing something else, maybe a ship he wanted to be on or a pretty girl sitting on a cloud. I don’t often have fancy ideas, so that shows you the effect those eyes had. It would be dumb to expect a man like that to do any work. The rest of him was normal enough - about my height, square-shouldered, an ordinary face. Seated, he ignored Wolfe and me while his eyes took their time to go around the room. Apparently they liked the rug, but they stayed longest on the globe over by the bookshelves. Not many people coming there have seen a globe as big as that one, 351⁄2 inches in diameter.

"No. But I can label any man whose faculties are concentrated on a single purpose. I can label Charles de Gaulle or Robert Welch or Stokely Carmichael."
"If you do, don’t glue them on, and have replacements handy."
Jarrett nodded. "Nothing is unalterable, not even a label. I have altered mine for my father several times. I mention him because it is apropos. The only reference to him in your letter was that Carlotta Vaughn was in his employ, but Bert McCray has told me about your poke at him and how he met it. He has also told me of your intention to transfer the poke to me. I would enjoy discussing my father with you - we might get a better label for him than the one I have - but your letter asks about Carlotta Vaughn. First we should dispose of me. You thought my father was the father of a child she bore, were confronted with evidence that he wasn’t, and decided that I was. Is that correct?"
"Not ‘decided.’ Conjectured or surmised - or even inferred."
"No matter. You’re in for another disappointment. When Bert McCray told me about it Saturday, and then when your letter came, I decided to save you time and expense - and of course avoid annoyance for myself - by telling you something that many people conjecture or surmise but only a few really know. But I realized that my telling you wouldn’t settle it for you, so this morning I phoned my doctor."

He turned to me. "You’re Archie Goodwin?"
I told him yes. He got a leather case from his pocket, fingered a card out, and extended his hand, and I went and took the card. The "James Odell Worthington, M.D." might actually have been engraved.
"Dr. Worthington will see you at nine tomorrow morning," Jarrett said. "Be on time; he’s a very busy man. He will tell you that I am incapable of impregnating a woman and always have been. He has a reputation and would on no account risk it by telling you that if there was any remote possibility that you would ever prove him wrong."


==> He turned to Wolfe. "Your letter said that you want information about Carlotta Vaughn." <==
I would have told him to go climb a tree. Wolfe probably would have liked to, but the only visible sign was the tip of his forefinger making a little circle on the desk blotter. He asked, "Did Dr. Worthington know you in nineteen forty-four?"
"Yes, he was one of the doctors who had tried to save my mother. He’s an internist and the cancer specialists had taken charge, but my mother depended on him. Don’t ask me, ask him. " He brushed it aside. "Ask me anything you want to about Carlotta Vaughn, but I doubt if I know anything that will help. She changed her name to Elinor Denovo, and she had a daughter now twenty-two years old, and during those twenty-two years my father sent her a check for a thousand dollars every month. Is that the situation?"
"Yes."
"Then I need a new label for him. This is fantastic. It doesn’t fit anything I thought I knew about him. Not that he would ignore a responsibility; he fulfills any and all responsibilities; but he decides when he is responsible and when he isn’t. He certainly wouldn’t have felt responsible if I had impregnated Carlotta Vaughn or any other woman, or a dozen. Bert McCray thinks it was blackmail, but it wasn’t. It’s inconceivable that he has ever, submitted to blackmail by anybody for anything. It’s fascinating. I understand from Avery Ballou that this Elinor Denovo is dead, but didn’t she ever tell anyone what the money was for?"
"While alive, no. But a letter opened by her daughter after her death said this money is from your father. And again, this money came from your father. Mr. Goodwin and I see no reason to question it."

"Fantastic. Unbelievable." Jarrett narrowed his eyes to slits, put his elbows on the chair arms, and rubbed his left palm with his right. Then he came up and was on his feet. "I’m no good sitting down." He moved, across to the bookshelves and looked at titles, then to the globe and rotated it, slowly, twice around.

He went to the red leather chair and sat. "It would be pointless to ask me anything about Carlotta Vaughn. Bert McCray told me that her child was conceived in the summer of nineteen forty-four. I had been rejected by the army and spent that summer working in a war-materials plant in California. I know nothing that could possibly help you." He got up again. "Come and have dinner with me." He looked at me. "You too. Sometimes it helps to have people around, I don’t know why."
"I doubt," Wolfe said, "if it would help to have Mr. Goodwin and me around. We’re in a pickle. I wrote you that I would appreciate it if you would call at my office. I retract that. I don’t appreciate it at all."
"I suppose not." He turned and sort of wandered toward the hall, but stopped and swung around. "The pickle you’re in is nothing to mine. I thought I had my father plain and clear, and now this! I’m going to see it - I don’t know when, but I will. I have to."

After ten seconds of that he raised his head to growl at me. "Sit down. Confound it, you know I like eyes at a level."
"Yeah. Shall I get the darts out?"
"No. How much have we spent?"
That was dangerous. That question meant, If I return the retainer and drop it, how much am I out? That hadn’t happened often, but it wasn’t unthinkable. I went to my chair and sat. "I admit," I said, "that we’ve never had a tougher one, and it may be too tough even for you, but why can’t we just hang on until Eugene sees it?

"Then we’re left with nothing."
"We have Saul and Fred and Orrie. And me. And, oh, yes, excuse me, we have you."
He looked at his current book, always there on the desk, picked it up, dropped it, and glared at me.

==> SIXTY-EIGHT HOURS LATER, at three o’clock Thursday afternoon, Wolfe and I sat in the office with nothing more to say. We still had exactly what we had had Monday at dinnertime, five detectives, counting us. <==
First, to finish off Eugene Jarrett. At 8:50 Tuesday morning I had got off the elevator at the tenth floor of a building on Park Avenue in the Eighties, given my name to a woman at a desk, and been sent to a big old-fashioned room with twenty chairs distributed around the walls and tables, eight or nine of them occupied by people who didn’t look very gay, which wasn’t too discouraging because the names of four M.D.s had been on the plaque. At 9:20 another woman had come and ushered me down a hall to a door which she opened. When I entered, a gray-haired man with shaggy black eyebrows and a tired wide mouth, at a desk, writing on a pad, nodded and pointed to a chair, went on writing for a couple of minutes, and then put the pen down and turned to me. He asked if my name was Archie Goodwin and I said yes, and he said that since the information he was to give me was confidential he would like to be sure...
I got my wallet out and showed him things, and he nodded and looked at his wristwatch. "We squeezed you in," he said, "because Mr. Jarrett said it was urgent. He asked me to confirm his statement to you that he is sterile and has been sterile all his adult life. Very well, I do. That is true."
"If you don’t mind," I said, "we want it airtight. That’s of your personal knowledge? Not hearsay?"
"I wouldn’t make such a statement from hearsay. My professional knowledge, yes. Four examinations and analyses, at intervals, in seventeen years. Not only is the sperm count per se too low, but also the percentage of abnormal forms is too high. It is conclusive."
"Thank you. Seventeen years ago was nineteen fifty. What about earlier? Say nineteen forty-four."

The third reply that seemed possible, which I got at the Gazette, was from a man named Salvatore Manzoni. I took him. He had been a waiter at Sardi’s for fifteen years and still was. In 1944 he had been a waiter at Tufitti’s, a restaurant on East Forty-sixth Street which had folded in 1949, and Carlotta Vaughn had dined at one of his tables two or three times a week for several months in 1944, He spotted her picture instantly, and he knew her name was Carlotta Vaughn because she had often reserved a table. What made Salvatore Manzoni a real find was that he had probably actually seen Amy’s father hi the flesh, not once but many times, for Carlotta Vaughn bad always had a male companion, and always the same one. When I heard that, I had a tingle at the bottom of my spine; by God, I was going to get the name, then and there. But I didn’t. It wasn’t that Salvatore Manzoni couldn’t remember it; he had never known it. As far as he knew, a reservation had never been made under the man’s name. Possibly it might have been known to someone else at the restaurant, perhaps the owner and manager, Giuseppe Tufitti, who might or might not be still alive.
A description by anyone of a man he saw last week will never make you really see him, and 1944 was twenty-three years ago, and this subject had been mostly sitting at a table when he was under Salvatore Manzoni’s eyes, which makes a difference. What I got was: age, early thirties. Height, around six feet. Weight, around a hundred and seventy. Shoulders, maybe square, maybe rounded a little. Head, a little bigger than average. Face, not round, maybe rattier long; not pale, maybe a little tanned. Hair, dark brown. Eyes, brown (just a guess). Nose and mouth and ears and chin, yes, he had them.
If that really shows him to you, you have better sight than I have. It did exclude the Jarretts and Bertram McCray, but they were already out. I wish I knew if you would really be interested in what we did during the next forty-eight hours. I doubt it, because it was all negative. Wednesday morning Saul and Fred had been put on it too, and also Orrie when he returned from Washington. If we could name and place Carlotta Vaughn’s dinner partner for those months of 1944 it was 20 to 1 that we would have Amy’s father, which was the job, and we gave

 it all we had. Detecting can be fun, but it can be a pain not only in the neck but also in the head, the guts, the back, the legs, the feet, and the ass. And often is. It was that time.
==> So at three o’clock Thursday afternoon Wolfe and I sat in the office with nothing more to say. Saul and Fred and Orrie were still out pecking at it, but when they called in_ we wouldn’t be disappointed because we were expecting nothing. Wolfe had started his second bottle of beer since lunch, which exceeded his quota, and I had just returned from the kitchen with a slug of Irish, which made me a lush trying to drown it. I looked at Wolfe, who had his eyes closed and his jaw clamped, and said, "If you’re trying to figure how much you’re out, it’s three grand plus, not counting me." <==
He shook his head but didn’t open his eyes. "I am making assumptions. I am assuming that Miss Denovo’s father murdered her mother; that it is more feasible to find him as a murderer than as a father, since he became a father twenty-two years ago and became a murderer only three months ago; that some recent event supplied the motive for the murder; and that the most likely person to have knowledge of that event is Raymond Thorne or someone in his employ who was closely associated with Elinor Denovo." His eyes opened. "I’ll start with Mr. Thorne."
I put the glass with what was left of the Irish on my desk. "Holy heaven. That’s the wildest goose you ever chased."
"Perhaps. Sitting here hour after hour and day after day getting futile reports from you and Saul and Fred and Orrie is affecting my appetite and my palate. This morning I had to read a page twice. Intolerable. Can you have Mr. Thorne here at six o’clock?"
"I can try. Is this just a spasm or do you mean it?"
"I don’t have spasms."

"Leave that, quoting you, to my intelligence guided by experience." "You can’t give him the client’s name."
"Certainly not. But he probably knows it, after that ad."
"Very well. First, Mr. Thorne."
==> It took nearly an hour to get Raymond Thorne because he was somewhere watching TV cameras make a Raymond Thorne production, and when I finally had him he said he couldn’t possibly make it at six o’clock. I reminded him that he had told me he would like to help Amy any way he could, and he said he would come at nine. Getting Inspector Cramer was easier and quicker. He was at his office and would see me. Wolfe had gone up to the plant rooms and I went to the kitchen to tell Fritz I was leaving. <==
The cop at the top of Homicide South could surely have had a bigger room and a bigger desk and better chairs for visitors than the setup on West Twentieth Street, but Cramer liked to stick to things he was used to, including that old felt hat, which was always there on a corner of his desk when it wasn’t on his head, although there was a rack only a step away. I sat on the wooden chair at the end of his desk while he finished with a folder he was going through. When he closed it and turned to me, I said, "I bring hot news. We’re working on that hit- and-run. Mr. Wolfe thought we should tell you because we said we weren’t."
He put on an act. He demanded, "What hit-and-run?"

"Oh, yes. So you’re working on it. So Wolfe wants to know something, so he sends you. He can go to hell."
I nodded. "So you would like to know what he wants to know, so you let me in when you’re busy. I’ll make it brief and answer questions within reason. What we told you was the truth and the whole truth: our only client was and is a woman who wants us to find her father, whom she has never seen. She doesn’t know who or what he was or is, and she wants to. We have smoked out three different Grade A leads, but they have all fizzled. Two full weeks, and we have a load of nothing, either for the client or for you. So an hour ago Mr. Wolfe

"Leave that, quoting you, to my intelligence guided by experience." "You can’t give him the client’s name."
"Certainly not. But he probably knows it, after that ad."
"Very well. First, Mr. Thorne."
It took nearly an hour to get Raymond Thorne because he was somewhere watching TV cameras make a Raymond Thorne production, and when I finally had him he said he couldn’t possibly make it at six o’clock. I reminded him that he had told me he would like to help Amy any way he could, and he said he would come at nine. Getting Inspector Cramer was easier and quicker. He was at his office and would see me. Wolfe had gone up to the plant rooms and I went to the kitchen to tell Fritz I was leaving.
==> The cop at the top of Homicide South could surely have had a bigger room and a bigger desk and better chairs for visitors than the setup on West Twentieth Street, but Cramer liked to stick to things he was used to, including that old felt hat, which was always there on a corner of his desk when it wasn’t on his head, although there was a rack only a step away. I sat on the wooden chair at the end of his desk while he finished with a folder he was going through. When he closed it and turned to me, I said, "I bring hot news. We’re working on that hit- and-run. Mr. Wolfe thought we should tell you because we said we weren’t." <==

The door opened and a uniformed city employee entered, came, and put an old scarred wooden tray on Cramer’s desk blotter. As Cramer nodded thanks and picked up the pot to pour, I asked, "Didn’t the damn fool ever hear of gloves?"


He put the pot down. "They weren’t on the car. On the floor, in front, was a leather cigar case. He got it out to light one while he was parked on Second Avenue waiting for her, and there she came, and he dropped it on the seat..."
My brows were up. "You’re saying it was first-degree."
==> He took a healthy swallow of coffee. I have to sip when it’s that hot. "Wolfe is," he said, "not me. I was doing him a favor, reconstructing it for him. I don’t give a damn how he happened to leave it; we’ve got it. But we can’t match the prints - here, Washington, London - nowhere. There were two cigars in the case. Gold Label Bonitas. Knowing, as I do, the kind of stunts Wolfe is capable of, it was possible he was getting set to ask me if I would care to meet a man who smoked Gold Label Bonitas and was shy a case to carry them in." He drank coffee. <==
"If the case is handy," I said, "I would enjoy looking at it. So I could describe it to Mr. Wolfe."
"It’s at the laboratory. It’s polished black calfskin, not new but not worn much, stamped on the inside ‘Corwin Deluxe.’ No other marks. Nothing special about it to trace."
"I suppose the woman who owned the car - "
The door was opening and a cop stepped in. Cramer asked him, "Yes?" and he said Sergeant So-and-so had arrived with What’s-his-name, and I stood up. It would have been a dumb remark anyway. They have some darned smart dicks at Homicide South, and one of them had certainly asked the owner of the car if the cigar case was hers.

RAYMOND THORNE WAS MORE than half an hour late. It was 9:40 when the doorbell rang and I went and admitted him, took him to the office, introduced him, nodded him to the red leather chair, asked him what he would like to drink, and went to the kitchen to fill his order for brandy and a glass of water.

When the three ‘teers had phoned in with their usual reports, nothing, they had been told to call at nine in the morning. They were the three ‘teers because once

 at a conference Orrie had said they were the three musketeers and we had tried to change it to fit. We tried snoopeteers, privateers (for private eyes), dicketeers, wolf steers, hawketeers, and others, and ended up by deciding that none of them was good enough and settling for the three ‘teers. They had not been told that we were now looking for a murderer, not just a father; I saved that for morning so they would get a good night’s sleep.
==> On the way back from Twentieth Street I had found a cigar counter with a box of Gold Label Bonitas, the third counter I tried, and had bought a couple - two for sixty-five cents - and Wolfe and I had given them a good look. A Gold Label Bonita is four and three-quarters inches long, medium thick, and medium blunt at both ends. It comes in a cellophane tube, and its label says Gold Label but not Bonita. The Bonita is only on the box. I lit one and took a few puffs, but neither Wolfe nor I would claim that if we entered a room where a man had recently smoked a cigar we could testify under oath that it had been a Gold Label Bonita. It did taste and smell like tobacco smoke, which is more than I can say for the - but he may read this. I dropped the other one in a drawer and gave Wolfe a full account of my conversation with Raymond Thorne ten days earlier, which I had never reported verbatim. <==
Thorne’s first remark after a sip of brandy was that a close-up of Wolfe there in his chair, with sprays of orchids scattered over the desk, would make a marvelous shot for a one-minute commercial. He said that of course he didn’t make many commercials, but a friend of his did, and what a picture! Wolfe had to rub his lips with a knuckle to stop the words that wanted out. Thorne was going to help him find a murderer, or he hoped he was.
"My friend would be glad to come and discuss it with you," Thorne said.
"That can wait," Wolfe said. "I’m fully occupied with the job I’m on. On behalf of Miss Denovo, I thank you for coming. I know you told Mr. Goodwin that you could supply no information that would help, but it is a common occurrence for a man to have knowledge of a fact and to be quite unaware of its significance. I once questioned a young woman for three days on what she regarded as irrelevant trivialities, and finally got a fact that exposed a murderer."
"I’m afraid I can’t spare three days." Thorne took a sip of brandy and stirred it in his mouth with his tongue. "This cognac is marvelous. Speaking of facts, evidently you knew one I didn’t, from that ad ... I suppose that ad in the Times

==> Thorne’s first remark after a sip of brandy was that a close-up of Wolfe there in his chair, with sprays of orchids scattered over the desk, would make a marvelous shot for a one-minute commercial. He said that of course he didn’t make many commercials, but a friend of his did, and what a picture! Wolfe had to rub his lips with a knuckle to stop the words that wanted out. Thorne was going to help him find a murderer, or he hoped he was. <==
"My friend would be glad to come and discuss it with you," Thorne said.
"That can wait," Wolfe said. "I’m fully occupied with the job I’m on. On behalf of Miss Denovo, I thank you for coming. I know you told Mr. Goodwin that you could supply no information that would help, but it is a common occurrence for a man to have knowledge of a fact and to be quite unaware of its significance. I once questioned a young woman for three days on what she regarded as irrelevant trivialities, and finally got a fact that exposed a murderer."
"I’m afraid I can’t spare three days." Thorne took a sip of brandy and stirred it in his mouth with his tongue. "This cognac is marvelous. Speaking of facts, evidently you knew one I didn’t, from that ad ... I suppose that ad in the Times

as yours?" "Yes."

 at a conference Orrie had said they were the three musketeers and we had tried to change it to fit. We tried snoopeteers, privateers (for private eyes), dicketeers, wolf steers, hawketeers, and others, and ended up by deciding that none of them was good enough and settling for the three ‘teers. They had not been told that we were now looking for a murderer, not just a father; I saved that for morning so they would get a good night’s sleep.
On the way back from Twentieth Street I had found a cigar counter with a box of Gold Label Bonitas, the third counter I tried, and had bought a couple - two for sixty-five cents - and Wolfe and I had given them a good look. A Gold Label Bonita is four and three-quarters inches long, medium thick, and medium blunt at both ends. It comes in a cellophane tube, and its label says Gold Label but not Bonita. The Bonita is only on the box. I lit one and took a few puffs, but neither Wolfe nor I would claim that if we entered a room where a man had recently smoked a cigar we could testify under oath that it had been a Gold Label Bonita. It did taste and smell like tobacco smoke, which is more than I can say for the - but he may read this. I dropped the other one in a drawer and gave Wolfe a full account of my conversation with Raymond Thorne ten days earlier, which I had never reported verbatim.

as yours?" "Yes."
"Alias Elinor Denovo. Carlotta something alias Elinor Denovo. Why the ‘alias’ if Denovo was her married name? Her daughter’s name is Amy Denovo."
"That’s one of the complications, Mr. Thorne. A client’s communications with a detective she has hired are not legally privileged, but they are often confidential."

"But you still think it was premeditated murder?"
"Miss Denovo does, as Mr. Goodwin told you ten days ago. Do I? Yes, for reasons you might think deficient. But getting you here is not merely stumbling around in the dark. It isn’t fatuous to assume that some recent event induced the murder and that something connected with that event, however remotely, was seen or heard by you. In conversation with her, how did you address her? Mrs. Denovo, or Elinor?"
"Elinor."
"Then I shall. How many others there called her Elinor?" "Why ... Let’s see ... three. No, four."
"Their names?"
==> "Now listen." Thorne flipped a hand. "That wouldn’t be just irrelevant trivialities, it would be drivel. It would take three weeks, not just three days. Goodwin said someone at my place might be involved in it, and I told him there wasn’t the slightest chance. Simply impossible. Nobody there had any personal relations with her. Even I didn’t, actually. We often had meals together, lunch and dinner and even breakfast sometimes, but only to talk business." He turned to me. "I told you I soon saw she had lines she didn’t want crossed." Back to Wolfe: "I can give you the names, sure, but I’m telling you, that will get you nowhere." <==


"I would expect it to. On an excursion such as this you get nowhere again and again. Very well, we’ll try another tack. When and where did you last see Elinor?"
"That Friday around noon at the studio. I was taking a plane to the coast on business, to see a scriptwriter I wanted."
"What studio?"

"I don’t know. My guess was that they were mostly big outfits and she liked the complete freedom she had with me."
"What if I asked you to tell me everything you heard her say that morning? Could you do it?"
"My God, no. Anyway it was just business. There couldn’t possibly have been anything with any hint of what was going to happen to her that night. You know, I might be better at this if I knew why you think it was premeditated murder. Goodwin told me it was Amy’s intuition. Isn’t a hit-and-run nearly always just a hit-and-run?"
"Yes. I would Eke to oblige you, Mr. Thorne, if only as a token of Miss Denovo’s appreciation of your willingness to help, but I can’t divulge information that the police are reserving. Only five hours ago a police officer of high rank, discussing that hit-and-run with Mr. Goodwin, said, ‘He got a cigar out to light it while he was parked on Second Avenue waiting for her, and there she came.’ If I were free to tell you more I would. Help yourself to brandy. If you please, Archie, beer?"
That was a fair example of how to lie while sticking to the truth. It was perfectly true that he couldn’t, or anyhow shouldn’t, divulge information that the police were reserving. It was also true that a high-ranking police officer had said that to me. So a truth plus a truth equaled a bare-faced lie.
==> It was the only one he told during the four long hours that Thorne sat in the red leather chair while downing a third of a bottle of marvelous cognac. I doubted if he knew how good it was; a man had once offered Wolfe fifty bucks for a bottle of it. <==
The four hours took us an hour and a half past midnight, into Friday morning, and the brandy took Thorne into a kind of talking trance that made him forget about time, and also seemed to oil his memory, which was just luck. He remembered Thursday a little better than Friday, and by the time they got back to Monday he was remembering so much that I began to suspect him. He had

 remarked at one point that he had done some scriptwriting, so he had had practice making things up.
But he didn’t make up the thing, the thing that hit. It wasn’t a smack. I damned near let it slide by. I had been sitting there listening to irrelevant trivialities for more than three hours; it was well past midnight, I had covered at least a dozen yawns, and I had been drinking milk, not brandy. They had been on Monday for maybe twenty minutes, and had got to where Thorne and Elinor were on their way out to have lunch with somebody, and Thorne was telling how the receptionist had stopped Elinor to tell her that Floyd Vance had been there again and she had had to threaten to call in a policeman if he didn’t leave. The receptionist said he might be out in the hall. Elinor had thanked her and they had left. Naturally Wolfe had asked who Floyd Vance was, but Thorne knew nothing about him; he said probably some nut who wanted to peddle an idea for a show that the networks would give a million for. They were a dime a dozen.
As I said, I nearly let it slide by. It hit me a little later as I was telling my jaw and cheek muscles to get set to hide another yawn, and I made a mistake. I forgot the yawn and my jaws opened wide for it. That led me into a second mistake, which often happens. Preferring not to let Thorne know that he had told us a fact which might be significant, I tried to go on as I had been for an hour, looking more awake and alert than I was, and I overdid it. If he had been awake and alert he would have noticed it, but by that time his talking trance was in command and it would have made no impression on him if I had wiggled my ears.

So it was only half past one and they had only got to the middle of Monday afternoon when he looked at the clock and said he was too tired to continue, and Thorne must be too. Miss Denovo would deeply appreciate Thorne’s cooperation, and he and Mr. Goodwin would see if they could find a hint in any of the items Thorne had supplied. As Thorne used both hands on the chair arm to get to his feet I was thinking that I would have to steer him out and down the stoop steps, and possibly even go and get the Heron to cart him home, but he did all right. Going down the hall he put a hand to the wall once to steady himself, and outside he stood and brought his shoulders up and took a couple of deep breaths, but he made it down to the sidewalk without any trouble. I stayed to watch him for about thirty paces. Okay.
As I entered the office Wolfe growled at me, "You got something. What?"

I went to my desk and sat. "Nothing would please me more than to catch one you should have caught and missed, but I can’t claim it on this. I think we’ve got a nibble. I don’t know whether it’s the father or the murderer, or possibly both, but I think it’s a nibble. Last Sunday afternoon at Miss Rowan’s place in the country three people came who had not been invited and weren’t expected. Two of them were friends of hers - well, acquaintances; I had met them there before - who have a place half an hour away. The third one was their weekend house guest, a man named Floyd Vance. They said they had mentioned to him that Archie Goodwin was often at Lily Rowan’s for weekends, and he had got them to drive him over because he wanted to meet me. I gathered from what he said that what he really wanted was to meet you. He said he was a public-relations counselor. He said that if anybody needed expert handling of his public image a private detective did, and he would like to create a presentation to propose to you. He also said that if we were working on a case and I would tell him about it, he could use that as a basis for the presentation. At that, naturally, I looked and listened, but decided he was just trying to find another sucker for his racket. I now sincerely hope I was wrong. Two comments. One, there are probably very few Floyd Vances around. Two, allowing for the twenty-three years, he fits Salvatore Manzoni’s description just fine."
"I would like some beer," Wolfe said.

For a second I thought he was walking out, to go to bed with the nibble, but he turned left in the hall. He was going for beer. When he returned he had a bottle and a glass in one hand and a snifter in the other. He put the bottle and glass on his desk, got the cognac bottle from the stand and poured a couple of ounces in the snifter.
"You might easily have missed it," he said, and went around to his chair, opened the bottle, and poured.
I whirled the brandy around in the snifter and said, "I almost did. If it’s only a coincidence I’m through with the detective business for good. We’ll soon know, one way or another.

 is a long time and it might not prove anything. Of course the receptionist at Thorne’s could settle it that it was the public-relations Floyd Vance that she shooed out that May day, but that would only prove that it’s a real nibble."

"Fingerprints," I said.
"Yes," he said.
"We get his and give them to Cramer and they match or they don’t."
"No." He licked foam from his lips. "If they matched we’d be in a fix. Mr. Cramer would have a murderer, but we would still need a father, and he would be locked up and inaccessible. You said he wanted to meet me."
"Yeah. If he’s it, what he really wanted was to find out if we had got anywhere and if so how far. How he knew we were on it is a question, but we don’t have to answer it. Sure, I could get him here, and then what? Do you think you could ask him anything that would help without giving him a guess that we’re on him? I don’t. There would be the same risk in seeing the receptionist at Thorne’s. She might tell him."

"Right." I had emptied the snifter during the lip act, and as he pushed his chair back I went to pour another swallow. It might put me to sleep a few seconds quicker.
12
NOT A FLY. Flies don’t buzz. Mosquito. No. Too loud. What the ... Oh. House phone, for God’s sake. I opened an eye, stretched an arm and got it, said, "Well?"
Fritz’s voice said, "Good morning, Archie. He wants you."
I glared at the clock on the bedstand, realized that it actually said twenty-five minutes past eight, and swung my feet around. Figuring out whether I had failed to turn the alarm on, or it had tried to stir me and it had failed, would have to wait. I called for will power, gave it time to deliver, made it to my feet, concentrated on locating the door, and stepped.
==> The door of Wolfe’s room, which is above the kitchen, at the rear of the house where he gets the sun in winter, stood open. When I entered, with my bare feet making no sound, he was seated at the table, with the Times propped on the rack, dropping a bit of toast into the sauce of eggs au beurre noir. When I cleared my throat he got the toast to and into his mouth before he turned his head. <==
"The time is out of joint," I said.
He frowned. "I don’t talk in quotations, even Shakespeare, and neither do you."

Miss Rowan does sometimes and she likes that one. As you see, I am no longer on daylight saving. Apparently you are." He was fully dressed: a nice clean yellow shirt with narrow maroon stripes, a maroon tie, and a brown summerweight self-striped suit. Up in the plant rooms he would shed the jacket and put on a smock.
He swallowed a bite of egg and said, "It’s nearly nine o’clock."

"By daylight saving, yes, sir. I’ll brief them while I’m eating breakfast."
"Only Saul. We won’t risk it with Fred and Orrie. Tell them to be on call. You and Saul will decide on your approach and you may need them later. First, is he involved? If yes, merely as the murderer, with a motive that doesn’t concern us, or also as the father? We can’t waste our time and the client’s money just on finding a culprit for Mr. Cramer." He dropped toast in the sauce.
==> "I’m waking up," I said. "Or I got ideas in my sleep. Last night I said we don’t have to answer the question how he knew we were on it, but if he’s the father it may be important. If he’s the father there’s some connection between him and Cyrus Jarrett, or why did Jarrett send the checks? And if Jarrett told him that Nero Wolfe is out to find the father, and if he is also the murderer, what about Miss Denovo? We might lose a client. I doubt if you want another casualty like Simon Jacobs on the record, and I certainly don’t. I suggest that we’d better get her out of circulation." <==
He made a face. "Fritz."
That was what he calls flummery. It was true that when, for security reasons, it had been necessary to have a female guest sleeping and eating in the South Room, which is above Wolfe’s, Fritz hadn’t been able to hide how he felt about it, but Wolfe hadn’t even tried to hide how he felt.
"I’m aware," I said, "that if we did it again Fritz might leave and you might too. I don’t mean here. She spends most of her days at Miss Rowan’s, and she could spend her nights there too until we get him or drop him. Miss Rowan has two spare rooms. I’ll suggest it. Anything else?"
He said no and I went back up a flight to do in ten minutes what usually takes me thirty. By the time I got down to the kitchen, having stopped in the office to tell Fred and Orrie that Saul and I were going to pick up a trail and might need them later, my fog was starting to clear.

He swallowed a bite of egg and said, "It’s nearly nine o’clock."
"By daylight saving, yes, sir. I’ll brief them while I’m eating breakfast."
"Only Saul. We won’t risk it with Fred and Orrie. Tell them to be on call. You and Saul will decide on your approach and you may need them later. First, is he involved? If yes, merely as the murderer, with a motive that doesn’t concern us, or also as the father? We can’t waste our time and the client’s money just on finding a culprit for Mr. Cramer." He dropped toast in the sauce.
"I’m waking up," I said. "Or I got ideas in my sleep. Last night I said we don’t have to answer the question how he knew we were on it, but if he’s the father it may be important.

A detective is supposed to get onto things and people, but I gave up long ago trying to get onto Fritz all the way, so I didn’t bother to try to guess how he had known Fred and Orrie would be leaving and Saul would be staying. He knows Saul loves his eggs au beurre noir, and there were two chairs and two places ready at my breakfast table. Saul went to the range to watch him baste, and said he had tried it a hundred times but it never tasted the same. As we ate I told Saul about Floyd Vance and the various angles, and we took our second cups of coffee to the office to consider ways and means. Wolfe had said that the first question was, Is he involved? but Saul agreed with me that it couldn’t do any harm to regard that as answered and proceed accordingly. He also agreed that it would help if he had a look at him, and I got at the phone and dialed the number of Nathaniel Parker, the lawyer.

"Yes, Archie?" I like the way Parker says yes, Archie. He knows that handling something for Wolfe can be interesting but that it may be tough and ticklish, so the yes, Archie is half glad and half sad.
I told him it was nothing much this time. "Just a little chore. A man named Floyd Vance has an office at Four-ninety Lexington Avenue. He’s a counselor, but not at law, at public relations, which as you know is a much newer profession. The chore is to ring him and tell him you have a client who is thinking of engaging his services, and you would like to send a man to discuss it with him. The name of the man is Saul Panzer, whose qualifications you know about. He can go any time, the sooner the better. I’m going out, but Saul will be here to take your call. You have the name? Floyd Vance."
"I have it. What if he wants particulars?" "You’re not prepared to give him any."
"That’s a good way to put it. I am certainly not prepared. Give the genius my regards."
He meant it, but he knew I knew exactly what he would put in a long footnote. I dialed another familiar number to make another request and then went up to my room for a quick shave and change. The ten minutes before breakfast hadn’t been enough.

t was too hot to walk the more than two miles to East Sixty-third Street, and anyway I had told Lily I would be there by eleven-thirty. It was five minutes short of that when I pushed the button at the penthouse door and got a mild surprise when Mimi opened it. When I am expected at a certain hour it’s nearly always Lily who comes, I think on account of some kind of a notion she has about a maid admitting a man who has a key. I have never tried to dope it. Other people’s notions are none of my business unless they get in the way. Then I got a second mild surprise. I had told Lily on the phone that I wanted to see both her and Miss Denovo, but even so, why were they out on the terrace at that hour with a pitcher of iced tea when they should have been inside working? The penthouse was air-conditioned. Was Lily actually still ... To hell with it. I was working. I moved another chair over, between them, sat, accepted an offer of tea with lime and mint, and said, "Don’t mind my manners, I have a busy day ahead." I turned to Lily. "We’re working on a problem for Miss Denovo. We’ve been on it - "
"Archie! No."
==> That was an example of a client’s notion getting in the way. "I’m talking," I told her distinctly and returned to Lily. "It’s very personal and she doesn’t want anyone to know about it, not even you, and I’m proud and happy that she trusts me so much that she calls me Archie, so about her problem I’ll only say that she is not responsible for it. Other people created it; she merely wants to solve it. She came to see Nero Wolfe two weeks ago today." <==
"Why do you - " Amy started, and stopped.
Lily was smiling at me. "Ole, Escamillo," she said, and put a kiss on a fingertip and flipped it to me.
"Last night," I told Amy, "there was a development. With Miss Rowan here I can’t give you the details, and I wouldn’t anyhow at this stage. But it is now more than a wild guess that your mother’s death wasn’t just an accidental hit- and-run, that it was deliberate murder, and if so it’s possible that he has ideas about you. We don’t know - "
"He? Who?"
"You have probably never heard the name we’re interested in, and you won’t hear it now. We don’t know what motive he might have had for your mother, or

"You didn’t drink the tea."
"And I’m thirsty." I picked up the glass, took a couple of swallows, kissed the top of her head, and went.
Before long the day will come, maybe in a year or two, possibly as many as five, when I won’t be able to write any more of these reports for publication. There will be nothing to report because it will be so close to impossible to move around in the city of New York that doing detective work will be restricted to phone calls and distances you can walk, and what could anyone detect? It took a taxi forty-nine minutes that Friday to cover the four miles from East Sixty-third Street to the building where the New York Telephone Company keeps a file of old directories available for researchers, but once there, I needed only nine minutes to learn that Vance, Floyd, was listed in the 1944 Manhattan directory

 and his address had been Ten East Thirty-ninth Street. It had to be a business address, because there were no residential buildings in that block. That was satisfactory on two counts: one, that he had been around in 1944, and two, that his office had been in walking distance of Tufitti’s restaurant on East Forty-sixth Street for lunch or dinner. The next step, naturally, was to have a look at Ten East Thirty-ninth Street, but it had to wait because Saul was expected for lunch and a conference. When my taxi turned into Thirty-fifth Street from Ninth Avenue, Saul was just getting out of one double-parked in front of the old brownstone.
==> The next hour, at the lunch table, provided nourishment for both my stomach and brain. For the stomach, sweetbreads amandine in patty shells and cold green-corn pudding. For the brain, a debate on the question whether music, any music, has, or can have, any intellectual content. Wolfe said no and Saul said yes. I backed Saul because he weighs only about half as much as Wolfe, but I thought he made some very good points, which impressed me because one recent Thursday evening at his apartment he had been playing a piece by Debussy, I think it was, on the piano for Lon Cohen and me while we waited for the others to come for poker, and Lon had said something about the piece’s intellectual force, and Saul had said no music could possibly have intellectual force. As the woman said to the parrot, it depends on who you’re talking to. <==
In the office after lunch I told Wolfe what Saul and I had decided about the approach, including my phone calls to Nathaniel Parker and Lily, and then reported. "I did one thing," I said, "and learned one thing. I arranged for the client to stay put in Miss Rowan’s penthouse until further notice, and I learned that in nineteen forty-four Floyd Vance had a telephone at an office at Ten East Thirty-ninth Street. There wasn’t time to go and have a look, but I know that the wreckers haven’t got to that block and the old buildings on the south side are still there. Unless Saul got something hotter we’ll go and surround it."
Wolfe looked at Saul.
"Nothing even warm," Saul said. "It always helps to see a subject, but Archie had already seen him, so it’s no news that he’s a middle-aged slouch who may have been quite a fine figure twenty-three years ago. He has two little rooms, with him in one and a blonde with too much lipstick in the other, and when I asked about his past and present clients he either had very little to show or he wasn’t showing me. Of course he wanted to know who Parker’s client was, that

 was natural, but he pressed me on it more than he should have. I was getting so little that I almost made a mistake. I thought of asking him if he had ever had a television producer for a client, but of course I didn’t. I was thinking on my way there that it might be possible to get something with a nice collection of his fingerprints on it, but he was right there with me in that little room. If he locks the door when he leaves that would be no problem. The lock’s an ordinary Wingate. Archie or I could open it with our eyes shut."

For two able-bodied, quick-witted, well-trained men Saul and I accomplished a lot in the next two days. He got a haircut, which is quite a feat on a Saturday or Sunday in summer for a man who lives in midtown Manhattan. I detected it when I met him Monday morning. As for me, I frittered away $23.85 of the client’s money on taxi fares and tips between ten a.m. and seven p.m. Saturday, which is also quite a feat. Just three doors away from Ten East Thirty-ninth Street was a lunchroom, Dwyer’s, with a long fountain counter, and the manager told me it had been there for thirty years. He had himself been there nineteen years, and that meant only since 1948, but he knew the name of the man who had preceded him and he had an address in the Bronx where he had lived. The name was Herman Gottschalk, and I spent nine hours trying to track him down so I could show him photographs of seven young women.
That wasn’t dumb; it was merely desperate. Of course the obvious place to look for someone to ask about the tenants and frequenters of that building in 1944 was the building itself, but Saul and I had pretty well covered that Friday afternoon. There was no elevator man or other service man who had been there more-than four years except the building superintendent. He had got the job in 1961, soon after the building had been acquired by its present owner, and he told Saul his predecessor had been there only five years. He didn’t even know the name of the former owner or agent. He did know that none of the present tenants had been there as long as twenty-three years. At the Third Avenue office of the East and West Realty Corporation, the current agent, the only personnel on duty Saturday morning were a girl whose mother should have made her wear teeth braces and an old man with a glass eye who didn’t even know the name of the

 previous owner or agent.

I accomplished something else on Sunday. I took Lily Rowan and Amy Denovo to a double-header at Shea Stadium, and got the client back to the penthouse safe and sound.
Monday morning a sunburned woman at the East and West Realty Corporation gave us the name of the previous agent, Kauffman Management Company, and at their office on Forty-second Street we were lucky enough to find a smart and active young man who believed in giving service. He spent half an hour looking up old records. The man who had been the superintendent at Ten East Thirty- ninth Street in 1944, named William Polk, had died in 1962. There was no record of the names of any of the service personnel, but there was a complete list of the 1944 tenants - twenty-two of them, counting Floyd Vance - and we copied it. The smart young man said there was no one active in the Kauffman Management Company who had been there for twenty-three years. Bernard Kauffman, who had founded it, was dead.
==> Saul and I each took half of the list of tenants and went to work on them. I could make a full report on the first four I tackled, but this is not a treatise on economics or sociology. It was the fifth one that rang the gong, a little before five o’clock in the afternoon - a woman named Dorothy Sebor, fifty, gray-haired and blue-eyed and fully as smart as the young man at the Kauffman Management Company - who beaded and probably owned the Sebor Shopping Service in a tenth-floor suite at Rockefeller Center. She was busy. The forty minutes I spent with her wouldn’t have been more than half that if the phone hadn’t interrupted several times, and I might have had a problem getting to her if I hadn’t sent in word that I wanted to ask her something about Ten East Thirty- ninth Street. When I entered her room she asked if I was the Archie Goodwin who worked for Nero Wolfe, and when I said yes she asked, "But what can I possibly tell you about Ten East Thirty-ninth Street? I left eighteen years ago. I loved that dump. Sit down." <==
I sat. "I don’t know what you can tell me, Miss Sebor, but I know what I want to ask. A job we’re on goes back pretty far and it’s nineteen forty-four we’re interested in. Would you mind telling me what floor you were on?"
"No, why should I? The ninth. In the rear."
"We understand that another of the tenants was named Floyd Vance. Did you

 know him?"

"I don’t know about every day. But most of the time, yes, she was there. He was in public relations. I don’t know if he still is, I know nothing about him. He left Number Ten - I think it was two years after Carlotta left."
"I have the impression that your liking for Carlotta didn’t extend to him,"
"It didn’t. I didn’t know him, really, and I didn’t want to. He thought he was handsome and charming, and perhaps he was, but I thought he was - well, flashy. Not the kind of man I would work either for or with. And if you - good lord, is he your client?"
"He is not. I doubt if there are many men of any kind you would work for or with."
==> She smiled, more with her mouth than her eyes. "I’ve never tried and don’t intend to. I wouldn’t mind having a man of your kind working for me. How much does Nero Wolfe pay you?" <==
"Nothing. I work for love of the job. I meet interesting people like you. If I get fed up and quit I’ll come and remind you. Speaking of quitting, do you suppose Carlotta quit Vance because her opinion of him was about the same as yours? She might have said - "
The phone again - an important customer, judging from the conversation - and then she made calls to two employees, giving one of them detailed instructions and the other one hell. As she hung up she looked at her watch. "It’s getting late," she said, "and I have a pile of work."
"So have I, thanks to you." I rose to my feet. "Do you suppose your opinion of Vance rubbed off on Carlotta?"
"I doubt it. If it did she wouldn’t have told me. She was very ... self-contained." "Do you shake hands with men?"
She laughed - a good healthy laugh. "Occasionally. If I want them to do something."

I got my feet to the floor, no hurry, straightened up, and bent over to put my shoes on. When I am doing desk work the door to the hall and most of the room are behind me, and on the wall back of my desk is a mirror five feet wide and four feet high, for keeping an eye on people. I used it to put my tie on, combed my hair with my fingers, swiveled, and said, "I don’t suppose you’ll ever want the painful details of what led up to it, but if you do I’ll be glad to oblige. An hour and a half ago a woman named Dorothy Sebor who runs, repeat runs, a shopping service in Rockefeller Center, said to me, ‘But what can I possibly tell you about Ten East Thirty-ninth Street? I left there eighteen years ago. I loved that dump. Sit down.’ If you don’t mind I’ll use my formula, not yours. I prefer ‘I’ and ‘she’ to ‘Goodwin’ and ‘Sebor.’"


I gave it to him verbatim, with him, as always, leaning back with his eyes closed. When I finished he sat for a full minute, no movement, and then moved only his lips to mutter, "Very satisfactory."
"It was about time," I said with feeling. "Questions." His eyes opened. "Why roses?"
==> I nodded. "I expected that. It came out without thinking, probably because she had struck me as not the type for orchids. She could probably get a lot more for Nero Wolfe orchids than for run-of-the-nursery roses." <==
"We’ll send her some sprays of Phalaenopsis Aphrodite. They have never been finer. Having had time to consider it, you regard the job as finished?"
"I was just smacking my lips after so many hungry days. One will get you fifty that Floyd Vance is the father, but I admit it wouldn’t be enough for a jury. It might be enough for the client, but I also admit there are other angles."
"Specify them."
"Well. The angle most important to us is your honor. Four days ago I said to Cramer, ‘I am authorized to give you Mr. Wolfe’s word of honor that if we get anything you might be able to use we’ll pass it on to you before we make any use of it ourselves.’ I added, ‘At least two minutes before,’ but that didn’t cancel the commitment. We now have these items: One: Carlotta Vaughn became pregnant in the summer of nineteen forty-four and almost certainly wasn’t married. Two: she spent the entire summer of nineteen forty-four in close association with Floyd Vance. Three: on Monday, May twenty-second, nineteen sixty-seven, four days before Carlotta Vaughn, who was then Elinor Denovo, died, Floyd Vance tried to see her and was chased by the receptionist, and he had been trying to see her before. I’d hate to undertake to tell Cramer that those three items, taken together, are not something he might be able to use. Of course your honor is your lookout, but I mortgaged it."
He grunted. "My lookout and my responsibility. Go on."

"Then the angle that may interest me more than it does you. My honor isn’t involved, but my feelings are, because I got my ass kicked twice by Cyrus M.

Jarrett and I would like to return the compliment. What kind of a connection was there, and is there, between Jarrett and Vance that caused Jarrett to start sending checks to Carlotta Vaughn, alias Elinor Denovo, two weeks after her baby was born and to keep on sending them until her death? That could be another item that Cramer might be able to use, but that’s not why I want to know. Also, of course, Miss Denovo would like to know. I believe in satisfying the client. I also believe in satisfying me. All right, I withdraw my brag; the job is not finished. It’s your move."
I expected him to start the lip act, but he merely cocked his head. "The point," he said, "is that we don’t know which of two alternative situations faces us. If he is the father but not a murderer, establishing it will be difficult if not impossible. He did that many years ago. But if he is also a murderer the situation is much simpler; he did that only three months ago. We’ll resolve that and then decide how to proceed. Can you get him here this evening?"

"For what? Do I ask him if he still wants to meet you?"
"That would do to start. If he says no, tell him I want to meet him. Tell him I want to ask him why he didn’t reply to the advertisement requesting information about Carlotta Vaughn, alias Elinor Denovo."
I had noted the listing of Vance’s home phone, but got the directory to check on the number, and found that my memory had it right. It was a quarter to seven when I dialed, and if he ate out I would probably get no answer. But after two rings I got a hello.
"Mr. Floyd Vance, please?" "I’m Floyd Vance."
==> "I’m Archie Goodwin. I work for Nero Wolfe. You may remember that we met at Lily Rowan’s place, and you - " <==
"I remember."
"And you said you would like to meet Nero Wolfe to make a proposal. I reminded Mr. Wolfe of that just now when we were discussing something, and he decided he would also like to meet you. Could you come this evening, say at nine o’clock?"

Silence. Five seconds. "This is short notice."
"I know. It’s not as urgent as a five-alarm fire, but if it’s not too inconvenient... the address is - "

As I hung up, the doorbell rang, and I went, expecting Saul, and it was. I opened the door only a couple of inches and said through the crack, "You may not want to come in. No champagne. There are angles."
It was my fault. When Saul had phoned I had just got home, so pleased with myself and wanting to spread joy around that I had not only invited him to dinner but had also told him I would have a bottle of Dom Perignon ready to open. Then the angles had made it obvious that putting champagne in the refrigerator would be premature and I hadn’t gone to the kitchen. Not that Saul needed any explanations or apologies; that long dry spell had got on his nerves too.
Anyway, along with the clams and broiled turtle steaks he drank more than half of a bottle of Montrachet, so all he missed was bubbles.
==> With coffee, in the office after dinner, we settled the program. When Vance arrived Saul would go to the front room, and as soon as the guest was in the office and seated he would leave, to go to 490 Lexington Avenue and collect likely objects for fingerprints. Since he had seen the lock he knew which keys to take from the assortments in the cabinet, and after he made his selections he helped me prepare the props in the office. We did a thorough wiping job on twelve objects: the stand by the red leather chair, two ash trays - one on the stand and one on the corner of Wolfe’s desk - two photographs of Elinor Denovo in a drawer of Wolfe’s desk, four glasses of different kinds, since we didn’t know what he would drink, two books of matches - one on the stand and one on Wolfe’s desk - and every inch of the red leather chair. Now and then I took a second for a glance at Wolfe, for comic relief. He sat with his fingers laced at the summit of his center mound, scowling at us. He knew darned well that what we were doing was a lot more important than anything he could possibly be thinking, and it hurt. He would have loved to take the position, and hold it, that <==

 he could solve any problem on earth or in outer space by leaning back and closing his eyes and working his lips. The trouble was that the little chores Saul and I did for him were nearly always done somewhere else, but that time it was going on right there in his office, before his eyes. I was surprised that he didn’t get up and go to the kitchen.
Amy’s father rang the doorbell at ten after nine. As I went to admit him Saul headed for the connecting door to the front room, and as I took him to the office and to the red leather chair I did something that I had done many times although I had learned long ago that it was absolutely useless. For a spectator in a courtroom to try to decide from a man’s looks if he’s guilty or not is natural and he has to pass the time somehow, but for a working detective it’s pure crap. So I did it again. I looked at Vance’s purled eyes, flabby cheeks, thin hair, saggy shoulders, down to his brown shoes that needed a shine, actually hoping to get a slant on the question, Did he kill Elinor Denovo? Nuts.
By the time I got to nuts Wolfe was saying, "... not that I scorn all trite expressions; some of the finest words and phrases in the language were once vulgarisms and are well worn. But a faddish cliché like ‘image’ as now abused is an abomination. You told Mr. Goodwin that my ‘public image’ needs expert handling and you would like to meet me. If you have some proposal to make I’ll listen as a matter of courtesy, but don’t call my repute my image."
"To hell with your courtesy. Shove it." Vance’s voice was not as I remembered it. I had thought he was a fairly smooth talker that Sunday, but now the words came out blurry. He went on, "I’ve learned something about you since I talked with Goodwin. You don’t give a damn about your public image. Did you get me here just to tell me you don’t like clichés? Do I go home now?"

Fritz, having been told that he wouldn’t be needed, had gone out. In the kitchen I put Wolfe’s beer and glass on a tray, and on another tray a wiped glass, a bowl which I wiped before putting ice cubes in it, a pitcher which I wiped before putting water in it, and a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black which I also wiped. That took a while and made me miss something. When I got to the office with the trays Vance had used his hands some more and had a cigar lit, so I didn’t know if he carried them loose or in a case, or if he had used the matches on the stand. The cigar was a long panatela, nothing like a Gold Label Bonita, but that didn’t bother me; if he had left that case in the hit-and-run car it would have been common prudence to switch. After serving the trays I went back to the kitchen for a glass of milk and when I returned to the office Vance had his glass in his hand and Wolfe was talking.

In the kitchen I put Wolfe’s beer and glass on a tray, and on another tray a wiped glass, a bowl which I wiped before putting ice cubes in it, a pitcher which I wiped before putting water in it, and a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black which I also wiped. That took a while and made me miss something. When I got to the office with the trays Vance had used his hands some more and had a cigar lit, so I didn’t know if he carried them loose or in a case, or if he had used the matches on the stand. The cigar was a long panatela, nothing like a Gold Label Bonita, but that didn’t bother me; if he had left that case in the hit-and-run car it would have been common prudence to switch. After serving the trays I went back to the kitchen for a glass of milk and when I returned to the office Vance had his glass in his hand and Wolfe was talking.
"... for I have no intention or desire to make any demand or indictment, and I don’t think my client has either. I want only what I have been hired to get, information. I can’t name my client, but if my questions reveal her identity to you, that in itself would answer my basic question. The advertisement plainly implied that the woman once known as Carlotta Vaughn was later known as Elinor Denovo, but if you prefer to tell me nothing about Elinor Denovo we’ll restrict it to Carlotta Vaughn. By the way..."
He opened a drawer and took out the two photographs. I had cautioned him not to handle them in a way that would make it obvious that he was taking care not to leave prints - the Police Department files already had samples of his - and he did all right, perfectly normal as he handed them to me and I passed them on to

 Vance.
==> "She was Elinor Denovo when those were taken," Wolfe said, "but had been Carlotta Vaughn only a year or two previously, so you should recognize her." <==
Vance handled them normally too. He had put his glass down, and with one in each hand he gave them a look, first the three-quarters face and then the profile. He looked at Wolfe. "So what? Sure I recognize her." He put the photographs on the stand. "I’m not denying that I once knew a woman named Carlotta Vaughn." He picked up his glass and drank.
"When and where did you first meet her?"
"In the spring of nineteen forty-four." He was no longer blurring his words; apparently a few swallows of Scotch with very little water had helped. "I think it was late March. My God, it was twenty-three years ago."
"Where?" Wolfe had opened his bottle but hadn’t poured.
"I don’t remember. I suppose some party. I was under thirty and I got around." "And you hired her?"

"Well... yes."
"You paid her a salary?"
Vance took a swallow. "Look," he said, "I’m not going to toot my horn. As I said, I was under thirty, and girls were no problem. They seemed to like my style. This Carlotta Vaughn got it hard. I wasn’t setting any rivers on fire in my business and she knew it - what the hell, everybody knew it - and she wanted to help, and she was smart. So I let her help. No, I didn’t pay her."
"How long did she continue to help?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 79626    window = 79621 79631


"How long did she continue to help?"
"Oh, all summer. Into fall. Six months, perhaps seven." "Why did she stop?"
"I didn’t ask her. She just stopped."

think you can improve on that, Mr. Vance. Didn’t she stop because she was pregnant?"
==> Vance tapped ashes from the cigar into the ash tray, put it between his lips and found it was out, took the book of matches from the stand and lit it, and blew smoke. He looked at Wolfe, opened his mouth and shut it, reached for the bottle and poured Scotch, picked up the glass, took a swig, and looked at Wolfe again. <==
"Yes," he said. "She was storked. So she said. It didn’t show." "So you had impregnated her."
"The hell I had."
"Certainly."
"For God’s sake. She was a nymph. She was a goddam tart. She didn’t know herself who knocked her up. She admitted it. To me."
That showed, if we had needed showing, how impossible it would be to tag him as the father. There were three people - Raymond Thorne, Bertram McCray, and Dorothy Sebor - who would contradict him on Carlotta Vaughn’s morals and habits, and we could probably get more, but that would just be a squabble. However, he had a wide-open flank. What would he or could he say to the question, why did Cyrus M. Jarrett send her a thousand dollars a month as long as she lived? I decided he could say, and almost certainly would say, search me. Wolfe was probably making the same decision. He had poured beer and was watching the bead go down; of course he could merely have been thinking that Vance had used a cliché that was still a vulgarism. He turned his head to me and asked, "Is there any point in persisting?"

Meaning, have we got enough fingerprints? "No," I said. Meaning yes.
He looked at his glass. The foam was down to the right level, exactly. He pushed his chair back, rose, and walked out. As he disappeared in the hall I told myself, for the twentieth time, that the furniture should be rearranged, so he wouldn’t have to detour around the red leather chair when there was someone in it. An exit like that should be a beeline so you can stride.


I told Vance, "Serves you right. You used another cliché."

"Sure, after you’ve gone."
"What the hell, you could have asked me on the phone, any time, if I knocked her up and I would have told you."
"Yeah, I tried to tell him that. He thought that question was too personal for the phone. Also he likes to do things the hard way, and he likes to hear himself talk."
He looked at his glass, saw that there was a couple of fingers in it, picked it up, and drained it. "I thought he was going to ..." He let it hang, and started over. "He said he would like to know why I tried to see that Elinor Denovo. What the hell, I wanted that account, Raymond Thorne Productions. I didn’t know she was Carlotta Vaughn. The first I heard of that was that ad in the paper."
"You don’t hear an ad in the paper. You hear an ad on the radio. You see an ad in the paper. On television you both hear it and see it. It’s getting very complicated, and before we know it we’ll - "
==> "Balls. I’ve heard enough of you. You’re a pair of goddam loudmouths." It wasn’t as easy as falling off a log to rise from that chair, and four of his fingertips pressed against the leather arm as he used leverage. When he was erect he told me to go do something, still another vulgar cliché, and I moved to get to the hall ahead of him; he might turn left instead of right, and Wolfe was in the kitchen. I didn’t go to the front to open the door for him. Not because he was a liar; it just didn’t seem to be called for. <==
When the door had shut behind him, with a bang, I went and opened the kitchen door enough to call through, "Company’s gone!" and then to the stairs down to the basement storeroom for empty cartons and tissue paper and twine.
When I got back up to the office, loaded, Wolfe was standing at the end of his desk, frowning around at everything in sight. I put the cartons down on the couch and the paper and twine on my desk, and said, "I wouldn’t trade images with that specimen, public or private. I have never felt so sorry for a client. If she had known what she was going to get for her twenty grand ..."

He growled. "How long will that cigar smoke last?"
"The air conditioner will do it in about an hour." I was gently wrapping in tissue paper the glass that had held Scotch. "I need your help on a decision. The bottle is more than half full of Johnnie Walker Black. About six dollars’ worth. Do we donate it to Cramer or do I empty it?"

"Empty it hi the sink. It’s contaminated. Confound this smell. I’m going upstairs, but there’s a letter to write. Your notebook."
I went and sat, and for the first tune in I don’t know how long he dictated a letter standing.

He pinched his nose, told me good night, and headed for the door.

WHEN I ARRIVED AT the headquarters of Homicide South on West Twentieth Street at a quarter to nine Tuesday morning, I was on the fence. I wanted the cartons to get to Cramer as soon as possible, but if he was there I didn’t want to deliver them to him myself, because as soon as he read the letter I would be stuck. He would hold me until the prints had been lifted and compared, and if they matched I would be held tighter and longer. So I was just as well pleased that he hadn’t come yet. Neither had Purley Stebbins, but I got a sergeant I knew named Berman. When he saw the six cartons, one big enough to hold a wastebasket, which was one of the items Saul had brought from 490 Lexington Avenue, he said he hoped it wasn’t all bombs and I said no, only one was, and the trick was to guess which. He put the letter in his pocket and promised to give it to Cramer as soon as he came.

t would be instructive to report how Saul got a big wastebasket out of that office building at ten o’clock at night, but it would take a page.
==> Home again, having had only orange juice before leaving, I ate breakfast, tried to find something in the Times that deserved attention, and expected. The trouble with expecting is that you always jump the gun. It could take anywhere from one to eight hours for them to get the prints lifted and compared, but as I went to the office to dust and tear pages from desk calendars and put fresh water in the vase on Wolfe’s desk and open the mail, I was expecting the phone to ring any minute. You simply can’t help it, especially when you have no good reason to bet a dime either way on what you’re expecting. If the fingerprints didn’t match we were left with a Grade A mess and no way on earth of making a neat package of it to deliver to the client; if they did match we could take our pick of three or four different ways to play it and they all looked good. So I expected, and although I opened the mail and gave it a look before putting it under the chunk of jade on Wolfe’s desk, I had no clear idea what was in it. One thing, not in the mail, did get some real attention. Saul and I had decided that we almost certainly had enough without lifting the prints from the red leather chair. We had got bed sheets from the closet and draped them over it, and there it was, and it looked pretty silly. I removed the sheets, folded them, and put them back in the closet. What the hell, as Amy’s father would say, I was there on guard. Returning to the office, I looked at my watch for about the tenth time since breakfast, saw that it was 10:38, and decided it was time to consider it calmly and realistically. To begin with, if the prints didn’t match there was nothing to expect. Some detective second grade would phone in a day or two to tell me to come and get the junk I had left there. If they did match the best guess was that Lieutenant Rowcliff or Sergeant Stebbins would phone around two or three o’clock and tell me they wanted me there quick. Or possibly - <==
The doorbell rang and I went to the hall and saw Cramer and Stebbins on the stoop.
Ordinarily the sight of a pair of cops wanting in doesn’t scatter my wits, but as I started for the front I had room in my skull for only one item: the beautiful fact that the prints had matched and Floyd Vance had murdered Elinor Denovo. I should have realized that their coming twenty minutes before eleven o’clock, when they knew Wolfe wouldn’t be available, showed that it would take handling. Before I opened up I should have put the chain bolt on, holding the door to a two-inch crack, since it would have taken a warrant to open it legally and they wouldn’t have one, and we could discuss the situation. But I was so

 glad to see them that I swung the door wide, and I was probably showing my teeth in a big grin of welcome. If so, it soon went. They came in fast, Stebbins’ shoulder jostling me as he passed, headed for the rear, and started up the stairs.
A cop inside the house is a very different problem from one outside. Once he’s inside legally, and I had opened the door, about all you can do is sit down and write a letter to the Supreme Court. Even if I could beat them to the plant rooms, and I couldn’t, since the elevator was up there, what good would it do? I went to the kitchen to tell Fritz what had happened and that I was going up to join the party, and then took my time mounting the three flights.

To go through those three rooms, the cool, the moderate, and the warm, down the aisles between the benches, without being stopped by a color or a shape that you didn’t know existed, your mind must be fully occupied with something else.

I walked the aisle and opened the door to the potting room, and there they were. Wolfe, in a yellow smock, was on his stool at the big bench. Theodore was standing over by the pot racks. Stebbins was off to the right. Cramer, in the center of the room, had his felt hat off and in his hand, I don’t know why. Facing Wolfe, he was telling him, louder than necessary, "...and hold you as material witnesses until we get warrants and then, by God, you go to a cell. All right, talk or move."
Wolfe stayed on the stool. His eyes came to me. "Any complaint, Archie?" "Only their bad manners. Next time they’ll talk through a crack."

If you put hands on me, and Mr. Goodwin, and take us elsewhere, we’ll stand mute and communicate with our lawyer. When he comes we’ll confer with him privately, and the afternoon paper, the Gazette, and tomorrow morning’s papers, will publish the news that Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin have discovered the identity of the murderer of Elinor Denovo and have delivered satisfactory evidence to the police. Also, that in recognition of that public service they have been arrested and are behind bars, and their lawyer is arranging to secure their release on bail. Archie, here, please. This Miltonia charlesworthi germination card has conflicting entries. We’ll have to check it."
I went and took the card and scowled at it.

If you put hands on me, and Mr. Goodwin, and take us elsewhere, we’ll stand mute and communicate with our lawyer. When he comes we’ll confer with him privately, and the afternoon paper, the Gazette, and tomorrow morning’s papers, will publish the news that Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin have discovered the identity of the murderer of Elinor Denovo and have delivered satisfactory evidence to the police. Also, that in recognition of that public service they have been arrested and are behind bars, and their lawyer is arranging to secure their release on bail. Archie, here, please. This Miltonia charlesworthi germination card has conflicting entries. We’ll have to check it."
I went and took the card and scowled at it.


Cramer was in a box. My taking him the contents of those cartons and the letter, if the prints matched, certainly made us material witnesses, but if he herded us downtown and we performed as programmed by Wolfe, and we would, he would have to plug his ears for the horse laughs. If he and Stebbins waited there to go down to the office with us there was nowhere to sit, and standing around waiting may be all right for a sergeant but not for an inspector.

 glad to see them that I swung the door wide, and I was probably showing my teeth in a big grin of welcome. If so, it soon went. They came in fast, Stebbins’ shoulder jostling me as he passed, headed for the rear, and started up the stairs.
A cop inside the house is a very different problem from one outside. Once he’s inside legally, and I had opened the door, about all you can do is sit down and write a letter to the Supreme Court. Even if I could beat them to the plant rooms, and I couldn’t, since the elevator was up there, what good would it do? I went to the kitchen to tell Fritz what had happened and that I was going up to join the party, and then took my time mounting the three flights.
To go through those three rooms, the cool, the moderate, and the warm, down the aisles between the benches, without being stopped by a color or a shape that you didn’t know existed, your mind must be fully occupied with something else. That time mine was. In the middle room I could already hear a voice, and when I opened the door to the warm room I could name it. Cramer. I walked the aisle and opened the door to the potting room, and there they were. Wolfe, in a yellow smock, was on his stool at the big bench. Theodore was standing over by the pot racks. Stebbins was off to the right. Cramer, in the center of the room, had his felt hat off and in his hand, I don’t know why. Facing Wolfe, he was telling him, louder than necessary, "...and hold you as material witnesses until we get warrants and then, by God, you go to a cell. All right, talk or move."
Wolfe stayed on the stool. His eyes came to me. "Any complaint, Archie?" "Only their bad manners. Next time they’ll talk through a crack."

Stebbins muttered, apparently to himself, "God, I’d love to knock him off that stool." He looked at Cramer. "We take ‘em down and lock ‘em up and kick ‘em out before the lawyer comes."

Actually Cramer is not a fool, not at all. Stebbins must have sold him the bright idea of coming before eleven and invading the plant rooms. He jerked his head and a hand toward the door, an order, and the sergeant obeyed. He stepped to the door and opened it, and when Cramer was through he followed him, leaving the door wide open. Theodore went and shut it, and Wolfe looked at the electric clock which controlled the temperature and some of the ventilation. It was six minutes to eleven.
I asked, "Is this card really off?"
"No. Stay here." He turned to Theodore. "Those Odontoglossum pyramus aren’t ready for sevens: Put them in sixes. Do you agree?"
"No," Theodore said. "A little extra room won’t hurt them any."

I didn’t listen to that argument, which took ten minutes; I was concentrating on what Cramer and Stebbins would find when they went through our desks, and congratulating myself for having undraped the red leather chair. I had to stay, of course, not only because Wolfe had told me to; if I had followed them down they would have started in on me and I might overdo it, the way I felt.
They would probably be expecting us to come down together in the elevator, so when Wolfe left the stool and unbuttoned the smock I said I would take the stairs and went. Since all three flights are carpeted, noise was no problem, and they didn’t even know I was there, in the office doorway, until I spoke. Stebbins was seated at my desk, with two drawers open, and Cramer was over by the cabinets but with none of them open because they had locks.

Cramer about-faced and narrowed his eyes at me. Stebbins merely took more papers from a drawer and started leafing through them. A cop inside the house. The sound came of the elevator descending, and it stopped, and as Wolfe came I stepped into the office. He entered, halted, shot a glance at Cramer, glared at Stebbins, who went right on with papers, and said, "Get Mr. Parker. I’ll take it in the kitchen."
"What did you expect?" Cramer demanded. "Knock it off, Purley. Goodwin wants his chair. Come on, move!"

I would like to exclude you too, but someone even less tolerable would probably replace you. Archie. On a letterhead, Mr. Vance’s name and both addresses and telephone numbers. One carbon."
It took longer than usual to get paper and carbon in the typewriter on account of the mess Stebbins had made. As I typed Cramer said something, saw that Wolfe wasn’t listening and didn’t intend to, and shut his trap. As I rolled the paper out Wolfe said, "One to each," and I went and handed Cramer the original and Stebbins the carbon, and Wolfe told Cramer, "Get him out of here."

So that man was out of there.

We’ve given you the name of a man you’ve been seeking for more than three months. What else do you want?"

The air conditioning had dried the sweat on Cramer’s forehead and taken some of the red from his face. "I want plenty," he said. "I want one good reason why you and Goodwin shouldn’t be charged with withholding information of a crime and obstructing justice. I want to know how long you have known that this Floyd Vance was the driver of that hit-and-run car, and how you spotted him. I want to know if he’s the father you said you were looking for, and if so, and Elinor Denovo was the mother, I want to know why he killed her."
"That will take a lot of talking, Mr. Cramer." "It sure will. Even for you. Go right ahead."
Wolfe adjusted his bulk in the chair. "First, withholding information. Last Thursday Mr. Goodwin gave you our word that if we got anything you might be able to use we would pass it on to you before we made any use of it ourselves. We got those fingerprints late last evening and delivered them to you early this morning, and we have made no use of them and don’t intend to. I have no other information that you might be able to use, in my judgment."
"To hell with your judgment. If you think you can decide - "
"If you please. You told me to talk. As I told you, my client was, and is, a young woman who hired me to find her father. We found one likely prospect but investigation conclusively eliminated him. We found another, but he too was eliminated. I was inclined to return the retainer and withdraw, and persisted only because I am what I call tenacious and Mr. Goodwin calls pigheaded. Do you recognize the name Raymond Thorne?"

Raymond Thorne? No."
"Doubtless some of your staff would. Elinor Denovo spent most of her adult life working for him. Raymond Thorne Productions. Television. He came at my request last Thursday evening and answered questions for more than four hours, and one of the many things I learned was that a man named Floyd Vance had tried several times last May to see Elinor Denovo, and she had refused to see him. His last attempt to see her was on the twenty-second of May, only four days before she died. If you had questioned the receptionist at Raymond Thorne Productions with sufficient perseverance you might have solved that case long ago. We made long and laborious inquiries about Floyd Vance and discovered that he had known Elinor Denovo in nineteen forty-four, when she was Carlotta Vaughn, and had seen her frequently for several months. It was possible that he was the father I was trying to find, and we tackled him. He is a self-styled public-relations counselor - one of the various modem activities that are an insult to the dignity of man. Mr. Goodwin got him here last evening. Preparations had been made. His attempts to see Elinor Denovo shortly before her death prompted the surmise that he had killed her, and, knowing that you had fingerprints, Mr. Goodwin and Mr. Panzer made proper arrangements. That was fortunate, but not for me, for you. Without that you would probably never have found him. And here you come - "

rageous performance. It won’t be easy - especially the sight of that creature at Mr. Goodwin’s desk, deranging his and my belongings, while you stood and applauded."
"I did not applaud. Your usual exaggeration." "You permitted."
"Oh, skip it. A cop gets habits like everybody else. He was looking for information, not evidence. Even if he had found Goodwin’s signed confession that he had killed Elinor Denovo it wouldn’t have been admissible evidence; ask the Supreme Court." Cramer looked at his watch and then at me. "How long has he been gone?"
"Maybe fifteen minutes," I told him. "When you get up don’t put your hand on the right chair arm. It has four Floyd Vance prints on it."
==> "Thanks for telling me." He put both palms on the right chair arm and twisted around as he got to his feet. He faced Wolfe. "I want to be there when he brings him in. I admit you sound good, but you nearly always do sound good. I’m buying nothing, at least not until I see this Floyd Vance. If it goes one way you may hear from me, and if it goes another way you will hear from me. Have I ever thanked you for anything?" <==
"No."
"And I’m not thanking you now. Not yet." He turned and went. I stayed put.
Wolfe opened his desk drawer to take another look, and I attacked the mess Stebbins had made. Vandalism. There was no danger that he had taken anything important because no classified items were ever left in an unlocked drawer, and after getting things in order and back where they belonged I decided that he had taken nothing, except possibly a few of my calling cards. That suggested the question, if it’s illegal for a private detective to impersonate a cop why isn’t it illegal for a cop to impersonate a private detective? I would ask Wolfe. He had shut the drawer and was leaning back, looking thoughtful but not concentrated. When I turned to him he nodded and said, "Phalaenopsis Aphrodite sanderiana."
I said, "If this is a quiz: rose, brown, purple, and yellow."
"We’ll send some to that Dorothy Sebor, and I’ll go up and get them now. I

"No. There is nothing you can do."
"Saul is standing by. So are Fred and Orrie."
"Release them. There is nothing. Our next step is obvious, but it must wait until Mr. Cramer learns his motive. If he learns his motive. He should, with a thousand trained men."
After the sound came of the elevator starting up I sat and looked it over from every angle. It was nice to know the next step was obvious, but it would have been even nicer to know what it was.

==> I DIDN’T KNOW THEN, and I still don’t, exactly how long it took the city employees to find out why Floyd Vance killed Elinor Denovo. I mean really wrap it up. All I know is that Cramer’s phone call didn’t come until 6:38 p.m. Thursday, just in time to make me late at the poker party again. And I still didn’t know what the obvious step was. One of the eighty-seven facts about Wolfe that I would change if I knew how is that he doesn’t believe in talking merely to satisfy anyone’s curiosity, even mine. I admit that in this case there might have been other factors - for instance, he might have wanted to see if I would dope it out for myself and make some suggestions. You probably have, but maybe you wouldn’t if you had been in my shoes, waiting for a development which depended entirely on other people, and you didn’t know what they were doing and not doing. <==
I did do one thing. When I learned from the noon news broadcast on Wednesday that Floyd Vance was being held without bail, and rang Lon Cohen to check it, I phoned Lily Rowan to say I wanted to see the client and was invited to lunch; and after we had finished the lobster salad and cantaloupe mousse and had gone out’ to the terrace, I told Amy that there was no more danger of her being a special target and if she went out for a walk her chances of getting back in one

iece were as good as anybody else’s. Naturally she wanted to know what had happened, and Lily did too, and I think that was the first and only time that Lily suspected me of putting on an act in connection with my work. She remembered that she had a date, some kind of a committee meeting, which I doubted, and left me there with Amy. I admit she thought she was being considerate, but it was no favor to me. I had been stalling Amy for two weeks and she wanted to know, and I couldn’t blame her. Usually you can tell a client something, but I had already told her that her mother’s name was Carlotta Vaughn, and there was absolutely nothing that I was ready to add. When I left I wasn’t at all sure that I was still the one man in the world she could trust.
Of course I read every word in the Wednesday and Thursday papers about the hit-and-run driver the police had nabbed after three months, but learned nothing about motive. I got the impression that the fingerprints which had identified him had been secured by extremely competent detective work by the Homicide Bureau, but there were no published details about it. There was no mention of Nero Wolfe or Archie Goodwin. There was a lot of new information, new to me, about Floyd Vance, and one item cleared up a point that I had wondered about. In 1944 he had been in his late twenties and single, and why hadn’t he been sent, either to Europe or to Asia, to help several million of his fellow citizens do some expert handling of the public image of the United States of America? According to Wednesday’s Gazette and News, and Thursday’s Times, he had been excused because he had some kind of a trick knee. Other items, though they cleared up nothing, told me more about him - for instance, that he had always been a tadpole in a big frog pond as a public-relations counselor. Evidently he had had very little effect on the dignity of man, either way.
When the phone rang at 6:38 p.m. Thursday, I was at my desk working on germination records and Wolfe was at his with a book he had just started on, an advance copy of The Future of Germany, by Karl Jaspers. I reached for the receiver.

"I want Wolfe, Goodwin. Cramer."
"Greetings." Without bothering to cover the transmitter, I turned my head and said, "Cramer," perhaps a little louder than usual, and Wolfe reached for his phone, perhaps a little faster than usual. I kept mine.

"That’s why I never use it. And I doubt if you can use what I’m giving you. We’ve got a motive for Floyd Vance that’s plenty good enough and it will be even better before we’re through, but her motive for cooking him is your problem, not mine. It could be that she decided to even up for something that happened back in nineteen forty-four, but I’m glad we don’t have to dig that deep.

 and spend another evening in that chair. He’s not available."
"No. I was hoping for something useful, and apparently I’ll have to accept defeat. But I am obliged to you. Sincerely obliged."
"That’s a line to hang up on," Cramer said, and hung up.

inch. He looked at me and said, "Satisfactory."
"Satisfactory hell," I said, "it’s perfect. Simply marvelous. Do I make out a check for Miss Denovo for twenty grand?"
"Not now. That may come later." He looked at the clock. "Get Mr. Jarrett. I’ll talk."
My brows went up. "Father or son?" "Mr. Cyrus M. Jarrett."
I nodded. "Yeah. I admit I’m fairly good at filling orders, but this time I need specifications. My batting record for getting Cyrus M. Jarrett to the phone is nothing for two. I think the person I get is named Oscar."

"My name is Nero Wolfe. I am calling from New York. I wish to speak to Mr. Jarrett. Tell him - don’t interrupt me. Tell him that I wish to speak with him about Floyd Vance. Repeat that name."
"But Mr. Jarrett is eating - "
"I told you to repeat that name. Floyd Vance." "Floyd Vance."

Good. Mr. Jarrett will be able to hear you. He doesn’t eat with his ears. Tell him that I must speak with him now about Floyd Vance. You have my name?"

"Yes, sir."
"I’ll hold the wire, but don’t keep me waiting."
I probably wasn’t breathing. It was a king-size gamble, and I was posting no odds. Too much depended on it. So the obvious step was drawing to what could be an inside straight. Not only was it possible that there was no close connection between Jarrett and Floyd Vance, and there was some other explanation for the checks Jarrett had sent, it was even conceivable that he had never heard of Floyd Vance. It could be that the next thing we would hear would be Oscar, if it was Oscar, hanging up.
But it wasn’t. I didn’t time it because I was hanging on a cliff, but I think it was about three hours. I mean three minutes.
==> "You’re interrupting my dinner." I nodded at Wolfe. It was him. "Mr. Jarrett?" <==
"Yes."
"My name is Nero Wolfe. I don’t like to interrupt any man’s meal, but it’s urgent. I have a decision to make that can’t be delayed. I just now conversed with the police officer who is in charge of the investigation of the murder of Elinor Denovo, and I can tell you in confidence that Mr. Archie Goodwin, who has been to see you twice, and I are responsible for the arrest of Floyd Vance as the culprit. To justify a charge of first-degree murder the police wish to establish a motive, arid it is manifest that it would help them to have your name so they can ask you about the association of Floyd Vance and Elinor Denovo twenty- three years ago. That would inevitably lead to your appearance on the witness stand at the trial of Floyd Vance, and I am reluctant to take the responsibility for exposing a man of your standing to such an ordeal.

"Was my name mentioned in your talk with the police officer?"

 "No."

"I’ll hold the wire, but don’t keep me waiting."
I probably wasn’t breathing. It was a king-size gamble, and I was posting no odds. Too much depended on it. So the obvious step was drawing to what could be an inside straight. Not only was it possible that there was no close connection between Jarrett and Floyd Vance, and there was some other explanation for the checks Jarrett had sent, it was even conceivable that he had never heard of Floyd Vance. It could be that the next thing we would hear would be Oscar, if it was Oscar, hanging up.
But it wasn’t. I didn’t time it because I was hanging on a cliff, but I think it was about three hours. I mean three minutes.
"You’re interrupting my dinner." I nodded at Wolfe. It was him. "Mr. Jarrett?"
"Yes."
==> "My name is Nero Wolfe. I don’t like to interrupt any man’s meal, but it’s urgent. I have a decision to make that can’t be delayed. I just now conversed with the police officer who is in charge of the investigation of the murder of Elinor Denovo, and I can tell you in confidence that Mr. Archie Goodwin, who has been to see you twice, and I are responsible for the arrest of Floyd Vance as the culprit. To justify a charge of first-degree murder the police wish to establish a motive, arid it is manifest that it would help them to have your name so they can ask you about the association of Floyd Vance and Elinor Denovo twenty- three years ago. That would inevitably lead to your appearance on the witness stand at the trial of Floyd Vance, and I am reluctant to take the responsibility for exposing a man of your standing to such an ordeal. Before disclosing your name I would like to discuss the situation with you, and I’ll expect you here, at my office, at eleven o’clock tomorrow morning." <==
"Was my name mentioned in your talk with the police officer?"

 "No."
"I know nothing about the association of Floyd Vance and Elinor Denovo twenty-three years ago."
"Pfui. I’ll call Mr. McCray at once and advise him to make sure that certain checks in the files of the Seaboard Bank and Trust Company are not disturbed. If the police want them they can get a court order."

Then she should be here tomorrow morning. In the alcove. Arrange it. Make certain that she will not intrude, no matter what she hears. You know her. Perhaps Saul should come to be with her. You will see him this evening?"
"I hope to. Depending on how long it takes to get her. She’s loose now." I swung around to get the phone.
That was why I was late for poker. It was going on ten o’clock when I finally got Amy, at her apartment. Again I couldn’t tell her anything, except to be at the office at half past ten in the morning, but at least that indicated that something was stirring. I told Saul ten-thirty too. The shape New York is in, you had better allow half an hour even with a Saul Panzer if you want to be sure.

==> I LOOKED IT UP ONCE. To eavesdrop means to stand under the eaves to listen to what is said inside a house. But to listen to what is said inside Wolfe’s office you don’t stand under the eaves; you stand in the alcove, which is at the rear end of the hall, to the left as you approach the kitchen. At eye level, if you are about the height of Wolfe or me, there is a rectangular hole in the wall, seven inches high and twelve inches wide. On the alcove side of the hole there is a panel which slides open silently, and on the office side there is a trick picture of a waterfall; "trick" because through the one-way picture you can not only eaves- hear from the alcove but also eaves-see nearly all of the office. <==
In arranging for Amy Denovo, who was eight inches shorter than me, to hear and see from the alcove I could have put phone books for her to stand on, but the show might last an hour or more, and for her price of admission, of twenty grand she deserved something better than standing room. So after breakfast Friday morning I took the kitchen stepladder to the alcove, sat on it, and found that my eyes were five inches above the center of the hole. I had never measured Amy and me to determine how much of my extra eight inches was below the hips and how much was above, but I decided that would be close enough.
Amy arrived at 10:21 and Saul at 10:29. I took Amy to the alcove, had her perch on the stepladder, slid the panel open, and saw that her eyes were about right. "The size of that seat," I said, "it’s a good thing it’s your fanny and not Mr. Wolfe’s."

What is this?" she demanded.
"For you, spectator sport. You’re going to hear and see the man who sent those two hundred and sixty-four checks to your mother. Cyrus M. Jarrett is due at eleven o’clock, by appointment. We thought you ought to hear it firsthand, and with him in the red leather chair his face will be about ten feet from yours. Take a look."

She leaned to get her eyes closer to the hole. "Won’t he see me?"
"No. From that side it’s just a picture."

She leaned to get her eyes closer to the hole. "Won’t he see me?"
"No. From that side it’s just a picture."
She turned to me, "But why do ... What’s he going to say?"
"We’re waiting to hear him. Among other things he may tell us, and you, the name of your father. That may - "
The doorbell rang and I went, and it was Saul. I had told him what the program was and needed only to take him to the alcove and introduce him to the client who had paid him, through me, a little less than a grand in two weeks.
==> "Since you call me Archie," I told Amy, "you’ll have to call him Saul not to hurt his feelings. He’ll be here with you and if you get the idea that we’re not asking Jarrett the right questions and decide to come and help, Saul will block you. Jarrett must not suspect that he has any audience but Mr. Wolfe and me. Have your shoes off, and if you feel a cough or a sneeze coming, for God’s sake feel it soon enough to beat it to the kitchen." I looked at my watch. "He’s due in twenty-five minutes, but he’s driving ninety miles and he might be early. Saul will now take you to the kitchen for a coffee break. I’ll be in the office taking tranquilizers to steady my nerves." <==
"You won’t," Amy said.
"Then I won’t," I said, and left them. It would take Saul about five minutes to get acquainted with her.
There had been one big danger. A man of Jarrett’s position, financially and otherwise, might be able to put enough pressure on someone like the Police Commissioner or the Mayor or the New York Secretary of State, who issues private investigator licenses, to gag us. I blamed that fact, which had been on my

nd ever since Jarrett had hung up, for something that had happened Thursday evening, when I had let Lon Cohen rake in a fat pot without showing, though it was at least three to two that my tens would have taken it. But now, as eleven o’clock came closer and closer, that danger got slimmer and slimmer, and it looked surer and surer that Jarrett’s tie-in was so very personal that he couldn’t risk it.

==> Wolfe came down at eleven on the dot, put the daily display in the vase on his desk, sat, and went at the morning mail. I had the expense book at my desk, checking entries and additions and getting totals, on the theory that they were final totals, except for Saul today. Just a pair of private detectives starting the daily grind, yeah. The reason they weren’t holding their breath was that a man can’t hold his breath more than about two minutes, and the doorbell didn’t ring until a quarter past eleven. <==
The first two things I noticed when I opened the front door were that the car Jarrett had come in was a Heron town car, and that his eyes were exactly the same as they had been two weeks ago. I felt that I deserved a credit mark for the way I said, "Good morning." I could have made it a jab or even a jeer, but I swear it was just a cordial welcome.
He also said, "Good morning," but it wasn’t a cordial anything. It was probably merely the way he had always said good morning, and always would, to everybody from the office boy to the senior vice-president. What was different from before was his walk as he went down the hall to the office. He didn’t totter, but his steps were short and he made sure of each one before he took the next one. I waited until he had got safely lowered into the red leather chair to say, "Mr. Jarrett. Mr. Wolfe."
Jarrett said, "A footstool and a glass of water."
The only footstools in the house were in Fritz’s room in the basement. On my way to the kitchen to ask to borrow it and tell him a glass of water was wanted, a glance showed me Saul and Amy in the alcove, and her shoes were off In Fritz’s big cluttered den in the basement, with its 294 cookbooks on eleven shelves, there were three footstools, and I took the biggest one, which was topped with a tapestry with a woven hunter aiming a spear at a woven wild boar.
Back up and in the office, I found that I hadn’t missed any conversation. Jarrett

was taking a large blue pill from a little gold box, and I stood with the footstool until he had put the pill in his mouth and got it down with a swallow of water. He may have expected me to lift his feet to get the stool under, presumably Oscar would have, but I wasn’t that cordial. After he got the glass back on the stand he lifted them himself and I slid the stool under.

==> "There’s a competent doctor a few doors away," Wolfe said. <==
"No," Jarrett said. The eyes were as frozen as ever and the bony jaw as set. "I told you mornings are difficult. Talk."
Wolfe shook his head. "I will not hector a sick man. Will the pill help?"
"Damn your impudence." The bony jaw twitched. "I’m old. I’m not sick. You will not hector me, sick or well. Talk."
Wolfe’s shoulders went up a little and down. "Very well, sir, I’ll talk, but it will go faster if you accept the realities of the situation. You say I won’t hector you, but I already have. I bullied you into coming this morning, and in doing so I completely exposed my position. I made it clear that you are faced with an alternative: either you will answer my questions about certain matters, answers that will satisfy me, or I will give the police information that will move them to investigate thoroughly your relations over the years with two people - Floyd Vance and Carlotta Vaughn, later Elinor Denovo. If you are not conversant with criminal law you may not know why the police will be concerned. Floyd Vance’s lawyer, if he knows he can’t get his client acquitted, and he can’t, because of evidence supplied by Mr. Goodwin and me, will try to get a verdict of accidental homicide or second-degree murder. The police and the District Attorney will want a verdict of first-degree murder, and to get it they will need to establish a motive. You could verify this by communicating with the police or the District Attorney, but of course you can’t do that, since you don’t want the details of your connection with those two people to be disclosed. And they would inevitably be disclosed; once the police get the concrete evidence of the connection, the checks you sent to Elinor Denovo during those twenty-three years, they will uncover all the facts. That’s a task for which they are admirably equipped."
Wolfe turned a hand over and said, with no change of tone, "You had an early breakfast and a long ride. Will you have refreshment of any kind? Coffee or other drink? A sandwich, pastry, fruit? Thyme honey on corn fritters?"

"Mr. Jarrett. Don’t talk nonsense. Accept the realities. The mere mention of Floyd Vance’s name brought you to the telephone, and what I added brought you here. Pfui. Confound it, you’re not well"
It was something to see, how, in that fix, Jarrett’s eyes stayed as hard and cold as when he had told me I was an idiot. "You’re lying about McCray," he said. "He’s behind this and behind you."
"No. Only fools tell lies that are vulnerable. My sole concern is the interest of my client, Miss Amy Denovo, the daughter of Elinor Denovo."
"What do you want? How much?"
"I want nothing but answers to some questions. I want the information that my client hired me to get, that’s all - and by the way, my commitment is a limited one. I have engaged only to learn who and what her father was - and is. I will be obliged to tell her only that, and no other information you give me will be repeated to her or to anyone else, either by Mr. Goodwin or by me."
==> Wolfe cocked his head. "You spoke of blackmail. Actually, as I said yesterday, I am showing you more consideration than you deserve. A citizen who possesses information relevant to a crime is expected to give it to the police. I could have done that yesterday and saved all this pother. In their investigation they would certainly establish the identity of Amy Denovo’s father and my obligation to her would be met, and I would have earned my fee. I go to this unnecessary trouble only to gratify my self-esteem; I prefer to get the information myself, firsthand. I don’t want any thanks from you and don’t expect any." <==
"You won’t get any." Jarrett lifted his feet and kicked the footstool aside.

 Evidently the pill had helped. "I answer your questions and you earn your fee, and then you inform the police."
"No. I have told you, except for the identity of Amy Denovo’s father, nothing that you say will be reported to anyone, either by Mr. Goodwin or by me. If as assurance of that you will not accept my word there was no point in your coming."
Jarrett was visibly reacting. I admit it gave me pleasure to see it, remembering the two sessions I had had with him. His jaw was working, the muscle at the side of his neck was twitching, and his fingers had folded to make fists.

"Damn you, I’m telling you! I know because ... I have personal knowledge. That’s the information you say you have been hired to get."
"It is indeed. But as I said, I must have answers that satisfy me. We’ll start at the beginning. In the spring of nineteen forty-four Carlotta Vaughn left your employ and went to work for and with Floyd Vance. Why?"
"I reserve details not essential for your satisfaction."
"Pfui. Sir, you are a man of sense. You say you are not sick. Since you have declared your knowledge of the basic fact, it’s asinine to prolong this by trying to reserve details. The decision on what will satisfy me is for me, not you. This isn’t an agreeable conversation for either of us, and let’s make it as brief as possible. Why did she leave you and go to Floyd Vance?"
Jarrett’s jaw had stopped working and the frozen eyes were leveled at Wolfe. "I asked her to," he said. "I continued to pay her. She was very competent and I thought she would put his business on a sound basis and straighten him out. He didn’t know she came from me. He knows nothing about me. My communications to him and about him have never been direct. My sending Carlotta Vaughn to him was a mistake. When I returned from abroad in September I learned what had happened. He had attracted her and seduced her and she was pregnant. By then she had returned to her senses. She stayed on with him for a month or so, out of stubbornness, hoping to make a man of a fool,

Wolfe asked, "Does he know he is your son?"
Jarrett was set for it and wasn’t fazed. "I’ve answered that," he said. "I said he knows nothing about me. You don’t merely assume that he is my son, you conclude it, because you can conceive of no other circumstance that would account for my taking the responsibility for Carlotta Vaughn’s misfortune. To deny it would be pointless; you wouldn’t believe me. If this Amy Denovo hires you to learn more about her father I know what you’ll do, and I’ve had enough of you. His mother’s name was Florence Vance. In nineteen fourteen she was twenty and I was twenty-three. She was a waitress in a restaurant in Boston. She died five days after the child was born. No; Floyd Vance does not know I am his father. If you have a material question ask it."
"There are many I could ask," Wolfe said, "but you have covered the essential points. It is only my curiosity that would be satisfied by knowing how you got word to Floyd Vance, two weeks ago, that I was looking for Amy Denovo’s father, and I can’t insist on that. I do have a comment. If you had told Mr. Goodwin when he first called on you what you have just told me, it is extremely likely that Floyd Vance would never have been identified as the murderer of Elinor Denovo. Also Amy Denovo’s problem would have been solved and she would not have to pay me for two weeks of strenuous effort. You say you never slight a responsibility. You are clearly responsible for the added strain and expense my client has had to bear. If you send me a check in payment for the work I have done for her, I will return the retainer she gave me and charge her nothing. Should you decide to do that, the amount is fifty thousand dollars. If you do, or if you don’t, it will add to my knowledge of my fellow man. Archie, that chair is hard to rise from. Mr. Jarrett may want your arm."

He didn’t. I went, but he ignored me. He pulled his feet in, swung his torso forward in a kind of lunge, and made it. The blue pill must have had something.

 I’ll say this for him, he never wasted words. No other man I had ever met would have simply let Wolfe’s comments ride, but he did. That was the third time I saw him make an abrupt exit, and the big difference was that the first two times the exit line had been his. Walking out, his step was surer than it had been coming in. I got to the hall ahead of him, and to the front door. When he appeared on the stoop the chauffeur opened the door of the Heron and crossed the sidewalk and started up, but Jarrett shook his head and made it down alone, and the chauffeur didn’t offer to help him in. Evidently he knew the signs.

Saul slid the panel shut. Amy, leaving the stool, misjudged the distance to the floor and landed off balance. I took her arm, and she said, "Thank you," politely. Her cheeks had less color than usual.

The door opened and two women entered and headed for the elevator. That was
not the place to discuss very personal matters.
She was all right to walk with, no leading or lagging and no silly step-stretching. At that time of day in August there was plenty of room in the back at The Cooler, and we got the corner table where Lily and I had often had a snack. When the waitress had taken our order and left, I asked if she wanted to put off being personal until we had something inside.
She shook her head. "I might as well ..." She let it hang ten seconds and then blurted, "I want you to find my father."
I raised a brow. "Have you lost him?"
==> "No. I haven’t lost him ... because I never had him." She said it fast, as if someone was trying to stop her. "I decided I had to tell somebody - that was a month ago - and then I got this job with Miss Rowan and I found out that she knows you, and I met you, and of course I know about you and Nero Wolfe. But I don’t want Nero Wolfe to do it, I want you to." <==
There were no dimples, and the quick brown eyes were fastened on me.
"That won’t work," I told her. "I’m on full time with Mr. Wolfe, twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week when they’re needed, and I don’t take jobs on my own. But I have a loose hour" - I looked at my watch - "and twenty minutes, and if you want a suggestion I might possibly have one. No charge."
"But I need more than a suggestion."
"You’re not in a position to judge. You’re too involved."

"There must be. Everyone has relatives."
"No. None. Of course there might be some under her real name."
"Have you got any? Cousins, uncles, aunts ..."

 "No."
==> It was getting messy. Or rather, it was getting too damn pure and simple. I knew people who liked to think of themselves as loners, but Amy Denovo really was one; with her it wasn’t just thinking. I suggested that we might try the sandwiches, and she agreed and took one, and took a bite. Naturally, when I am eating with someone, male or female, for the first time, I notice the details of his or her performance, since it tells a lot about the person, but that time I didn’t because the way she took a bite, or chewed, or swallowed, or licked her lips, had no bearing on the fix she was in. I did observe that there was nothing wrong with her appetite, and she proved that she liked the egg-and-anchovy combo by taking her full share. She asked if it was on Nero Wolfe’s list of favorites, and I said no, he would probably sneer at it. When the platter was empty she said she hadn’t thought it would make her hungry, telling someone the secret she had kept bottled up so long, but it had. She gave me a little smile, the dimples coming, and said, "We don’t really know ourselves, do we?" <==
"It depends," I said. "Some of us know too much, and some not enough. I don’t want to know why I get out of bed mornings in a fog, I might never sleep again. To hell with it, I always find my way out. As for you, you’re not in a fog, you’re under a spotlight that you turned on yourself. Why don’t you just turn it off?"
"I did not turn it on myself Other people did it, especially my mother. I can’t turn it off."
"Well, then. What’s your biggest question? Your mother’s real name and so on, or your father?"
"My father, of course. After all, I have lived with my mother all my life, and I suppose my wanting to know her real name and things about her is just ... well, curiosity. But I must know about my father. Is he alive? Who is he? What is he? His genes made me!"
I nodded. "Yeah, you went to Smith. You learned too much about genes. Mr. Wolfe said once that scientists should keep their findings strictly to themselves; by spilling it they just complicate things for other people. Would you like some coffee?"

"They have good sweet things."
She shook her head. "I admit I could eat anything, it’s really amazing, my being so hungry, but I’d rather not. What do you ...? You said you might have a suggestion."
"I know I did." I turned a hand over on the table. "You’ve got a tough one. I’m afraid you need more than a suggestion, even from the one man you can trust. Sure, I filed that. To get what you want - there’s one chance in a million that a week or so of poking around would crack it, but it would probably be a long and very expensive job. How much money have you got?"
"Not much. Of course I would want to pay you."
==> "Not me. I explained that. But Nero Wolfe has inflated ideas about fees; that’s why I would have to know exactly how you are fixed. If you care to tell me." <==
"Certainly I’ll tell you. I have never earned any money, not enough to mention, and anyway I’ve spent it. I only have what my mother left, after paying the ... for the cremation. She left instructions about that. There’s a little more than two thousand dollars in the bank, that’s all. There are no debts and I don’t owe anyone anything."
I had a brow up. "What did your mother do for - no, that’s immaterial. She made enough to send you to an expensive college. Unless someone helped?"
"No. She did it all. You were going to ask what she did for a living. She was with a television producer, the same one from as far back as I can remember. I suppose she got fifteen thousand a year, maybe more. She never told me." The quick brown eyes were straight at me. "If I paid Nero Wolfe the two thousand dollars he would have you work on it, wouldn’t he?"
I shook my head. "He wouldn’t even discuss it. He would know it might take a year, and he thinks nothing of billing a client five grand for a one-week job. You said you know about him, but apparently you don’t. He’s pigheaded and high- nosed and toplofty, and he thinks he’s the best detective in the world, and so do I, or I would have moved out long ago. I think you deserve some help with your problem, and you certainly need it, and I like your dimples, but if I told him about you and suggested an appointment he would just glare at me. He would

 sugar and egg yolks and sherry and almond extract, and went across to the office, where he got at his desk with the mail, and I got at mine with the plant records to enter the items he had talked Lewis Hewitt out of.
At four o’clock, when he took the elevator to the roof for his regular two-hour afternoon session with Theodore and the orchids, I took the stairs for the two flights to my room to do some little personal chores, like inspecting socks and changing the ribbon on my personal typewriter. Those operations always take longer than you expect, and when I heard the doorbell, which has a connection to my room, and glanced at my wrist, I was surprised to see that it was twenty to six. I left it to Fritz, who goes when I am not downstairs, but in a couple of minutes the house phone buzzed, and when I got it Fritz said that a young woman who said her name was Denovo wanted to see me, and I asked him to put her in the front room.
When, after mounting the stoop of the old brownstone, you enter, the second door down the hall on your left is the office. The first is to what we call the front room, which isn’t used much, mostly for parking people who aren’t wanted in the office. Its furniture is nothing much, not like the office or the kitchen, because Wolfe is seldom in it and doesn’t give a damn. When I entered, Amy Denovo was on a chair by a window. She stood up and said, "Well, here I am."
"So I see." I crossed to her. "It’s nice to see you and I don’t want to be rude, but I thought I made it clear yesterday."
==> "Oh, you made it clear enough." She started a smile but it didn’t quite come. "But I decided I had to see you again, and see Nero Wolfe, I suppose, and so I ... I did something." She had her bag, brown leather with a big clasp, under her left arm. She sat down and opened it, and took out a parcel wrapped in newspaper with rubber bands around it. She held it out and I took it, not wanting to be rude. "That’s twenty thousand dollars," she said, "in hundred-dollar bills." Now the smile came. "You would call it twenty grand. Of course you’ll want to count it." <==
No suitable words seemed to be ready for the tongue, so I gave them time by removing the rubber bands and unfolding the newspaper for a look. It was centuries, some new and some used, in batches fastened with paper clips, and they looked real when I flipped through some. There were ten in the batch I counted, and there were twenty batches. I rewrapped them in the newspaper and replaced the rubber bands.

"At five grand a week," she said, "that’s enough for four weeks anyway."
From the hall the sound came of the elevator rattling to a stop. Wolfe was down from the plant rooms.
"The five grand was just the fee," I said. "It didn’t include expenses. But that was a little special, it isn’t always five grand a week. Are you telling me that you want to hire Nero Wolfe and you offer this as a retainer?"

"Yes. Certainly. Provided you’re in charge."
"He’s always in charge. I merely do the work."
"All right, if you do the work."
"I will. He only does the thinking. I’ll explain it to him and then call you in. If you’ll wait here?"
She frowned and shook her head. "I don’t want to talk about it to anybody but you."

By the time the Gazette went to press on Thursday, June first, the date of the last clipping, the police had got nowhere. They didn’t even claim that anyone had been invited in for questioning, let alone name a suspect; they only said that the investigation was being vigorously pursued, which was probably true, since they hate a hit-and-run and don’t quit until it’s absolutely hopeless, and even then they don’t forget it.
There was nothing about Elinor Denovo that I didn’t already know, except that she was vice-president of Raymond Thorne Productions, Inc. Miss Amy Denovo had been interviewed but hadn’t said much. Raymond Thorne had said that Mrs. Denovo had made valuable contributions to the art of television production and her death was a great loss not only for his company but for the whole television industry and therefore for the country. I thought he should make up his mind whether television was an art or an industry.
I put the file on Lon’s desk, waited until he had finished at a phone, and said, "Many thanks. I was curious about a detail. The latest item is June first. Would

 you know if there has been any progress since?"
==> He got at a phone, the green one this time, pressed a button, and in a moment talked, and then waited. While he waited another phone buzzed, and stopped when he pushed a button. In a couple of minutes he told the green phone, "Yeah, sure." In another couple of minutes he cradled it, turned to me and said, "Apparently it’s dead. Our last word, more than a month ago, was that we might as well cross it off. They had only one man still on it. But now of course, with Nero Wolfe horning in, it’s far from dead. So it was murder. I don’t expect you to name him, even off the record, but I want enough for a page one box." <==
I was on my feet. "Journalists," I said, "are the salt and pepper of the earth. I would enjoy discussing that with you, but I’m on my way to a rustic swimming pool in the middle of a tailor-made glade in the Westchester woods, and I’m twenty hours late. I said it was something trivial, but have it your way. Yes, it was murder, and the driver of the car was the skunk who topped my three aces with four deuces Thursday night. I hope they get him."
I turned and went.
But down in the lobby I went to a phone booth, dialed a number I didn’t have to look up, gave my name, asked if Sergeant Stebbins was around, and after a long wait got his voice:
"Stebbins. Something up, Archie?"
He must have just won a bet or got a raise. He called me Archie only about once in two years, and sometimes he wouldn’t even say Goodwin but made it just you. I returned the compliment. "Nothing with a bite, Purley, just a routine question, but to answer it you may have to look at a file. You may have forgotten it, it was nearly three months ago - a hit-and-run on East Eighty-third Street, a woman named Elinor Denovo - "

"Yes?"
"Me in a hurry. Cramer was here just now, stopping on his way downtown. I
haven’t had a chance to tell you that Saturday afternoon I rang Stebbins and - " "I’m busy!" he bellowed and hung up.
I assumed he had just found a thrip on a favorite plant or dry rot on a pseudobulb, but as I said, I do not like to be bellowed at. If Cramer called they could discuss crime. When the letters were in the envelopes and in my pocket I still had a chore left, ringing Mortimer M. Hotchkiss, the vice-president who bossed the Thirty-fourth Street branch of the Continental Bank and Trust Company. That didn’t take long; he was always glad to be of service to a

==>  depositor - not me, Nero Wolfe - whose balance never went below five figures and sometimes hit six. That done, I got the box from the safe and was off. Nothing was in it but the money; the letter was on a shelf with some other classified items. <==
At the Eighty-sixth Street branch I found that Hotchkiss had been prompt. I was only six steps inside when a man at a desk got up and motioned me over and asked if I was Mr. Goodwin, and then took me inside the rail and along an aisle to a door at the front. He opened it and bowed me in, and there was Amy Denovo on a chair facing a big glass-topped desk. Behind the desk was a middle-aged banker with a shiny dome and rimless cheaters. As I crossed he rose and offered a hand, saying that it was a pleasure, Mr. Goodwin, a real pleasure, which was par, since Hotchkiss was a vice-president and he wasn’t. I said, "Mr. Atwood?" and he said yes and told me to sit, but after telling Amy good morning I put the box on the desk, fished the key from my pocket and used it, and opened the lid wide. Then I sat Atwood had started to, but was up again, staring at the contents of the box. It rated a stare, even from a banker.
"That belongs to Miss Denovo," I said. "I assume that Mr. Hotchkiss told you that I work for Nero Wolfe. Miss Denovo has engaged Mr. Wolfe’s services, and I’m here for her. That’s two hundred and forty-four thousand dollars, all in centuries. Miss Denovo would like to have twelve bank checks for twenty grand each, payable to her, and the remaining four grand deposited in her account."
"Certainly," he said. He looked at her and back at me. "That’s quite a ... quite a ... certainly. Do you want ... it will take a while, a little while - counting it and making out the checks."
I nodded. "Sure. Certainly. Anyway, if you’re not too busy, we’d like to discuss something with you."
"Cer - I’ll be glad to, Mr. Goodwin." His hand started for the phone on the desk, but he changed his mind. He closed the lid of the box, tucked it under his arm, said he would be back soon, and went.

When the door was shut Amy asked, "What’s he going to do?"
"His duty," I said. "The slogan of this bank is: THE BANK YOU CAN BANK ON. You have crossed and uncrossed your ankles three times. Relax."

THE OFFICE OF Raymond Thorne Productions was on the sixth floor of one of the newer steel-and-glass hives on Madison Avenue in the Forties. Judging from its size, and the furniture and fixtures, and the cordial smile of the receptionist, the television art, or maybe industry, was doing fine. Also I had to wait twenty minutes to get in to Thorne, though he had told Amy on the phone that his door would always be open for her or anyone she sent.
Of course I wasn’t suspecting that he might himself be the target. In her letter Elinor had told Amy that she hadn’t seen or heard from her father since four months before she was born, and there was no reason to suppose that that might be flam and she had seen him every work day for twenty years. The idea that a detective should suspect everything that everybody says is a good general rule, but there’s a limit.
Thorne and his room went together fine. The room was big and modern and so was he. After giving me a man-to-man handshake and saying how much he would like to help Amy any way he could, and telling me to sit, he returned to

 his desk and said he didn’t know what it was I wanted because Amy had been rather vague on the phone.
==> I nodded. "She thought I could tell it better, but it’s really very simple. She wants Nero Wolfe - you may have heard the name." <==
"Oh, sure."
"She wants him to find out who killed her mother. I think she’s a little hipped on it, but that’s her privilege. She thinks the cops should have nailed him long ago, and also she thinks they went at it wrong. She thinks it was premeditated murder. In fact, she’s sure it was. Don’t ask me why she’s sure; I have asked her, and she says it’s intuition. How old were you when you learned not to argue with intuition?"
"It’s so long ago I’ve forgotten."
"Me too. But intuition hasn’t told her who it was. She has made a list of names, twenty-eight of them, people who were friends of her mother, everybody who had personal contact that could be called close even by stretching it, and she has said no to all of them. She says none of them could possibly have had a reason, so it must have been someone she doesn’t know about - someone connected with her work here, or someone from many years ago when she was too young to remember. Therefore I come to you first, naturally. She worked here, and you knew her - how long?"
"More than twenty years." He had his head cocked. "Do you think it was premeditated murder?"

I wasn’t feeling any better as I drove back to town Sunday evening. The weekend had been messy. There is never more than one house guest besides me; it may be anybody from a female poet to a cowboy from the Montana ranch Lily owns; and that time it was Amy Denovo. She gave it a good start only an hour after I arrived. She called me Archie. We were on the terrace. I had finished off the steak Mimi had broiled - they had eaten - and was forking the blueberry pie when Amy got out a cigarette and I lit it, and she said, "Thank you, Archie." Of course Lily didn’t bat an eye; she wouldn’t. But as far as she knew Amy had seen me only three times for a total of about nine minutes, and she didn’t have to be a cluster of vagaries to wonder what the score was. Was Amy just being flip, or had I decided to see more of her, not at the penthouse, and taken steps? I couldn’t tell her what Miss Denovo had hired Wolfe to do, so I skipped it. But it was there in the air. Between Lily and me it was thoroughly understood that what I did was none of her business unless it touched her - and, naturally, vice versa - but the fact that I had met Miss Denovo at the penthouse put it on the borderline. So it didn’t help the weekend.
A couple of other things didn’t help either. One of the five guests for lunch Saturday was a woman with a green wig who had positive inside information

 that President Johnson and Dean Rusk had decided three years ago to kill everybody in China with hydrogen bombs, and that was the real reason for what they were doing in Vietnam.
Of course the only thing to do with such a clunk is to ignore him or her, but she kept it up so loud and long that I finally told her that I had positive inside information that Senator Fulbright had once had an affair with one of Ho Chi Minh’s concubines, and that was the real reason he wanted the bombing stopped. That was a mistake. The idea appealed to her and she wanted all the details.
==> And Sunday afternoon some uninvited people dropped in - a couple I had met there before who had a place over beyond Bedford Village. They weren’t so bad, but they had a guy with them who they said had talked them into coming because he wanted to meet me. His name was Floyd Vance and he said he was a public-relations counselor. Evidently he wanted to meet me because he wanted to meet Nero Wolfe. He was drumming up trade. He said that if anybody needed expert handling of his public image a private detective did, and he would like very much to create a presentation to propose to Nero Wolfe. He also said that if we were working on a case and I would tell him about it, he could use that as a basis for the presentation. When he said that I sharpened my eyes and ears a little, and my tongue, thinking he might be making a stab at detective work himself for somebody, for instance Cyrus M. Jarrett, but decided he was just another character who was so dedicated to improving other people’s images that he had no time left for his own. I met one once who - no, that’s enough for that weekend. <==
So as I said, I wasn’t feeling any better as I drove back to town. Sometimes it’s things that take the joy out of life, like a blowout when you’re hitting sixty or a button coming off of a shirt when you’re in a hurry, but usually it’s people. Of course, of the three people who had made that weekend less than perfect Amy was the only one whose contribution would carry over. Lily would do some wondering for a week or so - who wouldn’t? - but I certainly wasn’t going to explain. When two people who want to get along start needing to have things explained, look out. I would tell the client about her mother’s real name when I felt like it.

THE TROUBLE WITH PUTTING a box number on an ad instead of your name and address and phone number, especially if it’s in three papers, is getting the replies. Phoning at ten o’clock Monday morning and learning that there were some, I went for them, got two at the Times and four at the Gazette, opened them there, and found them so screwy that I bothered to take them home only because I always keep everything connected with a job until it’s finished. One was from a man who said Carlotta Vaughn was his grandmother, and maybe a Carlotta Vaughn was, but he didn’t mention Elinor Denovo.
When I got back a little after eleven Fritz said there had been no calls, but as I entered the office the phone rang and I crossed to my desk, nodding to Wolfe on the way, and got it.

==> "Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie Goodwin speaking." <==
Female voice: "Good morning. Mr. Jarrett would like to speak to Mr. Wolfe." "Good morning. Please put Mr. Jarrett on."
"Is Mr. Wolfe there?"
"Yes."
"Please put him on."
"Now listen." I motioned to Wolfe. "Last Friday I got Mr. McCray for Mr. Wolfe and I was forced to put Mr. Wolfe on first You can’t have it coming and going. Put Mr. Jarrett on or I hang up."

"May I have your name, please?"
"Archie Goodwin."
"Please hold the wire, Mr. Goodwin."
==> I timed it: two minutes and twenty seconds. Wolfe bad his phone. "Eugene Jarrett speaking. Nero Wolfe?" <==
Me: "Please hold the wire, Mr. Jarrett."
Wolfe should have waited at least a minute, but he hates the phone, either

 holding or talking. "This is Nero Wolfe. Yes, Mr. Jarrett?"
"I have your letter. I’ll come around six."

"I have your letter. I’ll come around six."
"Good. As I said in the letter, I’ll appreciate it. I’ll expect you."
They hung up together. There was a case where the approach took five minutes and the meet about ten seconds. A piece by a scientist in the Sunday New York Times Magazine which I had read during the weekend had explained why this is the age of instant communication.
There were some items in the morning mail that needed attention, or at least got it, but we were interrupted a few times by phone calls: from Saul, who had drawn nothing but blanks; from Fred, who had found three people who had recognized the photographs but hadn’t been any help; and from Orrie, from Washington, who had verified most of Jarrett’s places and dates and was working on the rest. The hospital part, which covered most of July, was airtight. You are probably thinking that the client was getting damned little for her money, and I agree. When I returned from a trip to the mailbox at the corner it was lunchtime, and as we crossed to the dining room Wolfe said something about Mr. Cramer and I asked if he had phoned. Wolfe said no, he had come, late Saturday afternoon.
I was sorry I had missed it because talk by those two is always worth hearing. You get good examples of how much a man can say in a few words and also of how little he can say in a lot of words. So back in the office after lunch I said I would just as soon know what Cramer had wanted, and Wolfe said only what he always wanted, information; he had said nothing that would help us any.

Miss Rowan does sometimes and she likes that one. As you see, I am no longer on daylight saving. Apparently you are." He was fully dressed: a nice clean yellow shirt with narrow maroon stripes, a maroon tie, and a brown summerweight self-striped suit. Up in the plant rooms he would shed the jacket and put on a smock.
He swallowed a bite of egg and said, "It’s nearly nine o’clock."
"By daylight saving, yes, sir. I’ll brief them while I’m eating breakfast."
"Only Saul. We won’t risk it with Fred and Orrie. Tell them to be on call. You and Saul will decide on your approach and you may need them later. First, is he involved? If yes, merely as the murderer, with a motive that doesn’t concern us, or also as the father? We can’t waste our time and the client’s money just on finding a culprit for Mr. Cramer." He dropped toast in the sauce.
==> "I’m waking up," I said. "Or I got ideas in my sleep. Last night I said we don’t have to answer the question how he knew we were on it, but if he’s the father it may be important. If he’s the father there’s some connection between him and Cyrus Jarrett, or why did Jarrett send the checks? And if Jarrett told him that Nero Wolfe is out to find the father, and if he is also the murderer, what about Miss Denovo? We might lose a client. I doubt if you want another casualty like Simon Jacobs on the record, and I certainly don’t. I suggest that we’d better get her out of circulation." <==
He made a face. "Fritz."
That was what he calls flummery. It was true that when, for security reasons, it had been necessary to have a female guest sleeping and eating in the South Room, which is above Wolfe’s, Fritz hadn’t been able to hide how he felt about it, but Wolfe hadn’t even tried to hide how he felt.
"I’m aware," I said, "that if we did it again Fritz might leave and you might too. I don’t mean here. She spends most of her days at Miss Rowan’s, and she could spend her nights there too until we get him or drop him. Miss Rowan has two spare rooms. I’ll suggest it. Anything else?"
He said no and I went back up a flight to do in ten minutes what usually takes me thirty. By the time I got down to the kitchen, having stopped in the office to tell Fred and Orrie that Saul and I were going to pick up a trail and might need them later, my fog was starting to clear.

"That’s a good way to put it. I am certainly not prepared. Give the genius my regards."
He meant it, but he knew I knew exactly what he would put in a long footnote. I dialed another familiar number to make another request and then went up to my room for a quick shave and change. The ten minutes before breakfast hadn’t been enough.

t was too hot to walk the more than two miles to East Sixty-third Street, and anyway I had told Lily I would be there by eleven-thirty. It was five minutes short of that when I pushed the button at the penthouse door and got a mild surprise when Mimi opened it. When I am expected at a certain hour it’s nearly always Lily who comes, I think on account of some kind of a notion she has about a maid admitting a man who has a key. I have never tried to dope it. Other people’s notions are none of my business unless they get in the way. Then I got a second mild surprise. I had told Lily on the phone that I wanted to see both her and Miss Denovo, but even so, why were they out on the terrace at that hour with a pitcher of iced tea when they should have been inside working? The penthouse was air-conditioned. Was Lily actually still ... To hell with it. I was working. I moved another chair over, between them, sat, accepted an offer of tea with lime and mint, and said, "Don’t mind my manners, I have a busy day ahead." I turned to Lily. "We’re working on a problem for Miss Denovo. We’ve been on it - "
"Archie! No."
==> That was an example of a client’s notion getting in the way. "I’m talking," I told her distinctly and returned to Lily. "It’s very personal and she doesn’t want anyone to know about it, not even you, and I’m proud and happy that she trusts me so much that she calls me Archie, so about her problem I’ll only say that she is not responsible for it. Other people created it; she merely wants to solve it. She came to see Nero Wolfe two weeks ago today." <==
"Why do you - " Amy started, and stopped.
Lily was smiling at me. "Ole, Escamillo," she said, and put a kiss on a fingertip and flipped it to me.
"Last night," I told Amy, "there was a development. With Miss Rowan here I can’t give you the details, and I wouldn’t anyhow at this stage. But it is now more than a wild guess that your mother’s death wasn’t just an accidental hit- and-run, that it was deliberate murder, and if so it’s possible that he has ideas about you. We don’t know - "
"He? Who?"

That wasn’t dumb; it was merely desperate. Of course the obvious place to look for someone to ask about the tenants and frequenters of that building in 1944 was the building itself, but Saul and I had pretty well covered that Friday afternoon. There was no elevator man or other service man who had been there more-than four years except the building superintendent. He had got the job in 1961, soon after the building had been acquired by its present owner, and he told Saul his predecessor had been there only five years. He didn’t even know the name of the former owner or agent. He did know that none of the present tenants had been there as long as twenty-three years. At the Third Avenue office of the East and West Realty Corporation, the current agent, the only personnel on duty Saturday morning were a girl whose mother should have made her wear teeth braces and an old man with a glass eye who didn’t even know the name of the

 previous owner or agent.
I accomplished something else on Sunday. I took Lily Rowan and Amy Denovo to a double-header at Shea Stadium, and got the client back to the penthouse safe and sound.
Monday morning a sunburned woman at the East and West Realty Corporation gave us the name of the previous agent, Kauffman Management Company, and at their office on Forty-second Street we were lucky enough to find a smart and active young man who believed in giving service. He spent half an hour looking up old records. The man who had been the superintendent at Ten East Thirty- ninth Street in 1944, named William Polk, had died in 1962. There was no record of the names of any of the service personnel, but there was a complete list of the 1944 tenants - twenty-two of them, counting Floyd Vance - and we copied it. The smart young man said there was no one active in the Kauffman Management Company who had been there for twenty-three years. Bernard Kauffman, who had founded it, was dead.
==> Saul and I each took half of the list of tenants and went to work on them. I could make a full report on the first four I tackled, but this is not a treatise on economics or sociology. It was the fifth one that rang the gong, a little before five o’clock in the afternoon - a woman named Dorothy Sebor, fifty, gray-haired and blue-eyed and fully as smart as the young man at the Kauffman Management Company - who beaded and probably owned the Sebor Shopping Service in a tenth-floor suite at Rockefeller Center. She was busy. The forty minutes I spent with her wouldn’t have been more than half that if the phone hadn’t interrupted several times, and I might have had a problem getting to her if I hadn’t sent in word that I wanted to ask her something about Ten East Thirty- ninth Street. When I entered her room she asked if I was the Archie Goodwin who worked for Nero Wolfe, and when I said yes she asked, "But what can I possibly tell you about Ten East Thirty-ninth Street? I left eighteen years ago. I loved that dump. Sit down." <==
I sat. "I don’t know what you can tell me, Miss Sebor, but I know what I want to ask. A job we’re on goes back pretty far and it’s nineteen forty-four we’re interested in. Would you mind telling me what floor you were on?"
"No, why should I? The ninth. In the rear."
"We understand that another of the tenants was named Floyd Vance. Did you

 know him?"

"I don’t know about every day. But most of the time, yes, she was there. He was in public relations. I don’t know if he still is, I know nothing about him. He left Number Ten - I think it was two years after Carlotta left."
"I have the impression that your liking for Carlotta didn’t extend to him,"
"It didn’t. I didn’t know him, really, and I didn’t want to. He thought he was handsome and charming, and perhaps he was, but I thought he was - well, flashy. Not the kind of man I would work either for or with. And if you - good lord, is he your client?"
"He is not. I doubt if there are many men of any kind you would work for or with."
==> She smiled, more with her mouth than her eyes. "I’ve never tried and don’t intend to. I wouldn’t mind having a man of your kind working for me. How much does Nero Wolfe pay you?" <==
"Nothing. I work for love of the job. I meet interesting people like you. If I get fed up and quit I’ll come and remind you. Speaking of quitting, do you suppose Carlotta quit Vance because her opinion of him was about the same as yours? She might have said - "
The phone again - an important customer, judging from the conversation - and then she made calls to two employees, giving one of them detailed instructions and the other one hell. As she hung up she looked at her watch. "It’s getting late," she said, "and I have a pile of work."
"So have I, thanks to you." I rose to my feet. "Do you suppose your opinion of Vance rubbed off on Carlotta?"
"I doubt it. If it did she wouldn’t have told me. She was very ... self-contained." "Do you shake hands with men?"
She laughed - a good healthy laugh. "Occasionally. If I want them to do something."

I got my feet to the floor, no hurry, straightened up, and bent over to put my shoes on. When I am doing desk work the door to the hall and most of the room are behind me, and on the wall back of my desk is a mirror five feet wide and four feet high, for keeping an eye on people. I used it to put my tie on, combed my hair with my fingers, swiveled, and said, "I don’t suppose you’ll ever want the painful details of what led up to it, but if you do I’ll be glad to oblige. An hour and a half ago a woman named Dorothy Sebor who runs, repeat runs, a shopping service in Rockefeller Center, said to me, ‘But what can I possibly tell you about Ten East Thirty-ninth Street? I left there eighteen years ago. I loved that dump. Sit down.’ If you don’t mind I’ll use my formula, not yours. I prefer ‘I’ and ‘she’ to ‘Goodwin’ and ‘Sebor.’"


I gave it to him verbatim, with him, as always, leaning back with his eyes closed. When I finished he sat for a full minute, no movement, and then moved only his lips to mutter, "Very satisfactory."
"It was about time," I said with feeling. "Questions." His eyes opened. "Why roses?"
==> I nodded. "I expected that. It came out without thinking, probably because she had struck me as not the type for orchids. She could probably get a lot more for Nero Wolfe orchids than for run-of-the-nursery roses." <==
"We’ll send her some sprays of Phalaenopsis Aphrodite. They have never been finer. Having had time to consider it, you regard the job as finished?"
"I was just smacking my lips after so many hungry days. One will get you fifty that Floyd Vance is the father, but I admit it wouldn’t be enough for a jury. It might be enough for the client, but I also admit there are other angles."
"Specify them."
"Well. The angle most important to us is your honor. Four days ago I said to Cramer, ‘I am authorized to give you Mr. Wolfe’s word of honor that if we get anything you might be able to use we’ll pass it on to you before we make any use of it ourselves.’ I added, ‘At least two minutes before,’ but that didn’t cancel the commitment. We now have these items: One: Carlotta Vaughn became pregnant in the summer of nineteen forty-four and almost certainly wasn’t married. Two: she spent the entire summer of nineteen forty-four in close association with Floyd Vance. Three: on Monday, May twenty-second, nineteen sixty-seven, four days before Carlotta Vaughn, who was then Elinor Denovo, died, Floyd Vance tried to see her and was chased by the receptionist, and he had been trying to see her before. I’d hate to undertake to tell Cramer that those three items, taken together, are not something he might be able to use. Of course your honor is your lookout, but I mortgaged it."
He grunted. "My lookout and my responsibility. Go on."

I expected him to start the lip act, but he merely cocked his head. "The point," he said, "is that we don’t know which of two alternative situations faces us. If he is the father but not a murderer, establishing it will be difficult if not impossible. He did that many years ago. But if he is also a murderer the situation is much simpler; he did that only three months ago. We’ll resolve that and then decide how to proceed. Can you get him here this evening?"
"For what? Do I ask him if he still wants to meet you?"
"That would do to start. If he says no, tell him I want to meet him. Tell him I want to ask him why he didn’t reply to the advertisement requesting information about Carlotta Vaughn, alias Elinor Denovo."
I had noted the listing of Vance’s home phone, but got the directory to check on the number, and found that my memory had it right. It was a quarter to seven when I dialed, and if he ate out I would probably get no answer. But after two rings I got a hello.
"Mr. Floyd Vance, please?" "I’m Floyd Vance."
==> "I’m Archie Goodwin. I work for Nero Wolfe. You may remember that we met at Lily Rowan’s place, and you - " <==
"I remember."
"And you said you would like to meet Nero Wolfe to make a proposal. I reminded Mr. Wolfe of that just now when we were discussing something, and he decided he would also like to meet you. Could you come this evening, say at nine o’clock?"

Silence. Five seconds. "This is short notice."
"I know. It’s not as urgent as a five-alarm fire, but if it’s not too inconvenient... the address is - "

 glad to see them that I swung the door wide, and I was probably showing my teeth in a big grin of welcome. If so, it soon went. They came in fast, Stebbins’ shoulder jostling me as he passed, headed for the rear, and started up the stairs.
A cop inside the house is a very different problem from one outside. Once he’s inside legally, and I had opened the door, about all you can do is sit down and write a letter to the Supreme Court. Even if I could beat them to the plant rooms, and I couldn’t, since the elevator was up there, what good would it do? I went to the kitchen to tell Fritz what had happened and that I was going up to join the party, and then took my time mounting the three flights.
To go through those three rooms, the cool, the moderate, and the warm, down the aisles between the benches, without being stopped by a color or a shape that you didn’t know existed, your mind must be fully occupied with something else. That time mine was. In the middle room I could already hear a voice, and when I opened the door to the warm room I could name it. Cramer. I walked the aisle and opened the door to the potting room, and there they were. Wolfe, in a yellow smock, was on his stool at the big bench. Theodore was standing over by the pot racks. Stebbins was off to the right. Cramer, in the center of the room, had his felt hat off and in his hand, I don’t know why. Facing Wolfe, he was telling him, louder than necessary, "...and hold you as material witnesses until we get warrants and then, by God, you go to a cell. All right, talk or move."
Wolfe stayed on the stool. His eyes came to me. "Any complaint, Archie?" "Only their bad manners. Next time they’ll talk through a crack."
==> His eyes moved. "Mr. Cramer. As I said, I will not talk business in this room. Not a word. If you’ll wait in my office I’ll be down at eleven o’clock. If you put hands on me, and Mr. Goodwin, and take us elsewhere, we’ll stand mute and communicate with our lawyer. When he comes we’ll confer with him privately, and the afternoon paper, the Gazette, and tomorrow morning’s papers, will publish the news that Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin have discovered the identity of the murderer of Elinor Denovo and have delivered satisfactory evidence to the police. Also, that in recognition of that public service they have been arrested and are behind bars, and their lawyer is arranging to secure their release on bail. Archie, here, please. This Miltonia charlesworthi germination card has conflicting entries. We’ll have to check it." <==
I went and took the card and scowled at it.


Cramer was in a box. My taking him the contents of those cartons and the letter, if the prints matched, certainly made us material witnesses, but if he herded us downtown and we performed as programmed by Wolfe, and we would, he would have to plug his ears for the horse laughs. If he and Stebbins waited there to go down to the office with us there was nowhere to sit, and standing around waiting may be all right for a sergeant but not for an inspector.
Stebbins muttered, apparently to himself, "God, I’d love to knock him off that stool." He looked at Cramer. "We take ‘em down and lock ‘em up and kick ‘em out before the lawyer comes."

I DIDN’T KNOW THEN, and I still don’t, exactly how long it took the city employees to find out why Floyd Vance killed Elinor Denovo. I mean really wrap it up. All I know is that Cramer’s phone call didn’t come until 6:38 p.m. Thursday, just in time to make me late at the poker party again. And I still didn’t know what the obvious step was. One of the eighty-seven facts about Wolfe that I would change if I knew how is that he doesn’t believe in talking merely to satisfy anyone’s curiosity, even mine. I admit that in this case there might have been other factors - for instance, he might have wanted to see if I would dope it out for myself and make some suggestions. You probably have, but maybe you wouldn’t if you had been in my shoes, waiting for a development which depended entirely on other people, and you didn’t know what they were doing and not doing.
I did do one thing. When I learned from the noon news broadcast on Wednesday that Floyd Vance was being held without bail, and rang Lon Cohen to check it, I phoned Lily Rowan to say I wanted to see the client and was invited to lunch; and after we had finished the lobster salad and cantaloupe mousse and had gone out’ to the terrace, I told Amy that there was no more danger of her being a special target and if she went out for a walk her chances of getting back in one

iece were as good as anybody else’s. Naturally she wanted to know what had happened, and Lily did too, and I think that was the first and only time that Lily suspected me of putting on an act in connection with my work. She remembered that she had a date, some kind of a committee meeting, which I doubted, and left me there with Amy. I admit she thought she was being considerate, but it was no favor to me. I had been stalling Amy for two weeks and she wanted to know, and I couldn’t blame her. Usually you can tell a client something, but I had already told her that her mother’s name was Carlotta Vaughn, and there was absolutely nothing that I was ready to add. When I left I wasn’t at all sure that I was still the one man in the world she could trust.
==> Of course I read every word in the Wednesday and Thursday papers about the hit-and-run driver the police had nabbed after three months, but learned nothing about motive. I got the impression that the fingerprints which had identified him had been secured by extremely competent detective work by the Homicide Bureau, but there were no published details about it. There was no mention of Nero Wolfe or Archie Goodwin. There was a lot of new information, new to me, about Floyd Vance, and one item cleared up a point that I had wondered about. In 1944 he had been in his late twenties and single, and why hadn’t he been sent, either to Europe or to Asia, to help several million of his fellow citizens do some expert handling of the public image of the United States of America? According to Wednesday’s Gazette and News, and Thursday’s Times, he had been excused because he had some kind of a trick knee. Other items, though they cleared up nothing, told me more about him - for instance, that he had always been a tadpole in a big frog pond as a public-relations counselor. Evidently he had had very little effect on the dignity of man, either way. <==
When the phone rang at 6:38 p.m. Thursday, I was at my desk working on germination records and Wolfe was at his with a book he had just started on, an advance copy of The Future of Germany, by Karl Jaspers. I reached for the receiver.
"Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie - "
"I want Wolfe, Goodwin. Cramer."
"Greetings." Without bothering to cover the transmitter, I turned my head and said, "Cramer," perhaps a little louder than usual, and Wolfe reached for his phone, perhaps a little faster than usual. I kept mine.

"About Floyd Vance. You read the papers." "Yes."

"Not now. That may come later." He looked at the clock. "Get Mr. Jarrett. I’ll talk."
My brows went up. "Father or son?" "Mr. Cyrus M. Jarrett."
I nodded. "Yeah. I admit I’m fairly good at filling orders, but this time I need specifications. My batting record for getting Cyrus M. Jarrett to the phone is nothing for two. I think the person I get is named Oscar."
"I’ll speak with Oscar."
My brows were up again as I swiveled, got the phone, and dialed area code 914 and a number. Wolfe had his receiver to his ear, so all my part needed was a finger, but I stayed on. After four rings the remembered male voice said, "Mr. Jarrett’s residence."
==> "My name is Nero Wolfe. I am calling from New York. I wish to speak to Mr. Jarrett. Tell him - don’t interrupt me. Tell him that I wish to speak with him about Floyd Vance. Repeat that name." <==
"But Mr. Jarrett is eating - "
"I told you to repeat that name. Floyd Vance." "Floyd Vance."

Good. Mr. Jarrett will be able to hear you. He doesn’t eat with his ears. Tell him that I must speak with him now about Floyd Vance. You have my name?"
"Yes, sir."

"I’ll hold the wire, but don’t keep me waiting."
I probably wasn’t breathing. It was a king-size gamble, and I was posting no odds. Too much depended on it. So the obvious step was drawing to what could be an inside straight. Not only was it possible that there was no close connection between Jarrett and Floyd Vance, and there was some other explanation for the checks Jarrett had sent, it was even conceivable that he had never heard of Floyd Vance. It could be that the next thing we would hear would be Oscar, if it was Oscar, hanging up.
But it wasn’t. I didn’t time it because I was hanging on a cliff, but I think it was about three hours. I mean three minutes.
"You’re interrupting my dinner." I nodded at Wolfe. It was him. "Mr. Jarrett?"
"Yes."
==> "My name is Nero Wolfe. I don’t like to interrupt any man’s meal, but it’s urgent. I have a decision to make that can’t be delayed. I just now conversed with the police officer who is in charge of the investigation of the murder of Elinor Denovo, and I can tell you in confidence that Mr. Archie Goodwin, who has been to see you twice, and I are responsible for the arrest of Floyd Vance as the culprit. To justify a charge of first-degree murder the police wish to establish a motive, arid it is manifest that it would help them to have your name so they can ask you about the association of Floyd Vance and Elinor Denovo twenty- three years ago. That would inevitably lead to your appearance on the witness stand at the trial of Floyd Vance, and I am reluctant to take the responsibility for exposing a man of your standing to such an ordeal. Before disclosing your name I would like to discuss the situation with you, and I’ll expect you here, at my office, at eleven o’clock tomorrow morning." <==
"Was my name mentioned in your talk with the police officer?"

 "No."
"I know nothing about the association of Floyd Vance and Elinor Denovo twenty-three years ago."
"Pfui. I’ll call Mr. McCray at once and advise him to make sure that certain checks in the files of the Seaboard Bank and Trust Company are not disturbed. If the police want them they can get a court order."

"I don’t know. She says it’s in her possession legally."
He put his bookmark, a thin strip of gold that was a gift from a client, at his page and put the book down. "What was said yesterday. In full."
I had expected that. He hates to take on a job; anything to hold off a commitment. Also, there was the chance that there might be one or more details that he could find unacceptable. I reported. It had taken a lot of practice to get to where I could give a long conversation verbatim, but it was a cinch now, even with three or four talking. As usual, he leaned back and closed his eyes, and didn’t interrupt. There was no reaction even to the "pigheaded and high-nosed

 and toplofty." I omitted nothing except the irrelevant chatter while we were eating. When I finished he stayed put for a minute and then opened his eyes and straightened up.
==> He regarded me. "That’s not like you, Archie. It’s hardly even a sketch. Barely a start." <==
"Certainly. There was no point in going deeper with a poor little poor girl."
He looked up at the wall clock and back at me. "You could have - no matter. Very well. Bring her."
I went and opened the connecting door. She was still in the chair by the window, and hadn’t returned the parcel to her bag; it was in her lap. I told her to come.
Wolfe seldom rises when someone enters the office, and never if it’s a woman. His expression is always the same if it’s a woman, no matter who or what she is; he is concentrating on not making a face. There is no telling what he notices or doesn’t; for instance, whether he noticed that the skirt of Amy Denovo’s brown- striped summer dress wasn’t really a mini; it was only about two inches above her knees. Certainly he didn’t notice that the knees were worthy of notice, though they were, since that had no bearing on her acceptability as a client. The seat of the red leather chair near the end of his desk was too deep for her to settle back, so she sat on the front half, straight, and put her bag on the stand at her elbow, with the parcel in her lap.
Wolfe, his chair swiveled to face her, his fingers curled over the arm ends, spoke. "So Mr. Goodwin impressed you at first sight."

"Yes, all but that." She gestured toward his desk. "The box is in my apartment - on Eighty-second Street. And the letter. But I don’t want ... Mr. Goodwin mentioned the Internal Revenue Service."
"We are not government agents, Miss Denovo, and are not obliged to disclose information received in confidence." He swiveled his head to look at the clock.

 "It is ten minutes to our dinnertime. May Mr. Goodwin call on you at your apartment at ten tomorrow morning?"
"Yes. I don’t go to Miss Rowan on Saturday."
==> "Then expect him around ten o’clock. He will want to see the box and its contents, and the letter, and he will want all the information you can give him. What you told him yesterday is a mere prologue." He turned. "Archie. Give her a receipt for this money. Not as a retainer; that can wait until you have seen the box and the letter, and you will verify the handwriting of the letter. Just a receipt for the amount, her property, entrusted to me for safekeeping." <==
I turned my chair, pulled the typewriter around, and opened a drawer for paper and carbon.

I WAS INTERESTED, naturally, in Elinor Denovo’s apartment. We were probably going to need to know everything about her that was knowable, and a woman’s home can have a hundred hints, two or three of which you may get if you have any savvy at all and are lucky. So before settling down with Amy and my notebook in the living room I took a tour, with Amy along. There were a small foyer, a medium-sized living room, two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a small kitchen. If the foyer or kitchen or bathroom had any hints they weren’t for me; for instance, there was nothing in the bathroom to indicate that it had ever been used by a man, but of course Elinor hadn’t been there for nearly three months.
I gave Amy’s bedroom just a glance; for her I had a better source of hints, herself. She said she hadn’t changed anything in her mother’s bedroom. It might have told a woman, especially a Lily Rowan, a lot, but all I got was that she had liked pale green for drapes and the bed cover, she used three different scents, all expensive, and she didn’t mind if the rug had a big spot near the bathroom door. The living room did have a few hints which might help or might not. There were five pictures on the walls, and they were all color reproductions of paintings by Georgia O’Keeffe - data supplied by Amy. I would have to check on O’Keeffe. The only piece of furniture that was upholstered was the couch, and there were only two cushions on it. I have seen couches with a dozen. The four chairs didn’t match one another, and none of them matched the couch. The books, seven

 you know if there has been any progress since?"
He got at a phone, the green one this time, pressed a button, and in a moment talked, and then waited. While he waited another phone buzzed, and stopped when he pushed a button. In a couple of minutes he told the green phone, "Yeah, sure." In another couple of minutes he cradled it, turned to me and said, "Apparently it’s dead. Our last word, more than a month ago, was that we might as well cross it off. They had only one man still on it. But now of course, with Nero Wolfe horning in, it’s far from dead. So it was murder. I don’t expect you to name him, even off the record, but I want enough for a page one box."
I was on my feet. "Journalists," I said, "are the salt and pepper of the earth. I would enjoy discussing that with you, but I’m on my way to a rustic swimming pool in the middle of a tailor-made glade in the Westchester woods, and I’m twenty hours late. I said it was something trivial, but have it your way. Yes, it was murder, and the driver of the car was the skunk who topped my three aces with four deuces Thursday night. I hope they get him."
I turned and went.
But down in the lobby I went to a phone booth, dialed a number I didn’t have to look up, gave my name, asked if Sergeant Stebbins was around, and after a long wait got his voice:
==> "Stebbins. Something up, Archie?" <==
He must have just won a bet or got a raise. He called me Archie only about once in two years, and sometimes he wouldn’t even say Goodwin but made it just you. I returned the compliment. "Nothing with a bite, Purley, just a routine question, but to answer it you may have to look at a file. You may have forgotten it, it was nearly three months ago - a hit-and-run on East Eighty-third Street, a woman named Elinor Denovo - "
"We haven’t forgotten it. We don’t forget a hit-and-run."
"I know you don’t, I was just being impolite for practice. Someone asked me if you’ve dug up a lead on it, and of course I didn’t know. Have you?"
"Who asked you?"

"Who asked you?"

Oh, Mr. Wolfe and I were discussing crime and whether cops are as good as they ought to be, and he mentioned this Elinor Denovo. As you know, he misses nothing in the papers. I said you would probably get that one, and I was curious. Of course I’m not asking for any inside dope ..."

"All of that. The kind of break you read about. Shall I take him first instead of Thorne?"
"I think not." Another pause. "It needs reflection."
"Okay. Don’t stand in the hall at lunchtime. I may not make it."
When I got back to the table Amy had started her third cup of coffee. As I sat she said, "I’ve been thinking. You’re wonderful, Mr. Goodwin. Simply

==>  wonderful. I wish ... I want to call you Archie." <==
"Try it and see what happens. I might like it. Since you say your mother was being sarcastic when she tagged you Amy I suppose you wish your name was Araminta or Hephzibah, or you pick it."
"I could pick a better one."
"I’ll bet you could. Now we have a problem. I have to ask people questions about your mother, a few of those whose names you gave me yesterday, and I am to start with Raymond Thorne. You’ll phone him and tell him you’re sending me and you hope he’ll cooperate, but I can’t just say I’m after men your mother knew in the summer of nineteen forty-four - that’s when the genes met - since you don’t want anyone to know or even suspect that it’s a father hunt. So I have a suggestion, approved by Mr. Wolfe, which we expect you to approve."
"Oh, I’ll approve anything you - " She stopped and tightened her lips. Then she smiled. "Listen to me. You might think I had no brains at all. Tell me and we’ll see." I told her.

y not offer him nine in the evening too?"
"As you know, I don’t like to work after dinner. But I suppose... Very well. Add it."
I pulled the typewriter around and got out paper and carbon.
An hour later, as I headed north on the Henry Hudson Parkway, keeping to sixty, I wasn’t on a perch either professionally or personally. Professionally, the client was being neglected. I had phoned her Friday morning that it was very unlikely that Jarrett was her father, and told her why, and that was all. She deserved to know that she had been right about Denovo, that her mother’s real name was Carlotta Vaughn; at least we could give her that for the eight days we had been on it. Personally, there I was bound for a swimming pool in a glade while Orrie was in Washington digging into army records and Saul and Fred were poking into holes that were probably empty. I should have been doing something brilliant, like finding a mattress somewhere with hairs from two human heads on it which a scientist would prove had been left there by Carlotta Vaughn, alias Elinor Denovo, and Eugene Jarrett.
==> I wasn’t feeling any better as I drove back to town Sunday evening. The weekend had been messy. There is never more than one house guest besides me; it may be anybody from a female poet to a cowboy from the Montana ranch Lily owns; and that time it was Amy Denovo. She gave it a good start only an hour after I arrived. She called me Archie. We were on the terrace. I had finished off the steak Mimi had broiled - they had eaten - and was forking the blueberry pie when Amy got out a cigarette and I lit it, and she said, "Thank you, Archie." Of course Lily didn’t bat an eye; she wouldn’t. But as far as she knew Amy had seen me only three times for a total of about nine minutes, and she didn’t have to be a cluster of vagaries to wonder what the score was. Was Amy just being flip, or had I decided to see more of her, not at the penthouse, and taken steps? I couldn’t tell her what Miss Denovo had hired Wolfe to do, so I skipped it. But it was there in the air. Between Lily and me it was thoroughly understood that what I did was none of her business unless it touched her - and, naturally, vice versa - but the fact that I had met Miss Denovo at the penthouse put it on the borderline. So it didn’t help the weekend. <==
A couple of other things didn’t help either. One of the five guests for lunch Saturday was a woman with a green wig who had positive inside information

 that President Johnson and Dean Rusk had decided three years ago to kill everybody in China with hydrogen bombs, and that was the real reason for what they were doing in Vietnam.
Of course the only thing to do with such a clunk is to ignore him or her, but she kept it up so loud and long that I finally told her that I had positive inside information that Senator Fulbright had once had an affair with one of Ho Chi Minh’s concubines, and that was the real reason he wanted the bombing stopped. That was a mistake. The idea appealed to her and she wanted all the details.
And Sunday afternoon some uninvited people dropped in - a couple I had met there before who had a place over beyond Bedford Village. They weren’t so bad, but they had a guy with them who they said had talked them into coming because he wanted to meet me. His name was Floyd Vance and he said he was a public-relations counselor. Evidently he wanted to meet me because he wanted to meet Nero Wolfe. He was drumming up trade. He said that if anybody needed expert handling of his public image a private detective did, and he would like very much to create a presentation to propose to Nero Wolfe. He also said that if we were working on a case and I would tell him about it, he could use that as a basis for the presentation. When he said that I sharpened my eyes and ears a little, and my tongue, thinking he might be making a stab at detective work himself for somebody, for instance Cyrus M. Jarrett, but decided he was just another character who was so dedicated to improving other people’s images that he had no time left for his own. I met one once who - no, that’s enough for that weekend.

So as I said, I wasn’t feeling any better as I drove back to town. Sometimes it’s things that take the joy out of life, like a blowout when you’re hitting sixty or a button coming off of a shirt when you’re in a hurry, but usually it’s people. Of course, of the three people who had made that weekend less than perfect Amy was the only one whose contribution would carry over. Lily would do some wondering for a week or so - who wouldn’t? - but I certainly wasn’t going to explain. When two people who want to get along start needing to have things explained, look out. I would tell the client about her mother’s real name when I felt like it.

THE TROUBLE WITH PUTTING a box number on an ad instead of your name and address and phone number, especially if it’s in three papers, is getting the replies. Phoning at ten o’clock Monday morning and learning that there were some, I went for them, got two at the Times and four at the Gazette, opened them there, and found them so screwy that I bothered to take them home only because I always keep everything connected with a job until it’s finished. One was from a man who said Carlotta Vaughn was his grandmother, and maybe a Carlotta Vaughn was, but he didn’t mention Elinor Denovo.
When I got back a little after eleven Fritz said there had been no calls, but as I entered the office the phone rang and I crossed to my desk, nodding to Wolfe on the way, and got it.
==> "Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie Goodwin speaking." <==
Female voice: "Good morning. Mr. Jarrett would like to speak to Mr. Wolfe." "Good morning. Please put Mr. Jarrett on."
"Is Mr. Wolfe there?"
"Yes."
"Please put him on."
"Now listen." I motioned to Wolfe. "Last Friday I got Mr. McCray for Mr. Wolfe and I was forced to put Mr. Wolfe on first You can’t have it coming and going. Put Mr. Jarrett on or I hang up."

"May I have your name, please?"
==> "Archie Goodwin." <==
"Please hold the wire, Mr. Goodwin."
I timed it: two minutes and twenty seconds. Wolfe bad his phone. "Eugene Jarrett speaking. Nero Wolfe?"
Me: "Please hold the wire, Mr. Jarrett."
Wolfe should have waited at least a minute, but he hates the phone, either

"Good. As I said in the letter, I’ll appreciate it. I’ll expect you."
They hung up together. There was a case where the approach took five minutes and the meet about ten seconds. A piece by a scientist in the Sunday New York Times Magazine which I had read during the weekend had explained why this is the age of instant communication.
There were some items in the morning mail that needed attention, or at least got it, but we were interrupted a few times by phone calls: from Saul, who had drawn nothing but blanks; from Fred, who had found three people who had recognized the photographs but hadn’t been any help; and from Orrie, from Washington, who had verified most of Jarrett’s places and dates and was working on the rest. The hospital part, which covered most of July, was airtight. You are probably thinking that the client was getting damned little for her money, and I agree. When I returned from a trip to the mailbox at the corner it was lunchtime, and as we crossed to the dining room Wolfe said something about Mr. Cramer and I asked if he had phoned. Wolfe said no, he had come, late Saturday afternoon.
I was sorry I had missed it because talk by those two is always worth hearing. You get good examples of how much a man can say in a few words and also of how little he can say in a lot of words. So back in the office after lunch I said I would just as soon know what Cramer had wanted, and Wolfe said only what he always wanted, information; he had said nothing that would help us any.
I settled back and crossed my legs. "I haven’t kept count," I said, "but at least a thousand times I have given you a verbatim report of a conversation. I can’t tell you to because I don’t pay you, you pay me, but I can suggest it. I am suggesting it."
==> A corner of his mouth went up a sixteenth of an inch. For him it was a broad smile. "My memory is as good as yours, Archie." <==
"Then it would be no strain. I said verbatim."
"I know you did." He squinted at me. "Well ... Mr. Cramer, admitted by Fritz,

 arrived shortly after six o’clock. We ex - "
"The exact time?"

"No. But I can label any man whose faculties are concentrated on a single purpose. I can label Charles de Gaulle or Robert Welch or Stokely Carmichael."
"If you do, don’t glue them on, and have replacements handy."
Jarrett nodded. "Nothing is unalterable, not even a label. I have altered mine for my father several times. I mention him because it is apropos. The only reference to him in your letter was that Carlotta Vaughn was in his employ, but Bert McCray has told me about your poke at him and how he met it. He has also told me of your intention to transfer the poke to me. I would enjoy discussing my father with you - we might get a better label for him than the one I have - but your letter asks about Carlotta Vaughn. First we should dispose of me. You thought my father was the father of a child she bore, were confronted with evidence that he wasn’t, and decided that I was. Is that correct?"
"Not ‘decided.’ Conjectured or surmised - or even inferred."
"No matter. You’re in for another disappointment. When Bert McCray told me about it Saturday, and then when your letter came, I decided to save you time and expense - and of course avoid annoyance for myself - by telling you something that many people conjecture or surmise but only a few really know. But I realized that my telling you wouldn’t settle it for you, so this morning I phoned my doctor."
==> He turned to me. "You’re Archie Goodwin?" <==
I told him yes. He got a leather case from his pocket, fingered a card out, and extended his hand, and I went and took the card. The "James Odell Worthington, M.D." might actually have been engraved.
"Dr. Worthington will see you at nine tomorrow morning," Jarrett said. "Be on time; he’s a very busy man. He will tell you that I am incapable of impregnating a woman and always have been. He has a reputation and would on no account risk it by telling you that if there was any remote possibility that you would ever prove him wrong."


He turned to Wolfe. "Your letter said that you want information about Carlotta Vaughn."

"We have Saul and Fred and Orrie. And me. And, oh, yes, excuse me, we have you."
He looked at his current book, always there on the desk, picked it up, dropped it, and glared at me.

SIXTY-EIGHT HOURS LATER, at three o’clock Thursday afternoon, Wolfe and I sat in the office with nothing more to say. We still had exactly what we had had Monday at dinnertime, five detectives, counting us.
==> First, to finish off Eugene Jarrett. At 8:50 Tuesday morning I had got off the elevator at the tenth floor of a building on Park Avenue in the Eighties, given my name to a woman at a desk, and been sent to a big old-fashioned room with twenty chairs distributed around the walls and tables, eight or nine of them occupied by people who didn’t look very gay, which wasn’t too discouraging because the names of four M.D.s had been on the plaque. At 9:20 another woman had come and ushered me down a hall to a door which she opened. When I entered, a gray-haired man with shaggy black eyebrows and a tired wide mouth, at a desk, writing on a pad, nodded and pointed to a chair, went on writing for a couple of minutes, and then put the pen down and turned to me. He asked if my name was Archie Goodwin and I said yes, and he said that since the information he was to give me was confidential he would like to be sure... <==
I got my wallet out and showed him things, and he nodded and looked at his wristwatch. "We squeezed you in," he said, "because Mr. Jarrett said it was urgent. He asked me to confirm his statement to you that he is sterile and has been sterile all his adult life. Very well, I do. That is true."
"If you don’t mind," I said, "we want it airtight. That’s of your personal knowledge? Not hearsay?"
"I wouldn’t make such a statement from hearsay. My professional knowledge, yes. Four examinations and analyses, at intervals, in seventeen years. Not only is the sperm count per se too low, but also the percentage of abnormal forms is too high. It is conclusive."
"Thank you. Seventeen years ago was nineteen fifty. What about earlier? Say nineteen forty-four."
He shook his head. "Extremely unlikely. I would accept it as a possibility only on incontrovertible evidence, and even then with reluctance. I have known the family for nearly thirty years, since nineteen forty. If Eugene Jarrett was fertile hi nineteen forty-four only certain infections - mumps is the commonest one - could have caused his present condition, and he has had none of them." He looked at his watch. "Mr. Jarrett didn’t tell me what this is about. If it’s a paternity suit it’s ridiculous. I would be glad to testify."

 woman. She had offers of twice, three, or four times as much as she could make with me, agencies and public-relations people, but she turned them all down."
"Why?"
"I don’t know. My guess was that they were mostly big outfits and she liked the complete freedom she had with me."
"What if I asked you to tell me everything you heard her say that morning? Could you do it?"
"My God, no. Anyway it was just business. There couldn’t possibly have been anything with any hint of what was going to happen to her that night. You know, I might be better at this if I knew why you think it was premeditated murder. Goodwin told me it was Amy’s intuition. Isn’t a hit-and-run nearly always just a hit-and-run?"
==> "Yes. I would Eke to oblige you, Mr. Thorne, if only as a token of Miss Denovo’s appreciation of your willingness to help, but I can’t divulge information that the police are reserving. Only five hours ago a police officer of high rank, discussing that hit-and-run with Mr. Goodwin, said, ‘He got a cigar out to light it while he was parked on Second Avenue waiting for her, and there she came.’ If I were free to tell you more I would. Help yourself to brandy. If you please, Archie, beer?" <==
That was a fair example of how to lie while sticking to the truth. It was perfectly true that he couldn’t, or anyhow shouldn’t, divulge information that the police were reserving. It was also true that a high-ranking police officer had said that to me. So a truth plus a truth equaled a bare-faced lie.
It was the only one he told during the four long hours that Thorne sat in the red leather chair while downing a third of a bottle of marvelous cognac. I doubted if he knew how good it was; a man had once offered Wolfe fifty bucks for a bottle of it.
The four hours took us an hour and a half past midnight, into Friday morning, and the brandy took Thorne into a kind of talking trance that made him forget about time, and also seemed to oil his memory, which was just luck. He remembered Thursday a little better than Friday, and by the time they got back to Monday he was remembering so much that I began to suspect him. He had

 remarked at one point that he had done some scriptwriting, so he had had practice making things up.

As I said, I nearly let it slide by. It hit me a little later as I was telling my jaw and cheek muscles to get set to hide another yawn, and I made a mistake. I forgot the yawn and my jaws opened wide for it. That led me into a second mistake, which often happens. Preferring not to let Thorne know that he had told us a fact which might be significant, I tried to go on as I had been for an hour, looking more awake and alert than I was, and I overdid it. If he had been awake and alert he would have noticed it, but by that time his talking trance was in command and it would have made no impression on him if I had wiggled my ears.
But Wolfe noticed it, and that was what kept him from going on and on and making a night of it unless Thorne ran down. So it was only half past one and they had only got to the middle of Monday afternoon when he looked at the clock and said he was too tired to continue, and Thorne must be too. Miss Denovo would deeply appreciate Thorne’s cooperation, and he and Mr. Goodwin would see if they could find a hint in any of the items Thorne had supplied. As Thorne used both hands on the chair arm to get to his feet I was thinking that I would have to steer him out and down the stoop steps, and possibly even go and get the Heron to cart him home, but he did all right. Going down the hall he put a hand to the wall once to steady himself, and outside he stood and brought his shoulders up and took a couple of deep breaths, but he made it down to the sidewalk without any trouble. I stayed to watch him for about thirty paces. Okay.
As I entered the office Wolfe growled at me, "You got something. What?"


==> I went to my desk and sat. "Nothing would please me more than to catch one you should have caught and missed, but I can’t claim it on this. I think we’ve got a nibble. I don’t know whether it’s the father or the murderer, or possibly both, but I think it’s a nibble. Last Sunday afternoon at Miss Rowan’s place in the country three people came who had not been invited and weren’t expected. Two of them were friends of hers - well, acquaintances; I had met them there before - who have a place half an hour away. The third one was their weekend house guest, a man named Floyd Vance. They said they had mentioned to him that Archie Goodwin was often at Lily Rowan’s for weekends, and he had got them to drive him over because he wanted to meet me. I gathered from what he said that what he really wanted was to meet you. He said he was a public-relations counselor. He said that if anybody needed expert handling of his public image a private detective did, and he would like to create a presentation to propose to you. He also said that if we were working on a case and I would tell him about it, he could use that as a basis for the presentation. At that, naturally, I looked and listened, but decided he was just trying to find another sucker for his racket. I now sincerely hope I was wrong. Two comments. One, there are probably very few Floyd Vances around. Two, allowing for the twenty-three years, he fits Salvatore Manzoni’s description just fine." <==
"I would like some beer," Wolfe said.
"You’re already two bottles ahead and it’s going on two o’clock."
"Satisfactory," he said, leaving it open whether he meant the beer or the nibble. He gripped the edge of the desk to push his chair back, rose, and headed for the hall. For a second I thought he was walking out, to go to bed with the nibble, but he turned left in the hall. He was going for beer. When he returned he had a bottle and a glass in one hand and a snifter in the other. He put the bottle and glass on his desk, got the cognac bottle from the stand and poured a couple of ounces in the snifter.
"You might easily have missed it," he said, and went around to his chair, opened the bottle, and poured.
I whirled the brandy around in the snifter and said, "I almost did. If it’s only a coincidence I’m through with the detective business for good. We’ll soon know, one way or another. The quickest and most obvious would be to have Salvatore Manzoni take a look at the public-relations Floyd Vance, but twenty-three years

I got the Manhattan book and found the page. "Four-ninety Lexington Avenue. Not the best. It should be Madison."
"Tell them to trace him back and cover nineteen forty-four thoroughly, but not to risk prompting him. That will be no problem with Saul and Fred, but with Orrie make it emphatic as usual."
"Right." I had emptied the snifter during the lip act, and as he pushed his chair back I went to pour another swallow. It might put me to sleep a few seconds quicker.

NOT A FLY. Flies don’t buzz. Mosquito. No. Too loud. What the ... Oh. House phone, for God’s sake. I opened an eye, stretched an arm and got it, said, "Well?"
==> Fritz’s voice said, "Good morning, Archie. He wants you." <==
I glared at the clock on the bedstand, realized that it actually said twenty-five minutes past eight, and swung my feet around. Figuring out whether I had failed to turn the alarm on, or it had tried to stir me and it had failed, would have to wait. I called for will power, gave it time to deliver, made it to my feet, concentrated on locating the door, and stepped.
The door of Wolfe’s room, which is above the kitchen, at the rear of the house where he gets the sun in winter, stood open. When I entered, with my bare feet making no sound, he was seated at the table, with the Times propped on the rack, dropping a bit of toast into the sauce of eggs au beurre noir. When I cleared my throat he got the toast to and into his mouth before he turned his head.
"The time is out of joint," I said.
He frowned. "I don’t talk in quotations, even Shakespeare, and neither do you."

"I’m aware," I said, "that if we did it again Fritz might leave and you might too. I don’t mean here. She spends most of her days at Miss Rowan’s, and she could spend her nights there too until we get him or drop him. Miss Rowan has two spare rooms. I’ll suggest it. Anything else?"
He said no and I went back up a flight to do in ten minutes what usually takes me thirty. By the time I got down to the kitchen, having stopped in the office to tell Fred and Orrie that Saul and I were going to pick up a trail and might need them later, my fog was starting to clear.


A detective is supposed to get onto things and people, but I gave up long ago trying to get onto Fritz all the way, so I didn’t bother to try to guess how he had known Fred and Orrie would be leaving and Saul would be staying. He knows Saul loves his eggs au beurre noir, and there were two chairs and two places ready at my breakfast table. Saul went to the range to watch him baste, and said he had tried it a hundred times but it never tasted the same. As we ate I told Saul about Floyd Vance and the various angles, and we took our second cups of coffee to the office to consider ways and means. Wolfe had said that the first question was, Is he involved? but Saul agreed with me that it couldn’t do any harm to regard that as answered and proceed accordingly. He also agreed that it would help if he had a look at him, and I got at the phone and dialed the number of Nathaniel Parker, the lawyer.
==> "Yes, Archie?" I like the way Parker says yes, Archie. He knows that handling something for Wolfe can be interesting but that it may be tough and ticklish, so the yes, Archie is half glad and half sad. <==
I told him it was nothing much this time. "Just a little chore. A man named Floyd Vance has an office at Four-ninety Lexington Avenue. He’s a counselor, but not at law, at public relations, which as you know is a much newer profession. The chore is to ring him and tell him you have a client who is thinking of engaging his services, and you would like to send a man to discuss it with him. The name of the man is Saul Panzer, whose qualifications you know about. He can go any time, the sooner the better. I’m going out, but Saul will be here to take your call. You have the name? Floyd Vance."
"I have it. What if he wants particulars?" "You’re not prepared to give him any."
"That’s a good way to put it. I am certainly not prepared. Give the genius my regards."
He meant it, but he knew I knew exactly what he would put in a long footnote. I dialed another familiar number to make another request and then went up to my room for a quick shave and change. The ten minutes before breakfast hadn’t been enough.

t was too hot to walk the more than two miles to East Sixty-third Street, and anyway I had told Lily I would be there by eleven-thirty. It was five minutes short of that when I pushed the button at the penthouse door and got a mild surprise when Mimi opened it. When I am expected at a certain hour it’s nearly always Lily who comes, I think on account of some kind of a notion she has about a maid admitting a man who has a key. I have never tried to dope it. Other people’s notions are none of my business unless they get in the way. Then I got a second mild surprise. I had told Lily on the phone that I wanted to see both her and Miss Denovo, but even so, why were they out on the terrace at that hour with a pitcher of iced tea when they should have been inside working? The penthouse was air-conditioned. Was Lily actually still ... To hell with it. I was working. I moved another chair over, between them, sat, accepted an offer of tea with lime and mint, and said, "Don’t mind my manners, I have a busy day ahead." I turned to Lily. "We’re working on a problem for Miss Denovo. We’ve been on it - "
==> "Archie! No." <==
That was an example of a client’s notion getting in the way. "I’m talking," I told her distinctly and returned to Lily. "It’s very personal and she doesn’t want anyone to know about it, not even you, and I’m proud and happy that she trusts me so much that she calls me Archie, so about her problem I’ll only say that she is not responsible for it. Other people created it; she merely wants to solve it. She came to see Nero Wolfe two weeks ago today."
"Why do you - " Amy started, and stopped.
Lily was smiling at me. "Ole, Escamillo," she said, and put a kiss on a fingertip and flipped it to me.
"Last night," I told Amy, "there was a development. With Miss Rowan here I can’t give you the details, and I wouldn’t anyhow at this stage. But it is now more than a wild guess that your mother’s death wasn’t just an accidental hit- and-run, that it was deliberate murder, and if so it’s possible that he has ideas about you. We don’t know - "

 and his address had been Ten East Thirty-ninth Street. It had to be a business address, because there were no residential buildings in that block. That was satisfactory on two counts: one, that he had been around in 1944, and two, that his office had been in walking distance of Tufitti’s restaurant on East Forty-sixth Street for lunch or dinner. The next step, naturally, was to have a look at Ten East Thirty-ninth Street, but it had to wait because Saul was expected for lunch and a conference. When my taxi turned into Thirty-fifth Street from Ninth Avenue, Saul was just getting out of one double-parked in front of the old brownstone.
The next hour, at the lunch table, provided nourishment for both my stomach and brain. For the stomach, sweetbreads amandine in patty shells and cold green-corn pudding. For the brain, a debate on the question whether music, any music, has, or can have, any intellectual content. Wolfe said no and Saul said yes. I backed Saul because he weighs only about half as much as Wolfe, but I thought he made some very good points, which impressed me because one recent Thursday evening at his apartment he had been playing a piece by Debussy, I think it was, on the piano for Lon Cohen and me while we waited for the others to come for poker, and Lon had said something about the piece’s intellectual force, and Saul had said no music could possibly have intellectual force. As the woman said to the parrot, it depends on who you’re talking to.
In the office after lunch I told Wolfe what Saul and I had decided about the approach, including my phone calls to Nathaniel Parker and Lily, and then reported. "I did one thing," I said, "and learned one thing. I arranged for the client to stay put in Miss Rowan’s penthouse until further notice, and I learned that in nineteen forty-four Floyd Vance had a telephone at an office at Ten East Thirty-ninth Street. There wasn’t time to go and have a look, but I know that the wreckers haven’t got to that block and the old buildings on the south side are still there. Unless Saul got something hotter we’ll go and surround it."
Wolfe looked at Saul.
==> "Nothing even warm," Saul said. "It always helps to see a subject, but Archie had already seen him, so it’s no news that he’s a middle-aged slouch who may have been quite a fine figure twenty-three years ago. He has two little rooms, with him in one and a blonde with too much lipstick in the other, and when I asked about his past and present clients he either had very little to show or he wasn’t showing me. Of course he wanted to know who Parker’s client was, that <==

 was natural, but he pressed me on it more than he should have. I was getting so little that I almost made a mistake. I thought of asking him if he had ever had a television producer for a client, but of course I didn’t. I was thinking on my way there that it might be possible to get something with a nice collection of his fingerprints on it, but he was right there with me in that little room. If he locks the door when he leaves that would be no problem. The lock’s an ordinary Wingate. Archie or I could open it with our eyes shut."
Wolfe shook his head. "We have no use for fingerprints now. Possibly later."
"I know, but I thought it would be nice to have them. I mention it only because I can’t match what Archie got - that nineteen forty-four address." Saul looked at me. "It’s still August and the weekend starts in a couple of hours." He got up. "Let’s go, you can plan it on the way."
For two able-bodied, quick-witted, well-trained men Saul and I accomplished a lot in the next two days. He got a haircut, which is quite a feat on a Saturday or Sunday in summer for a man who lives in midtown Manhattan. I detected it when I met him Monday morning. As for me, I frittered away $23.85 of the client’s money on taxi fares and tips between ten a.m. and seven p.m. Saturday, which is also quite a feat. Just three doors away from Ten East Thirty-ninth Street was a lunchroom, Dwyer’s, with a long fountain counter, and the manager told me it had been there for thirty years. He had himself been there nineteen years, and that meant only since 1948, but he knew the name of the man who had preceded him and he had an address in the Bronx where he had lived. The name was Herman Gottschalk, and I spent nine hours trying to track him down so I could show him photographs of seven young women.

That wasn’t dumb; it was merely desperate. Of course the obvious place to look for someone to ask about the tenants and frequenters of that building in 1944 was the building itself, but Saul and I had pretty well covered that Friday afternoon. There was no elevator man or other service man who had been there more-than four years except the building superintendent. He had got the job in 1961, soon after the building had been acquired by its present owner, and he told Saul his predecessor had been there only five years. He didn’t even know the name of the former owner or agent. He did know that none of the present tenants had been there as long as twenty-three years.

Wolfe looked at Saul.
"Nothing even warm," Saul said. "It always helps to see a subject, but Archie had already seen him, so it’s no news that he’s a middle-aged slouch who may have been quite a fine figure twenty-three years ago. He has two little rooms, with him in one and a blonde with too much lipstick in the other, and when I asked about his past and present clients he either had very little to show or he wasn’t showing me. Of course he wanted to know who Parker’s client was, that

 was natural, but he pressed me on it more than he should have. I was getting so little that I almost made a mistake. I thought of asking him if he had ever had a television producer for a client, but of course I didn’t. I was thinking on my way there that it might be possible to get something with a nice collection of his fingerprints on it, but he was right there with me in that little room. If he locks the door when he leaves that would be no problem. The lock’s an ordinary Wingate. Archie or I could open it with our eyes shut."
Wolfe shook his head. "We have no use for fingerprints now. Possibly later."
==> "I know, but I thought it would be nice to have them. I mention it only because I can’t match what Archie got - that nineteen forty-four address." Saul looked at me. "It’s still August and the weekend starts in a couple of hours." He got up. "Let’s go, you can plan it on the way." <==
For two able-bodied, quick-witted, well-trained men Saul and I accomplished a lot in the next two days. He got a haircut, which is quite a feat on a Saturday or Sunday in summer for a man who lives in midtown Manhattan. I detected it when I met him Monday morning. As for me, I frittered away $23.85 of the client’s money on taxi fares and tips between ten a.m. and seven p.m. Saturday, which is also quite a feat. Just three doors away from Ten East Thirty-ninth Street was a lunchroom, Dwyer’s, with a long fountain counter, and the manager told me it had been there for thirty years. He had himself been there nineteen years, and that meant only since 1948, but he knew the name of the man who had preceded him and he had an address in the Bronx where he had lived. The name was Herman Gottschalk, and I spent nine hours trying to track him down so I could show him photographs of seven young women.
That wasn’t dumb; it was merely desperate. Of course the obvious place to look for someone to ask about the tenants and frequenters of that building in 1944 was the building itself, but Saul and I had pretty well covered that Friday afternoon. There was no elevator man or other service man who had been there more-than four years except the building superintendent. He had got the job in 1961, soon after the building had been acquired by its present owner, and he told Saul his predecessor had been there only five years. He didn’t even know the name of the former owner or agent. He did know that none of the present tenants had been there as long as twenty-three years. At the Third Avenue office of the East and West Realty Corporation, the current agent, the only personnel on duty Saturday morning were a girl whose mother should have made her wear teeth braces and an old man with a glass eye who didn’t even know the name of the

 previous owner or agent.
I accomplished something else on Sunday. I took Lily Rowan and Amy Denovo to a double-header at Shea Stadium, and got the client back to the penthouse safe and sound.

Monday morning a sunburned woman at the East and West Realty Corporation gave us the name of the previous agent, Kauffman Management Company, and at their office on Forty-second Street we were lucky enough to find a smart and active young man who believed in giving service. He spent half an hour looking up old records. The man who had been the superintendent at Ten East Thirty- ninth Street in 1944, named William Polk, had died in 1962. There was no record of the names of any of the service personnel, but there was a complete list of the 1944 tenants - twenty-two of them, counting Floyd Vance - and we copied it. The smart young man said there was no one active in the Kauffman Management Company who had been there for twenty-three years. Bernard Kauffman, who had founded it, was dead.
==> Saul and I each took half of the list of tenants and went to work on them. I could make a full report on the first four I tackled, but this is not a treatise on economics or sociology. It was the fifth one that rang the gong, a little before five o’clock in the afternoon - a woman named Dorothy Sebor, fifty, gray-haired and blue-eyed and fully as smart as the young man at the Kauffman Management Company - who beaded and probably owned the Sebor Shopping Service in a tenth-floor suite at Rockefeller Center. She was busy. The forty minutes I spent with her wouldn’t have been more than half that if the phone hadn’t interrupted several times, and I might have had a problem getting to her if I hadn’t sent in word that I wanted to ask her something about Ten East Thirty- ninth Street. When I entered her room she asked if I was the Archie Goodwin who worked for Nero Wolfe, and when I said yes she asked, "But what can I possibly tell you about Ten East Thirty-ninth Street? I left eighteen years ago. I loved that dump. Sit down." <==
I sat. "I don’t know what you can tell me, Miss Sebor, but I know what I want to ask. A job we’re on goes back pretty far and it’s nineteen forty-four we’re interested in. Would you mind telling me what floor you were on?"
"No, why should I? The ninth. In the rear."
"We understand that another of the tenants was named Floyd Vance. Did you

 know him?"

I expected him to start the lip act, but he merely cocked his head. "The point," he said, "is that we don’t know which of two alternative situations faces us. If he is the father but not a murderer, establishing it will be difficult if not impossible. He did that many years ago. But if he is also a murderer the situation is much simpler; he did that only three months ago. We’ll resolve that and then decide how to proceed. Can you get him here this evening?"
"For what? Do I ask him if he still wants to meet you?"
"That would do to start. If he says no, tell him I want to meet him. Tell him I want to ask him why he didn’t reply to the advertisement requesting information about Carlotta Vaughn, alias Elinor Denovo."
I had noted the listing of Vance’s home phone, but got the directory to check on the number, and found that my memory had it right. It was a quarter to seven when I dialed, and if he ate out I would probably get no answer. But after two rings I got a hello.
"Mr. Floyd Vance, please?" "I’m Floyd Vance."
==> "I’m Archie Goodwin. I work for Nero Wolfe. You may remember that we met at Lily Rowan’s place, and you - " <==
"I remember."
"And you said you would like to meet Nero Wolfe to make a proposal. I reminded Mr. Wolfe of that just now when we were discussing something, and he decided he would also like to meet you. Could you come this evening, say at nine o’clock?"

Silence. Five seconds. "This is short notice."
"I know. It’s not as urgent as a five-alarm fire, but if it’s not too inconvenient... the address is - "

"To hell with your courtesy. Shove it." Vance’s voice was not as I remembered it. I had thought he was a fairly smooth talker that Sunday, but now the words came out blurry. He went on, "I’ve learned something about you since I talked with Goodwin. You don’t give a damn about your public image. Did you get me here just to tell me you don’t like clichés? Do I go home now?"
Wolfe nodded. "That’s your question, why I got you here. My question is, Why did you come? I doubt if either of us expects a candid answer. In fact, Mr. Vance, I’m in some confusion about my objective. One possibility is that I would like to know why you prevailed on your friends to drive you to Miss Rowan’s so you could meet Mr. Goodwin. Another possibility is that I would like to know why you made several attempts to see Mrs. Elinor Denovo last May. Still another is that I want to ask you about your association with Miss Carlotta Vaughn in the summer of nineteen forty-four. And again, another is that I wondered why you didn’t reply to an advertisement which appeared - "

Jesus. Give me a pad and pencil. I’ll have to make notes."
We hadn’t wiped a pad. You can’t think of everything. I got one from a drawer, and a pencil, and went with them, and he took them, probably because he was uncertain what to do with his tongue and so was glad to have something to do with his hands.
==> "As you see," Wolfe said, "I have - since you fancy clichés - an embarrassment of riches." His head tilted; I hadn’t sat. "Beer, please, Archie?" <==
"Yes, sir." I took a step and stopped. "Something wet, Mr. Vance?"
He shook his head and said emphatically, "No." I started out, foiled because a glass or bottle is a "best bet, and as I neared the door his voice stopped me. "What the hell. Scotch and water. And ice."
Fritz, having been told that he wouldn’t be needed, had gone out. In the kitchen I put Wolfe’s beer and glass on a tray, and on another tray a wiped glass, a bowl which I wiped before putting ice cubes in it, a pitcher which I wiped before putting water in it, and a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black which I also wiped. That took a while and made me miss something. When I got to the office with the trays Vance had used his hands some more and had a cigar lit, so I didn’t know if he carried them loose or in a case, or if he had used the matches on the stand. The cigar was a long panatela, nothing like a Gold Label Bonita, but that didn’t bother me; if he had left that case in the hit-and-run car it would have been common prudence to switch. After serving the trays I went back to the kitchen for a glass of milk and when I returned to the office Vance had his glass in his hand and Wolfe was talking.
"... for I have no intention or desire to make any demand or indictment, and I don’t think my client has either. I want only what I have been hired to get, information. I can’t name my client, but if my questions reveal her identity to you, that in itself would answer my basic question. The advertisement plainly implied that the woman once known as Carlotta Vaughn was later known as Elinor Denovo, but if you prefer to tell me nothing about Elinor Denovo we’ll restrict it to Carlotta Vaughn. By the way..."
He opened a drawer and took out the two photographs. I had cautioned him not to handle them in a way that would make it obvious that he was taking care not to leave prints - the Police Department files already had samples of his - and he did all right, perfectly normal as he handed them to me and I passed them on to

Ordinarily the sight of a pair of cops wanting in doesn’t scatter my wits, but as I started for the front I had room in my skull for only one item: the beautiful fact that the prints had matched and Floyd Vance had murdered Elinor Denovo. I should have realized that their coming twenty minutes before eleven o’clock, when they knew Wolfe wouldn’t be available, showed that it would take handling. Before I opened up I should have put the chain bolt on, holding the door to a two-inch crack, since it would have taken a warrant to open it legally and they wouldn’t have one, and we could discuss the situation. But I was so

 glad to see them that I swung the door wide, and I was probably showing my teeth in a big grin of welcome. If so, it soon went. They came in fast, Stebbins’ shoulder jostling me as he passed, headed for the rear, and started up the stairs.
A cop inside the house is a very different problem from one outside. Once he’s inside legally, and I had opened the door, about all you can do is sit down and write a letter to the Supreme Court. Even if I could beat them to the plant rooms, and I couldn’t, since the elevator was up there, what good would it do? I went to the kitchen to tell Fritz what had happened and that I was going up to join the party, and then took my time mounting the three flights.
To go through those three rooms, the cool, the moderate, and the warm, down the aisles between the benches, without being stopped by a color or a shape that you didn’t know existed, your mind must be fully occupied with something else. That time mine was. In the middle room I could already hear a voice, and when I opened the door to the warm room I could name it. Cramer. I walked the aisle and opened the door to the potting room, and there they were. Wolfe, in a yellow smock, was on his stool at the big bench. Theodore was standing over by the pot racks. Stebbins was off to the right. Cramer, in the center of the room, had his felt hat off and in his hand, I don’t know why. Facing Wolfe, he was telling him, louder than necessary, "...and hold you as material witnesses until we get warrants and then, by God, you go to a cell. All right, talk or move."
==> Wolfe stayed on the stool. His eyes came to me. "Any complaint, Archie?" "Only their bad manners. Next time they’ll talk through a crack." <==
His eyes moved. "Mr. Cramer. As I said, I will not talk business in this room. Not a word. If you’ll wait in my office I’ll be down at eleven o’clock. If you put hands on me, and Mr. Goodwin, and take us elsewhere, we’ll stand mute and communicate with our lawyer. When he comes we’ll confer with him privately, and the afternoon paper, the Gazette, and tomorrow morning’s papers, will publish the news that Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin have discovered the identity of the murderer of Elinor Denovo and have delivered satisfactory evidence to the police. Also, that in recognition of that public service they have been arrested and are behind bars, and their lawyer is arranging to secure their release on bail. Archie, here, please. This Miltonia charlesworthi germination card has conflicting entries. We’ll have to check it."
I went and took the card and scowled at it.


Cramer was in a box. My taking him the contents of those cartons and the letter, if the prints matched, certainly made us material witnesses, but if he herded us downtown and we performed as programmed by Wolfe, and we would, he would have to plug his ears for the horse laughs. If he and Stebbins waited there to go down to the office with us there was nowhere to sit, and standing around waiting may be all right for a sergeant but not for an inspector.

Stebbins muttered, apparently to himself, "God, I’d love to knock him off that stool." He looked at Cramer. "We take ‘em down and lock ‘em up and kick ‘em out before the lawyer comes."

, "I hadn’t opened the safe yet. Sorry."
Cramer about-faced and narrowed his eyes at me. Stebbins merely took more papers from a drawer and started leafing through them. A cop inside the house. The sound came of the elevator descending, and it stopped, and as Wolfe came I stepped into the office. He entered, halted, shot a glance at Cramer, glared at Stebbins, who went right on with papers, and said, "Get Mr. Parker. I’ll take it in the kitchen."
"What did you expect?" Cramer demanded. "Knock it off, Purley. Goodwin wants his chair. Come on, move!"
Stebbins tossed papers on my desk, a mess, got to his feet in no hurry, and went to get one of the yellow chairs. He likes to be with his back to a wall. By the time he had the chair where he wanted it Cramer was in the red leather chair and Wolfe, at his desk, had a drawer open to see if it was in order. He made a face and turned to Cramer. "The briefer we make this the better. You want to know who made those fingerprints."
"You’re damned right I do. And I want - "
==> "I know what you want, but something I want comes first. I will not have that man" - he aimed a straight finger at Stebbins - "in my house. Ransacking my office? Pfui. I would like to exclude you too, but someone even less tolerable would probably replace you. Archie. On a letterhead, Mr. Vance’s name and both addresses and telephone numbers. One carbon." <==
It took longer than usual to get paper and carbon in the typewriter on account of the mess Stebbins had made. As I typed Cramer said something, saw that Wolfe wasn’t listening and didn’t intend to, and shut his trap. As I rolled the paper out Wolfe said, "One to each," and I went and handed Cramer the original and Stebbins the carbon, and Wolfe told Cramer, "Get him out of here."
You have to admit that he knows when he can get away with what. In any ordinary circumstances he wouldn’t have tried telling Cramer to get Stebbins out of there, but I had just given him the name and address of a man who had left his cigar case in a hit-and-run car.
Cramer said to Wolfe, "Floyd Vance. Was it his prints on that stuff you sent me?"

 said, "Yes. He made most of them last evening, in my presence, and Mr. Goodwin’s, sitting in that chair."

I DIDN’T KNOW THEN, and I still don’t, exactly how long it took the city employees to find out why Floyd Vance killed Elinor Denovo. I mean really wrap it up. All I know is that Cramer’s phone call didn’t come until 6:38 p.m. Thursday, just in time to make me late at the poker party again. And I still didn’t know what the obvious step was. One of the eighty-seven facts about Wolfe that I would change if I knew how is that he doesn’t believe in talking merely to satisfy anyone’s curiosity, even mine. I admit that in this case there might have been other factors - for instance, he might have wanted to see if I would dope it out for myself and make some suggestions. You probably have, but maybe you wouldn’t if you had been in my shoes, waiting for a development which depended entirely on other people, and you didn’t know what they were doing and not doing.
I did do one thing. When I learned from the noon news broadcast on Wednesday that Floyd Vance was being held without bail, and rang Lon Cohen to check it, I phoned Lily Rowan to say I wanted to see the client and was invited to lunch; and after we had finished the lobster salad and cantaloupe mousse and had gone out’ to the terrace, I told Amy that there was no more danger of her being a special target and if she went out for a walk her chances of getting back in one

iece were as good as anybody else’s. Naturally she wanted to know what had happened, and Lily did too, and I think that was the first and only time that Lily suspected me of putting on an act in connection with my work. She remembered that she had a date, some kind of a committee meeting, which I doubted, and left me there with Amy. I admit she thought she was being considerate, but it was no favor to me. I had been stalling Amy for two weeks and she wanted to know, and I couldn’t blame her. Usually you can tell a client something, but I had already told her that her mother’s name was Carlotta Vaughn, and there was absolutely nothing that I was ready to add. When I left I wasn’t at all sure that I was still the one man in the world she could trust.
==> Of course I read every word in the Wednesday and Thursday papers about the hit-and-run driver the police had nabbed after three months, but learned nothing about motive. I got the impression that the fingerprints which had identified him had been secured by extremely competent detective work by the Homicide Bureau, but there were no published details about it. There was no mention of Nero Wolfe or Archie Goodwin. There was a lot of new information, new to me, about Floyd Vance, and one item cleared up a point that I had wondered about. In 1944 he had been in his late twenties and single, and why hadn’t he been sent, either to Europe or to Asia, to help several million of his fellow citizens do some expert handling of the public image of the United States of America? According to Wednesday’s Gazette and News, and Thursday’s Times, he had been excused because he had some kind of a trick knee. Other items, though they cleared up nothing, told me more about him - for instance, that he had always been a tadpole in a big frog pond as a public-relations counselor. Evidently he had had very little effect on the dignity of man, either way. <==
When the phone rang at 6:38 p.m. Thursday, I was at my desk working on germination records and Wolfe was at his with a book he had just started on, an advance copy of The Future of Germany, by Karl Jaspers. I reached for the receiver.
"Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie - "
"I want Wolfe, Goodwin. Cramer."
"Greetings." Without bothering to cover the transmitter, I turned my head and said, "Cramer," perhaps a little louder than usual, and Wolfe reached for his phone, perhaps a little faster than usual. I kept mine.

"About Floyd Vance. You read the papers." "Yes."

"I’ll hold the wire, but don’t keep me waiting."
I probably wasn’t breathing. It was a king-size gamble, and I was posting no odds. Too much depended on it. So the obvious step was drawing to what could be an inside straight. Not only was it possible that there was no close connection between Jarrett and Floyd Vance, and there was some other explanation for the checks Jarrett had sent, it was even conceivable that he had never heard of Floyd Vance. It could be that the next thing we would hear would be Oscar, if it was Oscar, hanging up.
But it wasn’t. I didn’t time it because I was hanging on a cliff, but I think it was about three hours. I mean three minutes.
"You’re interrupting my dinner." I nodded at Wolfe. It was him. "Mr. Jarrett?"
"Yes."
==> "My name is Nero Wolfe. I don’t like to interrupt any man’s meal, but it’s urgent. I have a decision to make that can’t be delayed. I just now conversed with the police officer who is in charge of the investigation of the murder of Elinor Denovo, and I can tell you in confidence that Mr. Archie Goodwin, who has been to see you twice, and I are responsible for the arrest of Floyd Vance as the culprit. To justify a charge of first-degree murder the police wish to establish a motive, arid it is manifest that it would help them to have your name so they can ask you about the association of Floyd Vance and Elinor Denovo twenty- three years ago. That would inevitably lead to your appearance on the witness stand at the trial of Floyd Vance, and I am reluctant to take the responsibility for exposing a man of your standing to such an ordeal. Before disclosing your name I would like to discuss the situation with you, and I’ll expect you here, at my office, at eleven o’clock tomorrow morning." <==
"Was my name mentioned in your talk with the police officer?"

 "No."
"I know nothing about the association of Floyd Vance and Elinor Denovo twenty-three years ago."
"Pfui. I’ll call Mr. McCray at once and advise him to make sure that certain checks in the files of the Seaboard Bank and Trust Company are not disturbed. If the police want them they can get a court order."

She leaned to get her eyes closer to the hole. "Won’t he see me?"
"No. From that side it’s just a picture."
She turned to me, "But why do ... What’s he going to say?"
"We’re waiting to hear him. Among other things he may tell us, and you, the name of your father. That may - "
The doorbell rang and I went, and it was Saul. I had told him what the program was and needed only to take him to the alcove and introduce him to the client who had paid him, through me, a little less than a grand in two weeks.
==> "Since you call me Archie," I told Amy, "you’ll have to call him Saul not to hurt his feelings. He’ll be here with you and if you get the idea that we’re not asking Jarrett the right questions and decide to come and help, Saul will block you. Jarrett must not suspect that he has any audience but Mr. Wolfe and me. Have your shoes off, and if you feel a cough or a sneeze coming, for God’s sake feel it soon enough to beat it to the kitchen." I looked at my watch. "He’s due in twenty-five minutes, but he’s driving ninety miles and he might be early. Saul will now take you to the kitchen for a coffee break. I’ll be in the office taking tranquilizers to steady my nerves." <==
"You won’t," Amy said.
"Then I won’t," I said, and left them. It would take Saul about five minutes to get acquainted with her.
There had been one big danger. A man of Jarrett’s position, financially and otherwise, might be able to put enough pressure on someone like the Police Commissioner or the Mayor or the New York Secretary of State, who issues private investigator licenses, to gag us. I blamed that fact, which had been on my

nd ever since Jarrett had hung up, for something that had happened Thursday evening, when I had let Lon Cohen rake in a fat pot without showing, though it was at least three to two that my tens would have taken it. But now, as eleven o’clock came closer and closer, that danger got slimmer and slimmer, and it looked surer and surer that Jarrett’s tie-in was so very personal that he couldn’t risk it.

Jarrett’s jaw had stopped working and the frozen eyes were leveled at Wolfe. "I asked her to," he said. "I continued to pay her. She was very competent and I thought she would put his business on a sound basis and straighten him out. He didn’t know she came from me. He knows nothing about me. My communications to him and about him have never been direct. My sending Carlotta Vaughn to him was a mistake. When I returned from abroad in September I learned what had happened. He had attracted her and seduced her and she was pregnant. By then she had returned to her senses. She stayed on with him for a month or so, out of stubbornness, hoping to make a man of a fool,

 but it was impossible, even for her. She left. She disappeared. I felt responsible, and I never slight a responsibility. I arranged to have her traced, but it took months, and I learned of her change of name in March nineteen forty-five. I arranged to keep informed, and was, and I sent her a check shortly after the birth of her child. I have not seen her or communicated with her since October nineteen forty-four. I am giving you details that make it unnecessary for you to ask questions. I have no knowledge of any contacts she may have had with Vance since October of nineteen forty-four. If he killed her I know nothing of his motive. I have never seen him or - " He stopped.
Wolfe asked, "Does he know he is your son?"
Jarrett was set for it and wasn’t fazed. "I’ve answered that," he said. "I said he knows nothing about me. You don’t merely assume that he is my son, you conclude it, because you can conceive of no other circumstance that would account for my taking the responsibility for Carlotta Vaughn’s misfortune. To deny it would be pointless; you wouldn’t believe me. If this Amy Denovo hires you to learn more about her father I know what you’ll do, and I’ve had enough of you. His mother’s name was Florence Vance. In nineteen fourteen she was twenty and I was twenty-three. She was a waitress in a restaurant in Boston. She died five days after the child was born. No; Floyd Vance does not know I am his father. If you have a material question ask it."
==> "There are many I could ask," Wolfe said, "but you have covered the essential points. It is only my curiosity that would be satisfied by knowing how you got word to Floyd Vance, two weeks ago, that I was looking for Amy Denovo’s father, and I can’t insist on that. I do have a comment. If you had told Mr. Goodwin when he first called on you what you have just told me, it is extremely likely that Floyd Vance would never have been identified as the murderer of Elinor Denovo. Also Amy Denovo’s problem would have been solved and she would not have to pay me for two weeks of strenuous effort. You say you never slight a responsibility. You are clearly responsible for the added strain and expense my client has had to bear. If you send me a check in payment for the work I have done for her, I will return the retainer she gave me and charge her nothing. Should you decide to do that, the amount is fifty thousand dollars. If you do, or if you don’t, it will add to my knowledge of my fellow man. Archie, that chair is hard to rise from. Mr. Jarrett may want your arm." <==
He didn’t. I went, but he ignored me. He pulled his feet in, swung his torso forward in a kind of lunge, and made it. The blue pill must have had something.

 I’ll say this for him, he never wasted words. No other man I had ever met would have simply let Wolfe’s comments ride, but he did. That was the third time I saw him make an abrupt exit, and the big difference was that the first two times the exit line had been his. Walking out, his step was surer than it had been coming in. I got to the hall ahead of him, and to the front door. When he appeared on the stoop the chauffeur opened the door of the Heron and crossed the sidewalk and started up, but Jarrett shook his head and made it down alone, and the chauffeur didn’t offer to help him in. Evidently he knew the signs.
As the Heron rolled I shut the door, went to the alcove, and said, "I hope you could hear all right. We can’t report or repeat anything."
Saul slid the panel shut. Amy, leaving the stool, misjudged the distance to the floor and landed off balance. I took her arm, and she said, "Thank you," politely. Her cheeks had less color than usual.

"There isn’t any dope, inside or outside. It’s hanging. But we’re not forgetting it."
"Right. I hope you get him. Nobody likes a hit-and-run."
Walking to Forty-third Street for the car, I had to concede that I had got no relief at all for the itch.
4
YOU WOULD SUPPOSE THAT at ten minutes to ten Monday morning, as I sat in a taxicab headed uptown, with the box on the seat beside me and the breast pocket of my jacket bulging with envelopes containing letters to twelve savings banks because I never lug a brief case if I can help it, my mind would be on the morning’s program, but it wasn’t. It was on the hour just past, or part of it, instead of the one just ahead. I don’t like to have people bellow at me, particularly not Wolfe.
==> Also I had had only six hours’ sleep, a full two hours less than I need and nearly always get. Getting home after midnight Sunday, I had decided against typing twelve letters before turning in, and so had to set the alarm for seven o’clock. When it went off I opened one eye to glare at it, but I knew I would have to hustle, much as I hate hustling before breakfast, and in six minutes, maybe seven, I was on my feet. At 7:45 I was at the little table in the kitchen where I eat breakfast, on the last swallow of orange juice, and Fritz was crossing to me with the grilled ham and corn fritters, and at 8:10 I was in the office at the typewriter. At 9:15 I had finished the twelfth letter and had started folding and putting them in envelopes when the doorbell rang, and I went to the hall for a look through the one-way glass in the front door, and saw a big burly male with a big round red face topped by a big battered broad-brimmed felt hat. The hat alone would have been enough. Inspector Cramer of Homicide South must be the only man in New York who wears such a hat on a hot sunny day in August. <==
Nuts, I thought, let him ring. But it must be just for me, since he knew Wolfe was never available before eleven o’clock, so I went and opened the door and

 said, "Good morning and greetings, but I’m busy and I’m in a rush. I really mean it."
"So am I." It was gruff, but it always is. "I’m just stopping by on my way down. Why did you call Stebbins on that hit-and-run?"
"What the hell, I told him why."

"What the hell, I told him why."
"I know you did. Also I know you and I know Wolfe. Discussing crime my ass. All right, discuss it with me now. I want to know why you’re working on that hit-and-run."
"I’m not. Mr. Wolfe isn’t." I glanced at my wrist. "I would like to ask you in for some give and take, you know I enjoy that, but I’ve got a date. Except for what was in the papers, I know absolutely nothing about that hit-and-run, and neither does Mr. Wolfe. No one has consulted with us about it. The only client we’ve got is a girl who can’t find her father and wants us to." I glanced at my wrist. "Damn it, I’ll be late." I started the door around. He opened his mouth, clamped it shut, about-faced, and started down the seven steps of the stoop. His PD car was there, double-parked. By the time he reached it I was back in the office.
==> Time was short, but it was quite possible that Cramer would phone while I was gone, and Wolfe didn’t know about my call to Purley Stebbins. He is not to be disturbed short of an emergency when he is up in the plant rooms, but he had to be told, so I took the house phone and pushed a button, and after a wait his voice came. <==
"Yes?"
"Me in a hurry. Cramer was here just now, stopping on his way downtown. I
haven’t had a chance to tell you that Saturday afternoon I rang Stebbins and - " "I’m busy!" he bellowed and hung up.
I assumed he had just found a thrip on a favorite plant or dry rot on a pseudobulb, but as I said, I do not like to be bellowed at. If Cramer called they could discuss crime. When the letters were in the envelopes and in my pocket I still had a chore left, ringing Mortimer M.

 depositor - not me, Nero Wolfe - whose balance never went below five figures and sometimes hit six. That done, I got the box from the safe and was off. Nothing was in it but the money; the letter was on a shelf with some other classified items.
At the Eighty-sixth Street branch I found that Hotchkiss had been prompt. I was only six steps inside when a man at a desk got up and motioned me over and asked if I was Mr. Goodwin, and then took me inside the rail and along an aisle to a door at the front. He opened it and bowed me in, and there was Amy Denovo on a chair facing a big glass-topped desk. Behind the desk was a middle-aged banker with a shiny dome and rimless cheaters. As I crossed he rose and offered a hand, saying that it was a pleasure, Mr. Goodwin, a real pleasure, which was par, since Hotchkiss was a vice-president and he wasn’t. I said, "Mr. Atwood?" and he said yes and told me to sit, but after telling Amy good morning I put the box on the desk, fished the key from my pocket and used it, and opened the lid wide. Then I sat Atwood had started to, but was up again, staring at the contents of the box. It rated a stare, even from a banker.

That’s two hundred and forty-four thousand dollars, all in centuries. Miss Denovo would like to have twelve bank checks for twenty grand each, payable to her, and the remaining four grand deposited in her account."
"Certainly," he said. He looked at her and back at me. "That’s quite a ... quite a ... certainly. Do you want ... it will take a while, a little while - counting it and making out the checks."

I told her nothing was the matter, just the contrary; we had just got a break I would explain later.
The rest of the errand at the bank was merely routine. At eleven o’clock Amy and I were sitting at a table in a drugstore on Madison Avenue, her with coffee and me with a glass of milk. The twelve letters had been dropped into a mailbox at the corner and the empty box was beside me on a chair. I had told her why I had shushed her at the bank, and about the break, of course not mentioning Ballou’s name, and had offered to bet her a finif that we would spot her father within three days, but she said she wouldn’t bet against what she wanted. At 11:10 I said I had to make a phone call, went to the booth, dialed the number I knew best, and after eight rings got what I expected.

"Yes?"
He knows darned well that’s no way to answer a phone, but try to change him.
==> "Me," I said. "In a drugstore with the client, having refreshments. The letters have been mailed, with enclosures, and she is taking the box home as a souvenir of her mother or father, I don’t know which. Three items. First, what I started to tell you this morning when you bellowed at me. Cramer may phone, so you ought to know that I rang Stebbins Saturday afternoon. I told him that you and I were discussing crime the other day and the hit-and-run that killed a woman named Elinor Denovo came up, and I wondered if they had got a lead. He told Cramer, and of course Cramer thinks that the simplest question from you or me means that we’ve got something hot. I told him that we only knew what we read in the papers. If he phones, you - " <==
"Pfui. What else?"
"Second, you said Friday evening that my next stop after the bank would be Raymond Thorne. Any change?"
"No."
"Third, the bank was pie. The checks were drawn by the Seaboard Bank and Trust Company, the third largest bank in town, payable to bearer, and I took a look at it in the International Bank Directory. I won’t mention his name on the phone, but you remember that one winter evening about a year and a half ago a man sat in the office and said to you, quote, ‘I have never spent an hour in a pink bedroom,’ end quote. Well, he’s on the Board of Directors of the Seaboard Bank and Trust Company."
"Indeed." A five-second pause. "Satisfactory."

 holding or talking. "This is Nero Wolfe. Yes, Mr. Jarrett?"
"I have your letter. I’ll come around six."
"Good. As I said in the letter, I’ll appreciate it. I’ll expect you."
They hung up together. There was a case where the approach took five minutes and the meet about ten seconds. A piece by a scientist in the Sunday New York Times Magazine which I had read during the weekend had explained why this is the age of instant communication.
==> There were some items in the morning mail that needed attention, or at least got it, but we were interrupted a few times by phone calls: from Saul, who had drawn nothing but blanks; from Fred, who had found three people who had recognized the photographs but hadn’t been any help; and from Orrie, from Washington, who had verified most of Jarrett’s places and dates and was working on the rest. The hospital part, which covered most of July, was airtight. You are probably thinking that the client was getting damned little for her money, and I agree. When I returned from a trip to the mailbox at the corner it was lunchtime, and as we crossed to the dining room Wolfe said something about Mr. Cramer and I asked if he had phoned. Wolfe said no, he had come, late Saturday afternoon. <==
I was sorry I had missed it because talk by those two is always worth hearing. You get good examples of how much a man can say in a few words and also of how little he can say in a lot of words. So back in the office after lunch I said I would just as soon know what Cramer had wanted, and Wolfe said only what he always wanted, information; he had said nothing that would help us any.
I settled back and crossed my legs. "I haven’t kept count," I said, "but at least a thousand times I have given you a verbatim report of a conversation. I can’t tell you to because I don’t pay you, you pay me, but I can suggest it. I am suggesting it."
A corner of his mouth went up a sixteenth of an inch. For him it was a broad smile. "My memory is as good as yours, Archie."
"Then it would be no strain. I said verbatim."
"I know you did." He squinted at me. "Well ... Mr. Cramer, admitted by Fritz,

Lon Cohen knew absolutely nothing about him, and neither did a couple of others on the Gazette that he got on the phone.

At the Times there was another reply, also impossible, and nothing in the morgue about Eugene Jarrett except such routine facts as that he graduated from Harvard in 1945 and he had been a sponsor of a dinner to honor somebody in 1963. The biggest blank was the New York public library, where I got stubborn and spent a full hour. You wouldn’t believe that after all that expert research I didn’t even know whether that vice-president of the third largest bank in New York had any children or not, when I returned to the old brownstone a little before six o’clock. But I didn’t. I had supposed, when I left, that I would have to get back in time to go up to the plant rooms to brief Wolfe on him before he came, but it wasn’t even worth buzzing him on the house phone. When he came down I told him that we would learn more about Eugene Jarrett in one glance at him than I had learned all afternoon, and the doorbell rang.

He shook his head but didn’t open his eyes. "I am making assumptions. I am assuming that Miss Denovo’s father murdered her mother; that it is more feasible to find him as a murderer than as a father, since he became a father twenty-two years ago and became a murderer only three months ago; that some recent event supplied the motive for the murder; and that the most likely person to have knowledge of that event is Raymond Thorne or someone in his employ who was closely associated with Elinor Denovo." His eyes opened. "I’ll start with Mr. Thorne."
I put the glass with what was left of the Irish on my desk. "Holy heaven. That’s the wildest goose you ever chased."
"Perhaps. Sitting here hour after hour and day after day getting futile reports from you and Saul and Fred and Orrie is affecting my appetite and my palate. This morning I had to read a page twice. Intolerable. Can you have Mr. Thorne here at six o’clock?"
"I can try. Is this just a spasm or do you mean it?"
"I don’t have spasms."
==> "We can discuss that some other time. I have a suggestion. You may remember my saying Monday afternoon that Cramer wouldn’t be bothering about a three- months-old hit-and-run unless it had some special kink. It might help to know what it is. I request permission to go and ask him." <==
"Why should he tell you?"


"Leave that, quoting you, to my intelligence guided by experience." "You can’t give him the client’s name."
"Certainly not. But he probably knows it, after that ad."

"Leave that, quoting you, to my intelligence guided by experience." "You can’t give him the client’s name."
"Certainly not. But he probably knows it, after that ad."
"Very well. First, Mr. Thorne."
==> It took nearly an hour to get Raymond Thorne because he was somewhere watching TV cameras make a Raymond Thorne production, and when I finally had him he said he couldn’t possibly make it at six o’clock. I reminded him that he had told me he would like to help Amy any way he could, and he said he would come at nine. Getting Inspector Cramer was easier and quicker. He was at his office and would see me. Wolfe had gone up to the plant rooms and I went to the kitchen to tell Fritz I was leaving. <==
The cop at the top of Homicide South could surely have had a bigger room and a bigger desk and better chairs for visitors than the setup on West Twentieth Street, but Cramer liked to stick to things he was used to, including that old felt hat, which was always there on a corner of his desk when it wasn’t on his head, although there was a rack only a step away. I sat on the wooden chair at the end of his desk while he finished with a folder he was going through. When he closed it and turned to me, I said, "I bring hot news. We’re working on that hit- and-run. Mr. Wolfe thought we should tell you because we said we weren’t."
He put on an act. He demanded, "What hit-and-run?"
"On May twenty-sixth, nineteen sixty-seven, a woman named Elinor Denovo was crossing Eighty-second Street and - "
"Oh, yes. So you’re working on it. So Wolfe wants to know something, so he sends you. He can go to hell."
I nodded. "So you would like to know what he wants to know, so you let me in when you’re busy. I’ll make it brief and answer questions within reason. What we told you was the truth and the whole truth: our only client was and is a woman who wants us to find her father, whom she has never seen. She doesn’t know who or what he was or is, and she wants to. We have smoked out three different Grade A leads, but they have all fizzled. Two full weeks, and we have a load of nothing, either for the client or for you. So an hour ago Mr. Wolfe

"You had phoned Stebbins. You know damned well that when I find Wolfe within a mile I smell a rat. I thought - "
"Do I tell him you called him a rat?"
"You do not. He’s a lot of things I can name, but he’s not a rat. I thought he might be able to name a man who smokes a certain kind of cigar."
"I know one who smokes Monte Cristos. He gets them from a purser on a ship."
"Yeah. You’ll clown while they’re embalming you. If you want an interesting fact off the record, we’ve got one we’ve been saving, but hell, we might as well put it on television. We’ve got nine fingerprints of that hit-and-run driver, and six of them are as good as you could want."
==> The door opened and a uniformed city employee entered, came, and put an old scarred wooden tray on Cramer’s desk blotter. As Cramer nodded thanks and picked up the pot to pour, I asked, "Didn’t the damn fool ever hear of gloves?" <==


He put the pot down. "They weren’t on the car. On the floor, in front, was a leather cigar case. He got it out to light one while he was parked on Second Avenue waiting for her, and there she came, and he dropped it on the seat..."
My brows were up. "You’re saying it was first-degree."
He took a healthy swallow of coffee. I have to sip when it’s that hot. "Wolfe is," he said, "not me. I was doing him a favor, reconstructing it for him. I don’t give a damn how he happened to leave it; we’ve got it. But we can’t match the prints - here, Washington, London - nowhere. There were two cigars in the case. Gold Label Bonitas. Knowing, as I do, the kind of stunts Wolfe is capable of, it was possible he was getting set to ask me if I would care to meet a man who smoked Gold Label Bonitas and was shy a case to carry them in." He drank coffee.

"If the case is handy," I said, "I would enjoy looking at it. So I could describe it to Mr. Wolfe."
"It’s at the laboratory. It’s polished black calfskin, not new but not worn much, stamped on the inside ‘Corwin Deluxe.’ No other marks. Nothing special about it to trace."
"I suppose the woman who owned the car - "
==> The door was opening and a cop stepped in. Cramer asked him, "Yes?" and he said Sergeant So-and-so had arrived with What’s-his-name, and I stood up. It would have been a dumb remark anyway. They have some darned smart dicks at Homicide South, and one of them had certainly asked the owner of the car if the cigar case was hers. <==

RAYMOND THORNE WAS MORE than half an hour late. It was 9:40 when the doorbell rang and I went and admitted him, took him to the office, introduced him, nodded him to the red leather chair, asked him what he would like to drink, and went to the kitchen to fill his order for brandy and a glass of water.
When the three ‘teers had phoned in with their usual reports, nothing, they had been told to call at nine in the morning. They were the three ‘teers because once

 at a conference Orrie had said they were the three musketeers and we had tried to change it to fit. We tried snoopeteers, privateers (for private eyes), dicketeers, wolf steers, hawketeers, and others, and ended up by deciding that none of them was good enough and settling for the three ‘teers. They had not been told that we were now looking for a murderer, not just a father; I saved that for morning so they would get a good night’s sleep.

 is a long time and it might not prove anything. Of course the receptionist at Thorne’s could settle it that it was the public-relations Floyd Vance that she shooed out that May day, but that would only prove that it’s a real nibble."
I put the snifter to my lips and tilted my head back enough to get a good gulp. Wolfe, having waited until the bead was down to precisely the right level, raised his glass.
"Fingerprints," I said.
"Yes," he said.
==> "We get his and give them to Cramer and they match or they don’t." <==
"No." He licked foam from his lips. "If they matched we’d be in a fix. Mr. Cramer would have a murderer, but we would still need a father, and he would be locked up and inaccessible. You said he wanted to meet me."
"Yeah. If he’s it, what he really wanted was to find out if we had got anywhere and if so how far. How he knew we were on it is a question, but we don’t have to answer it. Sure, I could get him here, and then what? Do you think you could ask him anything that would help without giving him a guess that we’re on him? I don’t. There would be the same risk in seeing the receptionist at Thorne’s. She might tell him."
He poured beer, leaned back and closed his eyes, and pushed his lips out. He pulled them in and pushed them out again. That was a new one; it had never happened before. The lip act, leaning back and closing his eyes and working his lips out and in, was routine; that meant he was working, working hard, and interruptions were not allowed. But that was the first time he had ever started it with beer just poured, and how would he handle it? How would he know when the bead was down to the right level with his eyes shut? By God, he did. When it was down to where it would just cover his lips as he drank, he opened his eyes, reached for the glass, drank, put the glass down, leaned back, closed his eyes, licked the foam off, and sent his lips out and in. I decided he must have practiced it when I wasn’t around.
I usually time the lip act, since there’s nothing else to do except try to guess what he’ll come up with. That time it was three minutes and ten seconds. He opened his eyes, straightened up, and asked, "They’re coming at nine o’clock?"

He frowned. "I don’t talk in quotations, even Shakespeare, and neither do you."

Miss Rowan does sometimes and she likes that one. As you see, I am no longer on daylight saving. Apparently you are." He was fully dressed: a nice clean yellow shirt with narrow maroon stripes, a maroon tie, and a brown summerweight self-striped suit. Up in the plant rooms he would shed the jacket and put on a smock.
He swallowed a bite of egg and said, "It’s nearly nine o’clock."
"By daylight saving, yes, sir. I’ll brief them while I’m eating breakfast."
==> "Only Saul. We won’t risk it with Fred and Orrie. Tell them to be on call. You and Saul will decide on your approach and you may need them later. First, is he involved? If yes, merely as the murderer, with a motive that doesn’t concern us, or also as the father? We can’t waste our time and the client’s money just on finding a culprit for Mr. Cramer." He dropped toast in the sauce. <==
"I’m waking up," I said. "Or I got ideas in my sleep. Last night I said we don’t have to answer the question how he knew we were on it, but if he’s the father it may be important. If he’s the father there’s some connection between him and Cyrus Jarrett, or why did Jarrett send the checks? And if Jarrett told him that Nero Wolfe is out to find the father, and if he is also the murderer, what about Miss Denovo? We might lose a client. I doubt if you want another casualty like Simon Jacobs on the record, and I certainly don’t. I suggest that we’d better get her out of circulation."
He made a face. "Fritz."
That was what he calls flummery. It was true that when, for security reasons, it had been necessary to have a female guest sleeping and eating in the South Room, which is above Wolfe’s, Fritz hadn’t been able to hide how he felt about it, but Wolfe hadn’t even tried to hide how he felt.
"I’m aware," I said, "that if we did it again Fritz might leave and you might too. I don’t mean here. She spends most of her days at Miss Rowan’s, and she could spend her nights there too until we get him or drop him. Miss Rowan has two spare rooms. I’ll suggest it. Anything else?"
He said no and I went back up a flight to do in ten minutes what usually takes me thirty. By the time I got down to the kitchen, having stopped in the office to tell Fred and Orrie that Saul and I were going to pick up a trail and might need them later, my fog was starting to clear.

"It was about time," I said with feeling. "Questions." His eyes opened. "Why roses?"
I nodded. "I expected that. It came out without thinking, probably because she had struck me as not the type for orchids. She could probably get a lot more for Nero Wolfe orchids than for run-of-the-nursery roses."
"We’ll send her some sprays of Phalaenopsis Aphrodite. They have never been finer. Having had time to consider it, you regard the job as finished?"
"I was just smacking my lips after so many hungry days. One will get you fifty that Floyd Vance is the father, but I admit it wouldn’t be enough for a jury. It might be enough for the client, but I also admit there are other angles."
"Specify them."
==> "Well. The angle most important to us is your honor. Four days ago I said to Cramer, ‘I am authorized to give you Mr. Wolfe’s word of honor that if we get anything you might be able to use we’ll pass it on to you before we make any use of it ourselves.’ I added, ‘At least two minutes before,’ but that didn’t cancel the commitment. We now have these items: One: Carlotta Vaughn became pregnant in the summer of nineteen forty-four and almost certainly wasn’t married. Two: she spent the entire summer of nineteen forty-four in close association with Floyd Vance. Three: on Monday, May twenty-second, nineteen sixty-seven, four days before Carlotta Vaughn, who was then Elinor Denovo, died, Floyd Vance tried to see her and was chased by the receptionist, and he had been trying to see her before. I’d hate to undertake to tell Cramer that those three items, taken together, are not something he might be able to use. Of course your honor is your lookout, but I mortgaged it." <==
He grunted. "My lookout and my responsibility. Go on."
"Then the angle that may interest me more than it does you. My honor isn’t involved, but my feelings are, because I got my ass kicked twice by Cyrus M.

Jarrett and I would like to return the compliment. What kind of a connection was there, and is there, between Jarrett and Vance that caused Jarrett to start sending checks to Carlotta Vaughn, alias Elinor Denovo, two weeks after her baby was born and to keep on sending them until her death? That could be another item that Cramer might be able to use, but that’s not why I want to know. Also, of course, Miss Denovo would like to know. I believe in satisfying the client. I also believe in satisfying me. All right, I withdraw my brag; the job is not finished. It’s your move."
I expected him to start the lip act, but he merely cocked his head. "The point," he said, "is that we don’t know which of two alternative situations faces us. If he is the father but not a murderer, establishing it will be difficult if not impossible. He did that many years ago. But if he is also a murderer the situation is much simpler; he did that only three months ago. We’ll resolve that and then decide how to proceed. Can you get him here this evening?"

"For what? Do I ask him if he still wants to meet you?"
"That would do to start. If he says no, tell him I want to meet him. Tell him I want to ask him why he didn’t reply to the advertisement requesting information about Carlotta Vaughn, alias Elinor Denovo."
I had noted the listing of Vance’s home phone, but got the directory to check on the number, and found that my memory had it right. It was a quarter to seven when I dialed, and if he ate out I would probably get no answer. But after two rings I got a hello.
"Mr. Floyd Vance, please?" "I’m Floyd Vance."

"Balls. I’ve heard enough of you. You’re a pair of goddam loudmouths." It wasn’t as easy as falling off a log to rise from that chair, and four of his fingertips pressed against the leather arm as he used leverage. When he was erect he told me to go do something, still another vulgar cliché, and I moved to get to the hall ahead of him; he might turn left instead of right, and Wolfe was in the kitchen. I didn’t go to the front to open the door for him. Not because he was a liar; it just didn’t seem to be called for.
When the door had shut behind him, with a bang, I went and opened the kitchen door enough to call through, "Company’s gone!" and then to the stairs down to the basement storeroom for empty cartons and tissue paper and twine.
When I got back up to the office, loaded, Wolfe was standing at the end of his desk, frowning around at everything in sight. I put the cartons down on the couch and the paper and twine on my desk, and said, "I wouldn’t trade images with that specimen, public or private. I have never felt so sorry for a client. If she had known what she was going to get for her twenty grand ..."

He growled. "How long will that cigar smoke last?"
==> "The air conditioner will do it in about an hour." I was gently wrapping in tissue paper the glass that had held Scotch. "I need your help on a decision. The bottle is more than half full of Johnnie Walker Black. About six dollars’ worth. Do we donate it to Cramer or do I empty it?" <==
"Empty it hi the sink. It’s contaminated. Confound this smell. I’m going upstairs, but there’s a letter to write. Your notebook."
I went and sat, and for the first tune in I don’t know how long he dictated a letter standing.
"Dear Mr. Cramer: Five days ago you told Mr. Goodwin you had in your possession a leather cigar case front which you had taken nine fingerprints. Period. The cartons he will deliver to you with this letter contain an assortment of objects, comma, some of which may have on them fingerprints which may possibly match those you secured from the cigar case. Period. This is merely a conjecture, comma, and I shall be obliged if you will tell me whether it is valid. Sincerely yours. Fritz can bring it up with my breakfast for my signature. By the time you and Saul finish here I may be asleep."
He pinched his nose, told me good night, and headed for the door.

WHEN I ARRIVED AT the headquarters of Homicide South on West Twentieth Street at a quarter to nine Tuesday morning, I was on the fence. I wanted the cartons to get to Cramer as soon as possible, but if he was there I didn’t want to deliver them to him myself, because as soon as he read the letter I would be stuck. He would hold me until the prints had been lifted and compared, and if they matched I would be held tighter and longer. So I was just as well pleased that he hadn’t come yet. Neither had Purley Stebbins, but I got a sergeant I knew named Berman. When he saw the six cartons, one big enough to hold a wastebasket, which was one of the items Saul had brought from 490 Lexington Avenue, he said he hoped it wasn’t all bombs and I said no, only one was, and the trick was to guess which. He put the letter in his pocket and promised to give it to Cramer as soon as he came.

t would be instructive to report how Saul got a big wastebasket out of that office building at ten o’clock at night, but it would take a page.

t would be instructive to report how Saul got a big wastebasket out of that office building at ten o’clock at night, but it would take a page.
Home again, having had only orange juice before leaving, I ate breakfast, tried to find something in the Times that deserved attention, and expected. The trouble with expecting is that you always jump the gun. It could take anywhere from one to eight hours for them to get the prints lifted and compared, but as I went to the office to dust and tear pages from desk calendars and put fresh water in the vase on Wolfe’s desk and open the mail, I was expecting the phone to ring any minute. You simply can’t help it, especially when you have no good reason to bet a dime either way on what you’re expecting. If the fingerprints didn’t match we were left with a Grade A mess and no way on earth of making a neat package of it to deliver to the client; if they did match we could take our pick of three or four different ways to play it and they all looked good. So I expected, and although I opened the mail and gave it a look before putting it under the chunk of jade on Wolfe’s desk, I had no clear idea what was in it. One thing, not in the mail, did get some real attention. Saul and I had decided that we almost certainly had enough without lifting the prints from the red leather chair. We had got bed sheets from the closet and draped them over it, and there it was, and it looked pretty silly. I removed the sheets, folded them, and put them back in the closet. What the hell, as Amy’s father would say, I was there on guard. Returning to the office, I looked at my watch for about the tenth time since breakfast, saw that it was 10:38, and decided it was time to consider it calmly and realistically. To begin with, if the prints didn’t match there was nothing to expect. Some detective second grade would phone in a day or two to tell me to come and get the junk I had left there. If they did match the best guess was that Lieutenant Rowcliff or Sergeant Stebbins would phone around two or three o’clock and tell me they wanted me there quick. Or possibly -
The doorbell rang and I went to the hall and saw Cramer and Stebbins on the stoop.
Ordinarily the sight of a pair of cops wanting in doesn’t scatter my wits, but as I started for the front I had room in my skull for only one item: the beautiful fact that the prints had matched and Floyd Vance had murdered Elinor Denovo. I should have realized that their coming twenty minutes before eleven o’clock, when they knew Wolfe wouldn’t be available, showed that it would take handling. Before I opened up I should have put the chain bolt on, holding the door to a two-inch crack, since it would have taken a warrant to open it legally and they wouldn’t have one, and we could discuss the situation.

WHEN I ARRIVED AT the headquarters of Homicide South on West Twentieth Street at a quarter to nine Tuesday morning, I was on the fence. I wanted the cartons to get to Cramer as soon as possible, but if he was there I didn’t want to deliver them to him myself, because as soon as he read the letter I would be stuck. He would hold me until the prints had been lifted and compared, and if they matched I would be held tighter and longer. So I was just as well pleased that he hadn’t come yet. Neither had Purley Stebbins, but I got a sergeant I knew named Berman. When he saw the six cartons, one big enough to hold a wastebasket, which was one of the items Saul had brought from 490 Lexington Avenue, he said he hoped it wasn’t all bombs and I said no, only one was, and the trick was to guess which. He put the letter in his pocket and promised to give it to Cramer as soon as he came.

Before I opened up I should have put the chain bolt on, holding the door to a two-inch crack, since it would have taken a warrant to open it legally and they wouldn’t have one, and we could discuss the situation. But I was so

 glad to see them that I swung the door wide, and I was probably showing my teeth in a big grin of welcome. If so, it soon went. They came in fast, Stebbins’ shoulder jostling me as he passed, headed for the rear, and started up the stairs.
A cop inside the house is a very different problem from one outside. Once he’s inside legally, and I had opened the door, about all you can do is sit down and write a letter to the Supreme Court. Even if I could beat them to the plant rooms, and I couldn’t, since the elevator was up there, what good would it do? I went to the kitchen to tell Fritz what had happened and that I was going up to join the party, and then took my time mounting the three flights.
To go through those three rooms, the cool, the moderate, and the warm, down the aisles between the benches, without being stopped by a color or a shape that you didn’t know existed, your mind must be fully occupied with something else. That time mine was. In the middle room I could already hear a voice, and when I opened the door to the warm room I could name it. Cramer. I walked the aisle and opened the door to the potting room, and there they were. Wolfe, in a yellow smock, was on his stool at the big bench. Theodore was standing over by the pot racks. Stebbins was off to the right. Cramer, in the center of the room, had his felt hat off and in his hand, I don’t know why. Facing Wolfe, he was telling him, louder than necessary, "...and hold you as material witnesses until we get warrants and then, by God, you go to a cell. All right, talk or move."

Wolfe stayed on the stool. His eyes came to me. "Any complaint, Archie?" "Only their bad manners. Next time they’ll talk through a crack."
His eyes moved. "Mr. Cramer. As I said, I will not talk business in this room. Not a word. If you’ll wait in my office I’ll be down at eleven o’clock. If you put hands on me, and Mr. Goodwin, and take us elsewhere, we’ll stand mute and communicate with our lawyer. When he comes we’ll confer with him privately, and the afternoon paper, the Gazette, and tomorrow morning’s papers, will publish the news that Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin have discovered the identity of the murderer of Elinor Denovo and have delivered satisfactory evidence to the police.

I went and took the card and scowled at it.

Cramer was in a box. My taking him the contents of those cartons and the letter, if the prints matched, certainly made us material witnesses, but if he herded us downtown and we performed as programmed by Wolfe, and we would, he would have to plug his ears for the horse laughs. If he and Stebbins waited there to go down to the office with us there was nowhere to sit, and standing around waiting may be all right for a sergeant but not for an inspector.
Stebbins muttered, apparently to himself, "God, I’d love to knock him off that stool." He looked at Cramer. "We take ‘em down and lock ‘em up and kick ‘em out before the lawyer comes."

Actually Cramer is not a fool, not at all. Stebbins must have sold him the bright idea of coming before eleven and invading the plant rooms. He jerked his head and a hand toward the door, an order, and the sergeant obeyed. He stepped to the door and opened it, and when Cramer was through he followed him, leaving the door wide open. Theodore went and shut it, and Wolfe looked at the electric clock which controlled the temperature and some of the ventilation. It was six minutes to eleven.
I asked, "Is this card really off?"
"No. Stay here." He turned to Theodore. "Those Odontoglossum pyramus aren’t ready for sevens: Put them in sixes. Do you agree?"
"No," Theodore said. "A little extra room won’t hurt them any."

I had to stay, of course, not only because Wolfe had told me to; if I had followed them down they would have started in on me and I might overdo it, the way I felt.

They would probably be expecting us to come down together in the elevator, so when Wolfe left the stool and unbuttoned the smock I said I would take the stairs and went. Since all three flights are carpeted, noise was no problem, and they didn’t even know I was there, in the office doorway, until I spoke. Stebbins was seated at my desk, with two drawers open, and Cramer was over by the cabinets but with none of them open because they had locks.

Cramer about-faced and narrowed his eyes at me. Stebbins merely took more papers from a drawer and started leafing through them. A cop inside the house. The sound came of the elevator descending, and it stopped, and as Wolfe came I stepped into the office. He entered, halted, shot a glance at Cramer, glared at Stebbins, who went right on with papers, and said, "Get Mr. Parker. I’ll take it in the kitchen."
"What did you expect?" Cramer demanded. "Knock it off, Purley. Goodwin wants his chair. Come on, move!"

Stebbins tossed papers on my desk, a mess, got to his feet in no hurry, and went to get one of the yellow chairs. He likes to be with his back to a wall. By the time he had the chair where he wanted it Cramer was in the red leather chair and Wolfe, at his desk, had a drawer open to see if it was in order. He made a face and turned to Cramer. "The briefer we make this the better. You want to know who made those fingerprints."

"You’re damned right I do. And I want - "
"I know what you want, but something I want comes first. I will not have that man" - he aimed a straight finger at Stebbins - "in my house. Ransacking my office? Pfui. I would like to exclude you too, but someone even less tolerable would probably replace you. Archie. On a letterhead, Mr. Vance’s name and both addresses and telephone numbers. One carbon."
It took longer than usual to get paper and carbon in the typewriter on account of the mess Stebbins had made. As I typed Cramer said something, saw that Wolfe wasn’t listening and didn’t intend to, and shut his trap. As I rolled the paper out Wolfe said, "One to each," and I went and handed Cramer the original and Stebbins the carbon, and Wolfe told Cramer, "Get him out of here."

Stebbins was seated at my desk, with two drawers open, and Cramer was over by the cabinets but with none of them open because they had locks.

, "I hadn’t opened the safe yet. Sorry."
Cramer about-faced and narrowed his eyes at me. Stebbins merely took more papers from a drawer and started leafing through them. A cop inside the house. The sound came of the elevator descending, and it stopped, and as Wolfe came I stepped into the office. He entered, halted, shot a glance at Cramer, glared at Stebbins, who went right on with papers, and said, "Get Mr. Parker. I’ll take it in the kitchen."
==> "What did you expect?" Cramer demanded. "Knock it off, Purley. Goodwin wants his chair. Come on, move!" <==
Stebbins tossed papers on my desk, a mess, got to his feet in no hurry, and went to get one of the yellow chairs. He likes to be with his back to a wall. By the time he had the chair where he wanted it Cramer was in the red leather chair and Wolfe, at his desk, had a drawer open to see if it was in order. He made a face and turned to Cramer. "The briefer we make this the better. You want to know who made those fingerprints."
"You’re damned right I do. And I want - "
"I know what you want, but something I want comes first. I will not have that man" - he aimed a straight finger at Stebbins - "in my house. Ransacking my office? Pfui. I would like to exclude you too, but someone even less tolerable would probably replace you. Archie. On a letterhead, Mr. Vance’s name and both addresses and telephone numbers. One carbon."
It took longer than usual to get paper and carbon in the typewriter on account of the mess Stebbins had made. As I typed Cramer said something, saw that Wolfe wasn’t listening and didn’t intend to, and shut his trap. As I rolled the paper out Wolfe said, "One to each," and I went and handed Cramer the original and Stebbins the carbon, and Wolfe told Cramer, "Get him out of here."
You have to admit that he knows when he can get away with what. In any ordinary circumstances he wouldn’t have tried telling Cramer to get Stebbins out of there, but I had just given him the name and address of a man who had left his cigar case in a hit-and-run car.

The air conditioning had dried the sweat on Cramer’s forehead and taken some of the red from his face. "I want plenty," he said. "I want one good reason why you and Goodwin shouldn’t be charged with withholding information of a crime and obstructing justice. I want to know how long you have known that this Floyd Vance was the driver of that hit-and-run car, and how you spotted him. I want to know if he’s the father you said you were looking for, and if so, and Elinor Denovo was the mother, I want to know why he killed her."
"That will take a lot of talking, Mr. Cramer." "It sure will. Even for you. Go right ahead."
Wolfe adjusted his bulk in the chair. "First, withholding information. Last Thursday Mr. Goodwin gave you our word that if we got anything you might be able to use we would pass it on to you before we made any use of it ourselves. We got those fingerprints late last evening and delivered them to you early this morning, and we have made no use of them and don’t intend to. I have no other information that you might be able to use, in my judgment."

"If you please. You told me to talk. As I told you, my client was, and is, a young woman who hired me to find her father. We found one likely prospect but investigation conclusively eliminated him. We found another, but he too was eliminated. I was inclined to return the retainer and withdraw, and persisted only because I am what I call tenacious and Mr. Goodwin calls pigheaded. Do you recognize the name Raymond Thorne?"

"I handle homicides, not paternity suits."
"So you do. Now, with those fingerprints, you can handle this one. You said you want to know why he killed lifer. So do I. I haven’t the slightest notion. I have told you everything I know about him. I have seen him only once, here last evening, and I asked him no questions pertaining to Elinor Denovo’s death. I asked him nothing about his attempts to see her in May. Now, of course, you will, because you need a motive, and it’s possible that you will uncover one that will have a bearing on my problem. If you do, and if you can share it with me without hazard to your case, I’ll try to erase from memory this morning’s

rageous performance. It won’t be easy - especially the sight of that creature at Mr. Goodwin’s desk, deranging his and my belongings, while you stood and applauded."
"I did not applaud. Your usual exaggeration." "You permitted."
==> "Oh, skip it. A cop gets habits like everybody else. He was looking for information, not evidence. Even if he had found Goodwin’s signed confession that he had killed Elinor Denovo it wouldn’t have been admissible evidence; ask the Supreme Court." Cramer looked at his watch and then at me. "How long has he been gone?" <==
"Maybe fifteen minutes," I told him. "When you get up don’t put your hand on the right chair arm. It has four Floyd Vance prints on it."
"Thanks for telling me." He put both palms on the right chair arm and twisted around as he got to his feet. He faced Wolfe. "I want to be there when he brings him in. I admit you sound good, but you nearly always do sound good. I’m buying nothing, at least not until I see this Floyd Vance. If it goes one way you may hear from me, and if it goes another way you will hear from me. Have I ever thanked you for anything?"
"No."
"And I’m not thanking you now. Not yet." He turned and went. I stayed put.
Wolfe opened his desk drawer to take another look, and I attacked the mess Stebbins had made. Vandalism. There was no danger that he had taken anything important because no classified items were ever left in an unlocked drawer, and after getting things in order and back where they belonged I decided that he had taken nothing, except possibly a few of my calling cards. That suggested the question, if it’s illegal for a private detective to impersonate a cop why isn’t it illegal for a cop to impersonate a private detective? I would ask Wolfe. He had shut the drawer and was leaning back, looking thoughtful but not concentrated. When I turned to him he nodded and said, "Phalaenopsis Aphrodite sanderiana."

 intended to bring them down but those intruders came. Also I brought none for my desk." He pushed his chair back.
"Instructions?"
"No. There is nothing you can do."
"Saul is standing by. So are Fred and Orrie."
==> "Release them. There is nothing. Our next step is obvious, but it must wait until Mr. Cramer learns his motive. If he learns his motive. He should, with a thousand trained men." <==
After the sound came of the elevator starting up I sat and looked it over from every angle. It was nice to know the next step was obvious, but it would have been even nicer to know what it was.

I DIDN’T KNOW THEN, and I still don’t, exactly how long it took the city employees to find out why Floyd Vance killed Elinor Denovo. I mean really wrap it up. All I know is that Cramer’s phone call didn’t come until 6:38 p.m. Thursday, just in time to make me late at the poker party again. And I still didn’t know what the obvious step was. One of the eighty-seven facts about Wolfe that I would change if I knew how is that he doesn’t believe in talking merely to satisfy anyone’s curiosity, even mine. I admit that in this case there might have been other factors - for instance, he might have wanted to see if I would dope it out for myself and make some suggestions. You probably have, but maybe you wouldn’t if you had been in my shoes, waiting for a development which depended entirely on other people, and you didn’t know what they were doing and not doing.
I did do one thing. When I learned from the noon news broadcast on Wednesday that Floyd Vance was being held without bail, and rang Lon Cohen to check it, I phoned Lily Rowan to say I wanted to see the client and was invited to lunch; and after we had finished the lobster salad and cantaloupe mousse and had gone out’ to the terrace, I told Amy that there was no more danger of her being a special target and if she went out for a walk her chances of getting back in one

iece were as good as anybody else’s. Naturally she wanted to know what had happened, and Lily did too, and I think that was the first and only time that Lily suspected me of putting on an act in connection with my work. She remembered that she had a date, some kind of a committee meeting, which I doubted, and left me there with Amy. I admit she thought she was being considerate, but it was no favor to me. I had been stalling Amy for two weeks and she wanted to know, and I couldn’t blame her. Usually you can tell a client something, but I had already told her that her mother’s name was Carlotta Vaughn, and there was absolutely nothing that I was ready to add. When I left I wasn’t at all sure that I was still the one man in the world she could trust.
Of course I read every word in the Wednesday and Thursday papers about the hit-and-run driver the police had nabbed after three months, but learned nothing about motive. I got the impression that the fingerprints which had identified him had been secured by extremely competent detective work by the Homicide Bureau, but there were no published details about it. There was no mention of Nero Wolfe or Archie Goodwin. There was a lot of new information, new to me, about Floyd Vance, and one item cleared up a point that I had wondered about. In 1944 he had been in his late twenties and single, and why hadn’t he been sent, either to Europe or to Asia, to help several million of his fellow citizens do some expert handling of the public image of the United States of America? According to Wednesday’s Gazette and News, and Thursday’s Times, he had been excused because he had some kind of a trick knee. Other items, though they cleared up nothing, told me more about him - for instance, that he had always been a tadpole in a big frog pond as a public-relations counselor. Evidently he had had very little effect on the dignity of man, either way.
When the phone rang at 6:38 p.m. Thursday, I was at my desk working on germination records and Wolfe was at his with a book he had just started on, an advance copy of The Future of Germany, by Karl Jaspers. I reached for the receiver.

==> "I want Wolfe, Goodwin. Cramer." <==
"Greetings." Without bothering to cover the transmitter, I turned my head and said, "Cramer," perhaps a little louder than usual, and Wolfe reached for his phone, perhaps a little faster than usual. I kept mine.

Yes, Mr. Cramer?"
"About Floyd Vance. You read the papers." "Yes."
"We’re going for first-degree and we expect it to stick. We’ve followed the new rules and we don’t even ask him if he’s thirsty unless his lawyer’s present. I’m willing to give you some information we haven’t released if you give me your word that you’ll keep it in confidence."

Naturally she wanted to know what had happened, and Lily did too, and I think that was the first and only time that Lily suspected me of putting on an act in connection with my work. She remembered that she had a date, some kind of a committee meeting, which I doubted, and left me there with Amy. I admit she thought she was being considerate, but it was no favor to me. I had been stalling Amy for two weeks and she wanted to know, and I couldn’t blame her. Usually you can tell a client something, but I had already told her that her mother’s name was Carlotta Vaughn, and there was absolutely nothing that I was ready to add. When I left I wasn’t at all sure that I was still the one man in the world she could trust.
Of course I read every word in the Wednesday and Thursday papers about the hit-and-run driver the police had nabbed after three months, but learned nothing about motive. I got the impression that the fingerprints which had identified him had been secured by extremely competent detective work by the Homicide Bureau, but there were no published details about it. There was no mention of Nero Wolfe or Archie Goodwin. There was a lot of new information, new to me, about Floyd Vance, and one item cleared up a point that I had wondered about. In 1944 he had been in his late twenties and single, and why hadn’t he been sent, either to Europe or to Asia, to help several million of his fellow citizens do some expert handling of the public image of the United States of America? According to Wednesday’s Gazette and News, and Thursday’s Times, he had been excused because he had some kind of a trick knee. Other items, though they cleared up nothing, told me more about him - for instance, that he had always been a tadpole in a big frog pond as a public-relations counselor. Evidently he had had very little effect on the dignity of man, either way.
When the phone rang at 6:38 p.m. Thursday, I was at my desk working on germination records and Wolfe was at his with a book he had just started on, an advance copy of The Future of Germany, by Karl Jaspers. I reached for the receiver.
"Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie - "
"I want Wolfe, Goodwin. Cramer."
==> "Greetings." Without bothering to cover the transmitter, I turned my head and said, "Cramer," perhaps a little louder than usual, and Wolfe reached for his phone, perhaps a little faster than usual. I kept mine. <==

Yes, Mr. Cramer?"
"About Floyd Vance. You read the papers." "Yes."
"We’re going for first-degree and we expect it to stick. We’ve followed the new rules and we don’t even ask him if he’s thirsty unless his lawyer’s present. I’m willing to give you some information we haven’t released if you give me your word that you’ll keep it in confidence."
"That’s rather difficult. Information that I can’t use won’t help."

"I doubt if you can use it. If you can use it without divulging it, okay." "Very well. You have my word."
"For what you want, it’s negative. For at least a year and probably longer, we’re still digging at it, Elinor Denovo was knifing him. She must have been a slick article. We can’t find that she ever once actually mentioned his name, but last spring the only two clients he had that amounted to anything left him, and we have it in writing that they switched to a firm that was suggested and recommended by Elinor Denovo. Those are the two outstanding cases, but there are several others, and by the time it gets to trial we’ll have a good file on it. As it stands now his lawyer would like to cop a plea for second-degree, but we want to wrap it up for first and I think we will. Evidently she decided, I think about a year and a half ago, to make it impossible for him to operate and she was doing a damn good job of it. You worked on him. Didn’t you get any line on it?"

"That’s why I never use it. And I doubt if you can use what I’m giving you. We’ve got a motive for Floyd Vance that’s plenty good enough and it will be even better before we’re through, but her motive for cooking him is your problem, not mine. It could be that she decided to even up for something that happened back in nineteen forty-four, but I’m glad we don’t have to dig that deep. If you want to try, you’re welcome, but Goodwin can’t get him to come

 and spend another evening in that chair. He’s not available."
"No. I was hoping for something useful, and apparently I’ll have to accept defeat. But I am obliged to you. Sincerely obliged."
"That’s a line to hang up on," Cramer said, and hung up.

Wolfe took a deep breath and a corner of his mouth went up a full quarter of an
inch. He looked at me and said, "Satisfactory."
"Satisfactory hell," I said, "it’s perfect. Simply marvelous. Do I make out a check for Miss Denovo for twenty grand?"
"Not now. That may come later." He looked at the clock. "Get Mr. Jarrett. I’ll talk."
My brows went up. "Father or son?" "Mr. Cyrus M. Jarrett."

 "No."
"I know nothing about the association of Floyd Vance and Elinor Denovo twenty-three years ago."
"Pfui. I’ll call Mr. McCray at once and advise him to make sure that certain checks in the files of the Seaboard Bank and Trust Company are not disturbed. If the police want them they can get a court order."
"Why should the police want them?"
==> "They customarily want everything that is, or may be, relevant to a murder investigation. I can ask Inspector Cramer’s opinion after I have explained their significance. Do you want me to do that?" <==
"No. If I had known the day Goodwin came ..."He decided to let the if go. "I’ll expect you here in the morning."
"I handle business only in my office. I am showing you more consideration than you deserve, sir. Will you be here tomorrow at eleven or not?"
"In the afternoon. Late afternoon."
"No. At eleven or not at all."
"At my age mornings are often difficult."

He got at a phone, the green one this time, pressed a button, and in a moment talked, and then waited. While he waited another phone buzzed, and stopped when he pushed a button. In a couple of minutes he told the green phone, "Yeah, sure." In another couple of minutes he cradled it, turned to me and said, "Apparently it’s dead. Our last word, more than a month ago, was that we might as well cross it off. They had only one man still on it. But now of course, with Nero Wolfe horning in, it’s far from dead. So it was murder. I don’t expect you to name him, even off the record, but I want enough for a page one box."
I was on my feet. "Journalists," I said, "are the salt and pepper of the earth. I would enjoy discussing that with you, but I’m on my way to a rustic swimming pool in the middle of a tailor-made glade in the Westchester woods, and I’m twenty hours late. I said it was something trivial, but have it your way. Yes, it was murder, and the driver of the car was the skunk who topped my three aces with four deuces Thursday night. I hope they get him."
I turned and went.
But down in the lobby I went to a phone booth, dialed a number I didn’t have to look up, gave my name, asked if Sergeant Stebbins was around, and after a long wait got his voice:
"Stebbins. Something up, Archie?"
==> He must have just won a bet or got a raise. He called me Archie only about once in two years, and sometimes he wouldn’t even say Goodwin but made it just you. I returned the compliment. "Nothing with a bite, Purley, just a routine question, but to answer it you may have to look at a file. You may have forgotten it, it was nearly three months ago - a hit-and-run on East Eighty-third Street, a woman named Elinor Denovo - " <==
"We haven’t forgotten it. We don’t forget a hit-and-run."
"I know you don’t, I was just being impolite for practice. Someone asked me if you’ve dug up a lead on it, and of course I didn’t know. Have you?"
"Who asked you?"

Oh, Mr. Wolfe and I were discussing crime and whether cops are as good as they ought to be, and he mentioned this Elinor Denovo. As you know, he misses nothing in the papers. I said you would probably get that one, and I was curious. Of course I’m not asking for any inside dope ..."

 said, "Good morning and greetings, but I’m busy and I’m in a rush. I really mean it."
"So am I." It was gruff, but it always is. "I’m just stopping by on my way down. Why did you call Stebbins on that hit-and-run?"
"What the hell, I told him why."
"I know you did. Also I know you and I know Wolfe. Discussing crime my ass. All right, discuss it with me now. I want to know why you’re working on that hit-and-run."
"I’m not. Mr. Wolfe isn’t." I glanced at my wrist. "I would like to ask you in for some give and take, you know I enjoy that, but I’ve got a date. Except for what was in the papers, I know absolutely nothing about that hit-and-run, and neither does Mr. Wolfe. No one has consulted with us about it. The only client we’ve got is a girl who can’t find her father and wants us to." I glanced at my wrist. "Damn it, I’ll be late." I started the door around. He opened his mouth, clamped it shut, about-faced, and started down the seven steps of the stoop. His PD car was there, double-parked. By the time he reached it I was back in the office.
==> Time was short, but it was quite possible that Cramer would phone while I was gone, and Wolfe didn’t know about my call to Purley Stebbins. He is not to be disturbed short of an emergency when he is up in the plant rooms, but he had to be told, so I took the house phone and pushed a button, and after a wait his voice came. <==
"Yes?"
"Me in a hurry. Cramer was here just now, stopping on his way downtown. I
haven’t had a chance to tell you that Saturday afternoon I rang Stebbins and - " "I’m busy!" he bellowed and hung up.
I assumed he had just found a thrip on a favorite plant or dry rot on a pseudobulb, but as I said, I do not like to be bellowed at. If Cramer called they could discuss crime. When the letters were in the envelopes and in my pocket I still had a chore left, ringing Mortimer M. Hotchkiss, the vice-president who bossed the Thirty-fourth Street branch of the Continental Bank and Trust Company. That didn’t take long; he was always glad to be of service to a

"Empty it hi the sink. It’s contaminated. Confound this smell. I’m going upstairs, but there’s a letter to write. Your notebook."
I went and sat, and for the first tune in I don’t know how long he dictated a letter standing.
"Dear Mr. Cramer: Five days ago you told Mr. Goodwin you had in your possession a leather cigar case front which you had taken nine fingerprints. Period. The cartons he will deliver to you with this letter contain an assortment of objects, comma, some of which may have on them fingerprints which may possibly match those you secured from the cigar case. Period. This is merely a conjecture, comma, and I shall be obliged if you will tell me whether it is valid. Sincerely yours. Fritz can bring it up with my breakfast for my signature. By the time you and Saul finish here I may be asleep."
He pinched his nose, told me good night, and headed for the door.
14
==> WHEN I ARRIVED AT the headquarters of Homicide South on West Twentieth Street at a quarter to nine Tuesday morning, I was on the fence. I wanted the cartons to get to Cramer as soon as possible, but if he was there I didn’t want to deliver them to him myself, because as soon as he read the letter I would be stuck. He would hold me until the prints had been lifted and compared, and if they matched I would be held tighter and longer. So I was just as well pleased that he hadn’t come yet. Neither had Purley Stebbins, but I got a sergeant I knew named Berman. When he saw the six cartons, one big enough to hold a wastebasket, which was one of the items Saul had brought from 490 Lexington Avenue, he said he hoped it wasn’t all bombs and I said no, only one was, and the trick was to guess which. He put the letter in his pocket and promised to give it to Cramer as soon as he came. <==

t would be instructive to report how Saul got a big wastebasket out of that office building at ten o’clock at night, but it would take a page.
Home again, having had only orange juice before leaving, I ate breakfast, tried to find something in the Times that deserved attention, and expected. The trouble with expecting is that you always jump the gun. It could take anywhere from one to eight hours for them to get the prints lifted and compared, but as I went to the office to dust and tear pages from desk calendars and put fresh water in the vase on Wolfe’s desk and open the mail, I was expecting the phone to ring any minute. You simply can’t help it, especially when you have no good reason to bet a dime either way on what you’re expecting. If the fingerprints didn’t match we were left with a Grade A mess and no way on earth of making a neat package of it to deliver to the client; if they did match we could take our pick of three or four different ways to play it and they all looked good. So I expected, and although I opened the mail and gave it a look before putting it under the chunk of jade on Wolfe’s desk, I had no clear idea what was in it. One thing, not in the mail, did get some real attention. Saul and I had decided that we almost certainly had enough without lifting the prints from the red leather chair. We had got bed sheets from the closet and draped them over it, and there it was, and it looked pretty silly. I removed the sheets, folded them, and put them back in the closet. What the hell, as Amy’s father would say, I was there on guard. Returning to the office, I looked at my watch for about the tenth time since breakfast, saw that it was 10:38, and decided it was time to consider it calmly and realistically. To begin with, if the prints didn’t match there was nothing to expect. Some detective second grade would phone in a day or two to tell me to come and get the junk I had left there. If they did match the best guess was that Lieutenant Rowcliff or Sergeant Stebbins would phone around two or three o’clock and tell me they wanted me there quick. Or possibly -
The doorbell rang and I went to the hall and saw Cramer and Stebbins on the stoop.
Ordinarily the sight of a pair of cops wanting in doesn’t scatter my wits, but as I started for the front I had room in my skull for only one item: the beautiful fact that the prints had matched and Floyd Vance had murdered Elinor Denovo. I should have realized that their coming twenty minutes before eleven o’clock, when they knew Wolfe wouldn’t be available, showed that it would take handling. Before I opened up I should have put the chain bolt on, holding the door to a two-inch crack, since it would have taken a warrant to open it legally and they wouldn’t have one, and we could discuss the situation. But I was so

I didn’t listen to that argument, which took ten minutes; I was concentrating on what Cramer and Stebbins would find when they went through our desks, and congratulating myself for having undraped the red leather chair. I had to stay, of course, not only because Wolfe had told me to; if I had followed them down they would have started in on me and I might overdo it, the way I felt.
They would probably be expecting us to come down together in the elevator, so when Wolfe left the stool and unbuttoned the smock I said I would take the stairs and went. Since all three flights are carpeted, noise was no problem, and they didn’t even know I was there, in the office doorway, until I spoke. Stebbins was seated at my desk, with two drawers open, and Cramer was over by the cabinets but with none of them open because they had locks.

, "I hadn’t opened the safe yet. Sorry."
Cramer about-faced and narrowed his eyes at me. Stebbins merely took more papers from a drawer and started leafing through them. A cop inside the house. The sound came of the elevator descending, and it stopped, and as Wolfe came I stepped into the office. He entered, halted, shot a glance at Cramer, glared at Stebbins, who went right on with papers, and said, "Get Mr. Parker. I’ll take it in the kitchen."
==> "What did you expect?" Cramer demanded. "Knock it off, Purley. Goodwin wants his chair. Come on, move!" <==
Stebbins tossed papers on my desk, a mess, got to his feet in no hurry, and went to get one of the yellow chairs. He likes to be with his back to a wall. By the time he had the chair where he wanted it Cramer was in the red leather chair and Wolfe, at his desk, had a drawer open to see if it was in order. He made a face and turned to Cramer. "The briefer we make this the better. You want to know who made those fingerprints."
"You’re damned right I do. And I want - "
"I know what you want, but something I want comes first. I will not have that man" - he aimed a straight finger at Stebbins - "in my house. Ransacking my office? Pfui. I would like to exclude you too, but someone even less tolerable would probably replace you. Archie. On a letterhead, Mr. Vance’s name and both addresses and telephone numbers. One carbon."
It took longer than usual to get paper and carbon in the typewriter on account of the mess Stebbins had made. As I typed Cramer said something, saw that Wolfe wasn’t listening and didn’t intend to, and shut his trap. As I rolled the paper out Wolfe said, "One to each," and I went and handed Cramer the original and Stebbins the carbon, and Wolfe told Cramer, "Get him out of here."
You have to admit that he knows when he can get away with what. In any ordinary circumstances he wouldn’t have tried telling Cramer to get Stebbins out of there, but I had just given him the name and address of a man who had left his cigar case in a hit-and-run car.

She shook her head, with her eyes staying at me. "But Mr. Goodwin. This leaves me helpless." Apparently the murder possibility hadn’t fazed her. "What can I do? I can’t tell somebody else."
That was that. I wasn’t feeling particularly cocky twenty minutes later, as I flagged a taxi headed downtown on Park Avenue and gave the hackie Saul Panzer’s address. Working for and with the best detective in the world - which you don’t have to swallow - is fine, but when you have been told by a pretty girl that you are the one man in the world she can trust, even if it was pure soap, and you have stiff-armed her, you are not on your high horse. I slouched in the taxi and tried to steer my mind back to baseball and the Mets.
It was six minutes to eight when I got out at the corner of Thirty-eighth and Park. As for what happened to my friends’ welfare, not to mention mine, I’ll skip it. Sometimes the cards simply will not cooperate.

==> FOR FRIDAY’S PROGRAM I merely had to follow the script. At a quarter to ten I let myself out of the old brownstone on West Thirty-fifth Street, went to the garage around the corner on Tenth Avenue for the Heron sedan, which Wolfe owns and I drive, and headed for Long Island, where he had been spending three days as the guest of Lewis Hewitt, who has ten thousand orchids in two 100-foot greenhouses. Driving back to Manhattan, with him in back keeping a hold on the installed-on-order strap as usual because, according to him, no automobile can be trusted for a second, I had to be careful about bumps and jerks. Not on account of Wolfe, since I had a theory that jostles were good for him, but because of the pots of orchid plants in the trunk, which were not crated, and two of them were new Laelia crosses of schroederi and ashworthiana. They were worth maybe a couple of grand, but the important point was that nobody in the world but Hewitt and now Wolfe had any. As I pulled to the curb in front of the old brownstone I blew the horn, and Theodore Horstmann came out and down, as arranged, and helped me take the pots in and up in the elevator to the plant rooms on the roof. Wolfe took his bag himself. On that I have not a theory but a rule. He needs the exercise. By the time I got down to the office he was behind his desk, in the only chair he considers satisfactory for his weight and spread, looking through the accumulated mail, and Fritz came right behind me to announce lunch. <==
At table, in the dining room across the hall, business talk was out, as always, and anyway there was no business to discuss, and I had no intention of mentioning Amy Denovo’s problem, then or ever. The talk may be of anything and everything, usually of Wolfe’s choosing, but that time I started it by remarking, as I helped myself from the silver platter, that a man had told me that shish kebab was just as good or better if it was kid instead of lamb. Wolfe said that any dish was better with kid instead of lamb, but that fresh kid, properly butchered and handled, was unattainable in the metropolitan area. Then he switched from meat to words and said it was miscalled shish kebab. It should be seekh kebab. He spelled it. That was what it was called in India, where it originated. In Hindi or Urdu a seekh is a thin iron rod with a loop at one end and a point at the other, and a kebab is a meatball. Some occidental jackass, he said, had made it shish instead of seekh, and it would serve him right if the only seekh kebab he ever got was old tough donkey instead of lamb. He was still commenting on people who garble foreign words when we finished the raspberries, stirred into a mixture, made by Fritz in a double boiler, of cream and

 sugar and egg yolks and sherry and almond extract, and went across to the office, where he got at his desk with the mail, and I got at mine with the plant records to enter the items he had talked Lewis Hewitt out of.
At four o’clock, when he took the elevator to the roof for his regular two-hour afternoon session with Theodore and the orchids, I took the stairs for the two flights to my room to do some little personal chores, like inspecting socks and changing the ribbon on my personal typewriter. Those operations always take longer than you expect, and when I heard the doorbell, which has a connection to my room, and glanced at my wrist, I was surprised to see that it was twenty to six. I left it to Fritz, who goes when I am not downstairs, but in a couple of minutes the house phone buzzed, and when I got it Fritz said that a young woman who said her name was Denovo wanted to see me, and I asked him to put her in the front room.
When, after mounting the stoop of the old brownstone, you enter, the second door down the hall on your left is the office. The first is to what we call the front room, which isn’t used much, mostly for parking people who aren’t wanted in the office. Its furniture is nothing much, not like the office or the kitchen, because Wolfe is seldom in it and doesn’t give a damn. When I entered, Amy Denovo was on a chair by a window. She stood up and said, "Well, here I am."

FOR FRIDAY’S PROGRAM I merely had to follow the script.

When, after mounting the stoop of the old brownstone, you enter, the second door down the hall on your left is the office. The first is to what we call the front room, which isn’t used much, mostly for parking people who aren’t wanted in the office. Its furniture is nothing much, not like the office or the kitchen, because Wolfe is seldom in it and doesn’t give a damn. When I entered, Amy Denovo was on a chair by a window. She stood up and said, "Well, here I am."
"So I see." I crossed to her. "It’s nice to see you and I don’t want to be rude, but I thought I made it clear yesterday."
"Oh, you made it clear enough." She started a smile but it didn’t quite come. "But I decided I had to see you again, and see Nero Wolfe, I suppose, and so I ... I did something." She had her bag, brown leather with a big clasp, under her left arm. She sat down and opened it, and took out a parcel wrapped in newspaper with rubber bands around it. She held it out and I took it, not wanting to be rude. "That’s twenty thousand dollars," she said, "in hundred-dollar bills." Now the smile came. "You would call it twenty grand. Of course you’ll want to count it."
No suitable words seemed to be ready for the tongue, so I gave them time by removing the rubber bands and unfolding the newspaper for a look. It was centuries, some new and some used, in batches fastened with paper clips, and they looked real when I flipped through some. There were ten in the batch I counted, and there were twenty batches. I rewrapped them in the newspaper and replaced the rubber bands.

"I can assume it’s in your possession legally?"
"Of course." She was still frowning. "I didn’t rob a bank."
"It’s still in your possession until he takes the job." I handed her the parcel. "It may take me five minutes or it could be half an hour. If you get tired waiting, there are magazines on the table." I started for the connecting door to the office but decided to go around, and went to the door to the hall instead.

Wolfe was at his desk with his current book, Incredible Victory, by Walter Lord. He probably hadn’t got much reading in at Hewitt’s and would have to catch up. I went to my desk, sat facing him, and waited for him to finish a paragraph. It must have been a long one. He looked up and growled. "Something?"
==> "Somebody," I said. "A girl in the front room named Amy Denovo. I believe I mentioned a while back that Miss Rowan was collecting material for a book about her father, and she hired this girl to help, and I met her there last week. As I was leaving there yesterday afternoon she - the girl - stopped me down in the lobby and we went to a place and had egg-and-anchovy sandwiches which I have told Fritz about but he wasn’t interested. She wanted me to do a job for her because I am the one man in the world she can trust, and I told her I couldn’t because I already had a job, and she said then she would hire you if I would do the work, and I explained that I always do the work. Of course the next question, my question, was about money, and I asked it. She said she had two thousand dollars in the bank, left to her by her mother, and that’s all. No other resources and no prospects. Since the job would be complicated and might take months and no telling what expenses, I told her nothing doing, I wouldn’t even mention it to you. I was sorry because - " <==
"Pfui." He grunted. "Why do you mention it now?"
"I’ll finish the sentence. I was sorry because the job would probably be interesting, and tough, and it has none of the aspects that you won’t touch. I mention it now because she is in the front room with a package wrapped in newspaper containing two hundred hundred-dollar-bills, twenty thousand dollars, which she wants you to take as a retainer."
"Where did she get it?"
"I don’t know. She says it’s in her possession legally."
He put his bookmark, a thin strip of gold that was a gift from a client, at his page and put the book down. "What was said yesterday. In full."

"No, not here. If there had been any at the office of course Mr. Thorne would have told me."
"Okay. I should mention that I no longer think it may take a year. A week may do it, or even less. Your mother made a mistake in that letter. If she didn’t want you to find out who your father was, and obviously she didn’t, she shouldn’t have mentioned that it came in bank checks. There was and is a trail, there has to be, between those checks and the sender, and she probably cashed them at a bank, since they’re centuries. Ten centuries every month. It must have been a bank, and probably her bank. We’ll find out Monday." I opened my notebook. "Now for questions, and some of them will be very personal."
That took a full hour, and I barely made it home by lunchtime. Wolfe was standing in the doorway to the dining room when I entered. By standing there he was asking me, without putting it into words, why I hadn’t phoned that I might be late, but since I was only three minutes late I ignored it and merely asked him

 if he wanted to take a glance inside the box before lunch. He said no, and I took it to the office and put it on his desk and then went and joined him at the table. As I sat I said it wouldn’t hurt his appetite to know that she had taken our suggestion and would meet me at her bank Monday morning, so if more than the retainer was needed it would be available.
==> As a rule we stay at the table for coffee at lunch, though not at dinner, but sometimes, when I have or may have something to report about a job he is committed to, he tells Fritz to bring it to the office, and my bringing the box showed that he was committed. So when we had put away the diced watermelon, which had been sprinkled with granulated sugar and refrigerated in a cup of sherry for an hour, we moved across the hall and Fritz brought coffee. I opened the box, but he merely gave it a brief glance and sat, and I went to my desk, swung my chair around, and got my notebook from a pocket. <==
"I was there nearly three hours," I said. "Do you want the crop?" "No." He was pouring coffee. "Only what may be useful."
"Then you should be back at your book in about ten minutes. To simplify it I’ll make it Elinor and Amy. The most interesting item is the fact that Elinor had no photographs anywhere, not even at the bottom of a drawer. Not one. That’s extremely significant, so please tell me what it signifies."
He made a noise, not enough of one to be called a grunt. "Did you get nothing at all?" He sipped coffee.
"Close to it. The trouble is, Amy doesn’t know anything. I doubt if there’s another girl anywhere who had a mother for twenty-two years and knows so little about her. One thing she knows, or thinks she does, is that her mother hated her and tried hard to hide it. She says that Amy means ‘beloved,’ and that Elinor probably wasn’t aware that she was being sarcastic when she named her that."
I went to the pot of coffee on Wolfe’s desk, poured a full cup, returned to my chair, and took a couple of sips. "Did Elinor have any close friends, men or women? Amy doesn’t know. Of course she has been away at college for most of the last four years. What was Elinor’s basic character? Careful, correct, and cold about covers it, according to Amy. One of the words she used was ‘introvert,’ which I would have supposed was moth-eaten for a girl just out of Smith."

"There isn’t any dope, inside or outside. It’s hanging. But we’re not forgetting it."
"Right. I hope you get him. Nobody likes a hit-and-run."
Walking to Forty-third Street for the car, I had to concede that I had got no relief at all for the itch.

YOU WOULD SUPPOSE THAT at ten minutes to ten Monday morning, as I sat in a taxicab headed uptown, with the box on the seat beside me and the breast pocket of my jacket bulging with envelopes containing letters to twelve savings banks because I never lug a brief case if I can help it, my mind would be on the morning’s program, but it wasn’t. It was on the hour just past, or part of it, instead of the one just ahead. I don’t like to have people bellow at me, particularly not Wolfe.
==> Also I had had only six hours’ sleep, a full two hours less than I need and nearly always get. Getting home after midnight Sunday, I had decided against typing twelve letters before turning in, and so had to set the alarm for seven o’clock. When it went off I opened one eye to glare at it, but I knew I would have to hustle, much as I hate hustling before breakfast, and in six minutes, maybe seven, I was on my feet. At 7:45 I was at the little table in the kitchen where I eat breakfast, on the last swallow of orange juice, and Fritz was crossing to me with the grilled ham and corn fritters, and at 8:10 I was in the office at the typewriter. At 9:15 I had finished the twelfth letter and had started folding and putting them in envelopes when the doorbell rang, and I went to the hall for a look through the one-way glass in the front door, and saw a big burly male with a big round red face topped by a big battered broad-brimmed felt hat. The hat alone would have been enough. Inspector Cramer of Homicide South must be the only man in New York who wears such a hat on a hot sunny day in August. <==
Nuts, I thought, let him ring. But it must be just for me, since he knew Wolfe was never available before eleven o’clock, so I went and opened the door and

 said, "Good morning and greetings, but I’m busy and I’m in a rush. I really mean it."
"So am I." It was gruff, but it always is. "I’m just stopping by on my way down. Why did you call Stebbins on that hit-and-run?"
"What the hell, I told him why."

"Were they here recently?"
"No, that was back in May, just after her death. But it’s true. She never spoke of her family or background - anything you could call personal, and she wasn’t a woman you would ... Well, she kept her distance. I’ll give you an example. Once a woman - an important woman, important to us; she represented one of our clients - she was saying something about her sister, and she asked Mrs. Denovo if she had a sister, and she just ignored it. Not even a yes or no. I’m pretty quick at getting on to people, and within a month after I met her, less than that, I knew she had lines I wasn’t to cross. And I never did. If you want to ask some of the others here go ahead, but you’ll be wasting your time. Do you want to try?"
Ordinarily I would have said yes, and perhaps I should have, but I was only partly there. I had come only because Wolfe had said to. Where I wanted to be was with Avery Ballou. So I said I didn’t want to interfere with their lunch hours but I might be back later, tomorrow if not today, and thanked him on behalf of Miss Denovo. He said if I come tomorrow he would have the copies of the

 photographs by four o’clock, and I thanked him again.
==> As I went down the hall to the elevator I decided to head for Al’s diner and treat myself to bacon and eggs and home-fried potatoes. Eggs are never fried in Wolfe’s and Fritz’s kitchen, and neither are potatoes, but that wasn’t the main point. The idea of sitting through lunch with Wolfe and discussing something like the future of computers or the effect of organized sport on American culture, when we should be discussing how to handle Avery Ballou, didn’t appeal to me. <==
But knowing that Wolfe had done his reflecting and was as keen to go at Ballou as I was, I reflected as I sipped coffee and decided it would do him good to be stalled off a little, say half an hour, to even up for my being stalled by his sappy rule about table talk. So I watched the time. I left the diner at two on the dot, walked the three blocks to the old brownstone, and entered the office at 2:05, got the retainer from the safe, went across the hall to the dining-room door, and said, "You said to deposit this at an early opportunity and this is it. I’ll be back in half an hour."
"No." He put his coffee cup down. "That can wait. We have a decision to make." "Sorry," I said, "I like to obey orders," and went.
I admit I didn’t loiter walking to Lexington Avenue and back, but even so I was gone thirty-six minutes. The television was on and he was standing in the middle of the room glaring at it. Presumably he had been so riled that he had picked on the one thing there that would rile him more. As I put the bankbook in the safe he turned the television off and went to his desk, and as I went to mine he demanded, "What the devil has someone done?"
Not "What have you done?"

And Sunday afternoon some uninvited people dropped in - a couple I had met there before who had a place over beyond Bedford Village. They weren’t so bad, but they had a guy with them who they said had talked them into coming because he wanted to meet me. His name was Floyd Vance and he said he was a public-relations counselor. Evidently he wanted to meet me because he wanted to meet Nero Wolfe. He was drumming up trade. He said that if anybody needed expert handling of his public image a private detective did, and he would like very much to create a presentation to propose to Nero Wolfe. He also said that if we were working on a case and I would tell him about it, he could use that as a basis for the presentation. When he said that I sharpened my eyes and ears a little, and my tongue, thinking he might be making a stab at detective work himself for somebody, for instance Cyrus M. Jarrett, but decided he was just another character who was so dedicated to improving other people’s images that he had no time left for his own. I met one once who - no, that’s enough for that weekend.
So as I said, I wasn’t feeling any better as I drove back to town. Sometimes it’s things that take the joy out of life, like a blowout when you’re hitting sixty or a button coming off of a shirt when you’re in a hurry, but usually it’s people. Of course, of the three people who had made that weekend less than perfect Amy was the only one whose contribution would carry over. Lily would do some wondering for a week or so - who wouldn’t? - but I certainly wasn’t going to explain. When two people who want to get along start needing to have things explained, look out. I would tell the client about her mother’s real name when I felt like it.

THE TROUBLE WITH PUTTING a box number on an ad instead of your name and address and phone number, especially if it’s in three papers, is getting the replies. Phoning at ten o’clock Monday morning and learning that there were some, I went for them, got two at the Times and four at the Gazette, opened them there, and found them so screwy that I bothered to take them home only because I always keep everything connected with a job until it’s finished. One was from a man who said Carlotta Vaughn was his grandmother, and maybe a Carlotta Vaughn was, but he didn’t mention Elinor Denovo.
==> When I got back a little after eleven Fritz said there had been no calls, but as I entered the office the phone rang and I crossed to my desk, nodding to Wolfe on the way, and got it. <==
"Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie Goodwin speaking."
Female voice: "Good morning. Mr. Jarrett would like to speak to Mr. Wolfe." "Good morning. Please put Mr. Jarrett on."
"Is Mr. Wolfe there?"
"Yes."
"Please put him on."

There were some items in the morning mail that needed attention, or at least got it, but we were interrupted a few times by phone calls: from Saul, who had drawn nothing but blanks; from Fred, who had found three people who had recognized the photographs but hadn’t been any help; and from Orrie, from Washington, who had verified most of Jarrett’s places and dates and was working on the rest. The hospital part, which covered most of July, was airtight. You are probably thinking that the client was getting damned little for her money, and I agree. When I returned from a trip to the mailbox at the corner it was lunchtime, and as we crossed to the dining room Wolfe said something about Mr. Cramer and I asked if he had phoned. Wolfe said no, he had come, late Saturday afternoon.
I was sorry I had missed it because talk by those two is always worth hearing. You get good examples of how much a man can say in a few words and also of how little he can say in a lot of words. So back in the office after lunch I said I would just as soon know what Cramer had wanted, and Wolfe said only what he always wanted, information; he had said nothing that would help us any.
I settled back and crossed my legs. "I haven’t kept count," I said, "but at least a thousand times I have given you a verbatim report of a conversation. I can’t tell you to because I don’t pay you, you pay me, but I can suggest it. I am suggesting it."
A corner of his mouth went up a sixteenth of an inch. For him it was a broad smile. "My memory is as good as yours, Archie."
"Then it would be no strain. I said verbatim."
==> "I know you did." He squinted at me. "Well ... Mr. Cramer, admitted by Fritz, <==

 arrived shortly after six o’clock. We ex - "
"The exact time?"
"I don’t have it on my wrist, as you do. We exchanged greetings and he sat." "Cramer: ‘Where’s Goodwin?’
"Wolfe: ‘Not here, as you see.’

"Leave that, quoting you, to my intelligence guided by experience." "You can’t give him the client’s name."
"Certainly not. But he probably knows it, after that ad."
"Very well. First, Mr. Thorne."
==> It took nearly an hour to get Raymond Thorne because he was somewhere watching TV cameras make a Raymond Thorne production, and when I finally had him he said he couldn’t possibly make it at six o’clock. I reminded him that he had told me he would like to help Amy any way he could, and he said he would come at nine. Getting Inspector Cramer was easier and quicker. He was at his office and would see me. Wolfe had gone up to the plant rooms and I went to the kitchen to tell Fritz I was leaving. <==
The cop at the top of Homicide South could surely have had a bigger room and a bigger desk and better chairs for visitors than the setup on West Twentieth Street, but Cramer liked to stick to things he was used to, including that old felt hat, which was always there on a corner of his desk when it wasn’t on his head, although there was a rack only a step away. I sat on the wooden chair at the end of his desk while he finished with a folder he was going through. When he closed it and turned to me, I said, "I bring hot news. We’re working on that hit- and-run. Mr. Wolfe thought we should tell you because we said we weren’t."
He put on an act. He demanded, "What hit-and-run?"
"On May twenty-sixth, nineteen sixty-seven, a woman named Elinor Denovo was crossing Eighty-second Street and - "
"Oh, yes. So you’re working on it. So Wolfe wants to know something, so he sends you. He can go to hell."
I nodded. "So you would like to know what he wants to know, so you let me in when you’re busy. I’ll make it brief and answer questions within reason. What we told you was the truth and the whole truth: our only client was and is a woman who wants us to find her father, whom she has never seen. She doesn’t know who or what he was or is, and she wants to. We have smoked out three different Grade A leads, but they have all fizzled. Two full weeks, and we have a load of nothing, either for the client or for you. So an hour ago Mr. Wolfe

I got the Manhattan book and found the page. "Four-ninety Lexington Avenue. Not the best. It should be Madison."
"Tell them to trace him back and cover nineteen forty-four thoroughly, but not to risk prompting him. That will be no problem with Saul and Fred, but with Orrie make it emphatic as usual."
"Right." I had emptied the snifter during the lip act, and as he pushed his chair back I went to pour another swallow. It might put me to sleep a few seconds quicker.

NOT A FLY. Flies don’t buzz. Mosquito. No. Too loud. What the ... Oh. House phone, for God’s sake. I opened an eye, stretched an arm and got it, said, "Well?"
==> Fritz’s voice said, "Good morning, Archie. He wants you." <==
I glared at the clock on the bedstand, realized that it actually said twenty-five minutes past eight, and swung my feet around. Figuring out whether I had failed to turn the alarm on, or it had tried to stir me and it had failed, would have to wait. I called for will power, gave it time to deliver, made it to my feet, concentrated on locating the door, and stepped.
The door of Wolfe’s room, which is above the kitchen, at the rear of the house where he gets the sun in winter, stood open. When I entered, with my bare feet making no sound, he was seated at the table, with the Times propped on the rack, dropping a bit of toast into the sauce of eggs au beurre noir. When I cleared my throat he got the toast to and into his mouth before he turned his head.
"The time is out of joint," I said.
He frowned. "I don’t talk in quotations, even Shakespeare, and neither do you."

Miss Rowan does sometimes and she likes that one. As you see, I am no longer on daylight saving. Apparently you are." He was fully dressed: a nice clean yellow shirt with narrow maroon stripes, a maroon tie, and a brown summerweight self-striped suit. Up in the plant rooms he would shed the jacket and put on a smock.
He swallowed a bite of egg and said, "It’s nearly nine o’clock."
"By daylight saving, yes, sir. I’ll brief them while I’m eating breakfast."
"Only Saul. We won’t risk it with Fred and Orrie. Tell them to be on call. You and Saul will decide on your approach and you may need them later. First, is he involved? If yes, merely as the murderer, with a motive that doesn’t concern us, or also as the father? We can’t waste our time and the client’s money just on finding a culprit for Mr. Cramer." He dropped toast in the sauce.
"I’m waking up," I said. "Or I got ideas in my sleep. Last night I said we don’t have to answer the question how he knew we were on it, but if he’s the father it may be important. If he’s the father there’s some connection between him and Cyrus Jarrett, or why did Jarrett send the checks? And if Jarrett told him that Nero Wolfe is out to find the father, and if he is also the murderer, what about Miss Denovo? We might lose a client. I doubt if you want another casualty like Simon Jacobs on the record, and I certainly don’t. I suggest that we’d better get her out of circulation."
==> He made a face. "Fritz." <==
That was what he calls flummery. It was true that when, for security reasons, it had been necessary to have a female guest sleeping and eating in the South Room, which is above Wolfe’s, Fritz hadn’t been able to hide how he felt about it, but Wolfe hadn’t even tried to hide how he felt.
"I’m aware," I said, "that if we did it again Fritz might leave and you might too. I don’t mean here. She spends most of her days at Miss Rowan’s, and she could spend her nights there too until we get him or drop him. Miss Rowan has two spare rooms. I’ll suggest it. Anything else?"
He said no and I went back up a flight to do in ten minutes what usually takes me thirty. By the time I got down to the kitchen, having stopped in the office to tell Fred and Orrie that Saul and I were going to pick up a trail and might need them later, my fog was starting to clear.

A detective is supposed to get onto things and people, but I gave up long ago trying to get onto Fritz all the way, so I didn’t bother to try to guess how he had known Fred and Orrie would be leaving and Saul would be staying. He knows Saul loves his eggs au beurre noir, and there were two chairs and two places ready at my breakfast table. Saul went to the range to watch him baste, and said he had tried it a hundred times but it never tasted the same. As we ate I told Saul about Floyd Vance and the various angles, and we took our second cups of coffee to the office to consider ways and means. Wolfe had said that the first question was, Is he involved? but Saul agreed with me that it couldn’t do any harm to regard that as answered and proceed accordingly. He also agreed that it would help if he had a look at him, and I got at the phone and dialed the number of Nathaniel Parker, the lawyer.

"Yes, Archie?" I like the way Parker says yes, Archie. He knows that handling something for Wolfe can be interesting but that it may be tough and ticklish, so the yes, Archie is half glad and half sad.

I told him it was nothing much this time. "Just a little chore. A man named Floyd Vance has an office at Four-ninety Lexington Avenue. He’s a counselor, but not at law, at public relations, which as you know is a much newer profession. The chore is to ring him and tell him you have a client who is thinking of engaging his services, and you would like to send a man to discuss it with him. The name of the man is Saul Panzer, whose qualifications you know about. He can go any time, the sooner the better. I’m going out, but Saul will be here to take your call. You have the name? Floyd Vance."
"I have it. What if he wants particulars?" "You’re not prepared to give him any."
"That’s a good way to put it. I am certainly not prepared. Give the genius my regards."
He meant it, but he knew I knew exactly what he would put in a long footnote. I dialed another familiar number to make another request and then went up to my room for a quick shave and change. The ten minutes before breakfast hadn’t been enough.

Jesus. Give me a pad and pencil. I’ll have to make notes."
We hadn’t wiped a pad. You can’t think of everything. I got one from a drawer, and a pencil, and went with them, and he took them, probably because he was uncertain what to do with his tongue and so was glad to have something to do with his hands.
"As you see," Wolfe said, "I have - since you fancy clichés - an embarrassment of riches." His head tilted; I hadn’t sat. "Beer, please, Archie?"
"Yes, sir." I took a step and stopped. "Something wet, Mr. Vance?"
He shook his head and said emphatically, "No." I started out, foiled because a glass or bottle is a "best bet, and as I neared the door his voice stopped me. "What the hell. Scotch and water. And ice."
==> Fritz, having been told that he wouldn’t be needed, had gone out. In the kitchen I put Wolfe’s beer and glass on a tray, and on another tray a wiped glass, a bowl which I wiped before putting ice cubes in it, a pitcher which I wiped before putting water in it, and a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black which I also wiped. That took a while and made me miss something. When I got to the office with the trays Vance had used his hands some more and had a cigar lit, so I didn’t know if he carried them loose or in a case, or if he had used the matches on the stand. The cigar was a long panatela, nothing like a Gold Label Bonita, but that didn’t bother me; if he had left that case in the hit-and-run car it would have been common prudence to switch. After serving the trays I went back to the kitchen for a glass of milk and when I returned to the office Vance had his glass in his hand and Wolfe was talking. <==
"... for I have no intention or desire to make any demand or indictment, and I don’t think my client has either. I want only what I have been hired to get, information. I can’t name my client, but if my questions reveal her identity to you, that in itself would answer my basic question. The advertisement plainly implied that the woman once known as Carlotta Vaughn was later known as Elinor Denovo, but if you prefer to tell me nothing about Elinor Denovo we’ll restrict it to Carlotta Vaughn. By the way..."
He opened a drawer and took out the two photographs. I had cautioned him not to handle them in a way that would make it obvious that he was taking care not to leave prints - the Police Department files already had samples of his - and he did all right, perfectly normal as he handed them to me and I passed them on to

 Vance.
"She was Elinor Denovo when those were taken," Wolfe said, "but had been Carlotta Vaughn only a year or two previously, so you should recognize her."

He growled. "How long will that cigar smoke last?"
"The air conditioner will do it in about an hour." I was gently wrapping in tissue paper the glass that had held Scotch. "I need your help on a decision. The bottle is more than half full of Johnnie Walker Black. About six dollars’ worth. Do we donate it to Cramer or do I empty it?"
"Empty it hi the sink. It’s contaminated. Confound this smell. I’m going upstairs, but there’s a letter to write. Your notebook."
I went and sat, and for the first tune in I don’t know how long he dictated a letter standing.
==> "Dear Mr. Cramer: Five days ago you told Mr. Goodwin you had in your possession a leather cigar case front which you had taken nine fingerprints. Period. The cartons he will deliver to you with this letter contain an assortment of objects, comma, some of which may have on them fingerprints which may possibly match those you secured from the cigar case. Period. This is merely a conjecture, comma, and I shall be obliged if you will tell me whether it is valid. Sincerely yours. Fritz can bring it up with my breakfast for my signature. By the time you and Saul finish here I may be asleep." <==
He pinched his nose, told me good night, and headed for the door.
14
WHEN I ARRIVED AT the headquarters of Homicide South on West Twentieth Street at a quarter to nine Tuesday morning, I was on the fence. I wanted the cartons to get to Cramer as soon as possible, but if he was there I didn’t want to deliver them to him myself, because as soon as he read the letter I would be stuck. He would hold me until the prints had been lifted and compared, and if they matched I would be held tighter and longer. So I was just as well pleased that he hadn’t come yet. Neither had Purley Stebbins, but I got a sergeant I knew named Berman. When he saw the six cartons, one big enough to hold a wastebasket, which was one of the items Saul had brought from 490 Lexington Avenue, he said he hoped it wasn’t all bombs and I said no, only one was, and the trick was to guess which. He put the letter in his pocket and promised to give it to Cramer as soon as he came.

t would be instructive to report how Saul got a big wastebasket out of that office building at ten o’clock at night, but it would take a page.

Home again, having had only orange juice before leaving, I ate breakfast, tried to find something in the Times that deserved attention, and expected. The trouble with expecting is that you always jump the gun. It could take anywhere from one to eight hours for them to get the prints lifted and compared, but as I went to the office to dust and tear pages from desk calendars and put fresh water in the vase on Wolfe’s desk and open the mail, I was expecting the phone to ring any minute. You simply can’t help it, especially when you have no good reason to bet a dime either way on what you’re expecting. If the fingerprints didn’t match we were left with a Grade A mess and no way on earth of making a neat package of it to deliver to the client; if they did match we could take our pick of three or four different ways to play it and they all looked good. So I expected, and although I opened the mail and gave it a look before putting it under the chunk of jade on Wolfe’s desk, I had no clear idea what was in it. One thing, not in the mail, did get some real attention. Saul and I had decided that we almost certainly had enough without lifting the prints from the red leather chair. We had got bed sheets from the closet and draped them over it, and there it was, and it looked pretty silly. I removed the sheets, folded them, and put them back in the closet. What the hell, as Amy’s father would say, I was there on guard. Returning to the office, I looked at my watch for about the tenth time since breakfast, saw that it was 10:38, and decided it was time to consider it calmly and realistically. To begin with, if the prints didn’t match there was nothing to expect. Some detective second grade would phone in a day or two to tell me to come and get the junk I had left there. If they did match the best guess was that Lieutenant Rowcliff or Sergeant Stebbins would phone around two or three o’clock and tell me they wanted me there quick. Or possibly -
The doorbell rang and I went to the hall and saw Cramer and Stebbins on the stoop.
Ordinarily the sight of a pair of cops wanting in doesn’t scatter my wits, but as I started for the front I had room in my skull for only one item: the beautiful fact that the prints had matched and Floyd Vance had murdered Elinor Denovo. I should have realized that their coming twenty minutes before eleven o’clock, when they knew Wolfe wouldn’t be available, showed that it would take handling. Before I opened up I should have put the chain bolt on, holding the door to a two-inch crack, since it would have taken a warrant to open it legally and they wouldn’t have one, and we could discuss the situation. But I was so

 glad to see them that I swung the door wide, and I was probably showing my teeth in a big grin of welcome. If so, it soon went. They came in fast, Stebbins’ shoulder jostling me as he passed, headed for the rear, and started up the stairs.
==> A cop inside the house is a very different problem from one outside. Once he’s inside legally, and I had opened the door, about all you can do is sit down and write a letter to the Supreme Court. Even if I could beat them to the plant rooms, and I couldn’t, since the elevator was up there, what good would it do? I went to the kitchen to tell Fritz what had happened and that I was going up to join the party, and then took my time mounting the three flights. <==
To go through those three rooms, the cool, the moderate, and the warm, down the aisles between the benches, without being stopped by a color or a shape that you didn’t know existed, your mind must be fully occupied with something else. That time mine was. In the middle room I could already hear a voice, and when I opened the door to the warm room I could name it. Cramer. I walked the aisle and opened the door to the potting room, and there they were. Wolfe, in a yellow smock, was on his stool at the big bench. Theodore was standing over by the pot racks. Stebbins was off to the right. Cramer, in the center of the room, had his felt hat off and in his hand, I don’t know why. Facing Wolfe, he was telling him, louder than necessary, "...and hold you as material witnesses until we get warrants and then, by God, you go to a cell. All right, talk or move."
Wolfe stayed on the stool. His eyes came to me. "Any complaint, Archie?" "Only their bad manners. Next time they’ll talk through a crack."
His eyes moved. "Mr. Cramer. As I said, I will not talk business in this room. Not a word. If you’ll wait in my office I’ll be down at eleven o’clock. If you put hands on me, and Mr. Goodwin, and take us elsewhere, we’ll stand mute and communicate with our lawyer. When he comes we’ll confer with him privately, and the afternoon paper, the Gazette, and tomorrow morning’s papers, will publish the news that Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin have discovered the identity of the murderer of Elinor Denovo and have delivered satisfactory evidence to the police. Also, that in recognition of that public service they have been arrested and are behind bars, and their lawyer is arranging to secure their release on bail. Archie, here, please. This Miltonia charlesworthi germination card has conflicting entries. We’ll have to check it."
I went and took the card and scowled at it.

nd ever since Jarrett had hung up, for something that had happened Thursday evening, when I had let Lon Cohen rake in a fat pot without showing, though it was at least three to two that my tens would have taken it. But now, as eleven o’clock came closer and closer, that danger got slimmer and slimmer, and it looked surer and surer that Jarrett’s tie-in was so very personal that he couldn’t risk it.
Wolfe came down at eleven on the dot, put the daily display in the vase on his desk, sat, and went at the morning mail. I had the expense book at my desk, checking entries and additions and getting totals, on the theory that they were final totals, except for Saul today. Just a pair of private detectives starting the daily grind, yeah. The reason they weren’t holding their breath was that a man can’t hold his breath more than about two minutes, and the doorbell didn’t ring until a quarter past eleven.
The first two things I noticed when I opened the front door were that the car Jarrett had come in was a Heron town car, and that his eyes were exactly the same as they had been two weeks ago. I felt that I deserved a credit mark for the way I said, "Good morning." I could have made it a jab or even a jeer, but I swear it was just a cordial welcome.
He also said, "Good morning," but it wasn’t a cordial anything. It was probably merely the way he had always said good morning, and always would, to everybody from the office boy to the senior vice-president. What was different from before was his walk as he went down the hall to the office. He didn’t totter, but his steps were short and he made sure of each one before he took the next one. I waited until he had got safely lowered into the red leather chair to say, "Mr. Jarrett. Mr. Wolfe."
Jarrett said, "A footstool and a glass of water."
==> The only footstools in the house were in Fritz’s room in the basement. On my way to the kitchen to ask to borrow it and tell him a glass of water was wanted, a glance showed me Saul and Amy in the alcove, and her shoes were off In Fritz’s big cluttered den in the basement, with its 294 cookbooks on eleven shelves, there were three footstools, and I took the biggest one, which was topped with a tapestry with a woven hunter aiming a spear at a woven wild boar. <==
Back up and in the office, I found that I hadn’t missed any conversation. Jarrett

was taking a large blue pill from a little gold box, and I stood with the footstool until he had put the pill in his mouth and got it down with a swallow of water. He may have expected me to lift his feet to get the stool under, presumably Oscar would have, but I wasn’t that cordial. After he got the glass back on the stand he lifted them himself and I slid the stool under.
"There’s a competent doctor a few doors away," Wolfe said.
"No," Jarrett said. The eyes were as frozen as ever and the bony jaw as set. "I told you mornings are difficult. Talk."

"Damn your impudence." The bony jaw twitched. "I’m old. I’m not sick. You will not hector me, sick or well. Talk."
Wolfe’s shoulders went up a little and down. "Very well, sir, I’ll talk, but it will go faster if you accept the realities of the situation. You say I won’t hector you, but I already have. I bullied you into coming this morning, and in doing so I completely exposed my position. I made it clear that you are faced with an alternative: either you will answer my questions about certain matters, answers that will satisfy me, or I will give the police information that will move them to investigate thoroughly your relations over the years with two people - Floyd Vance and Carlotta Vaughn, later Elinor Denovo. If you are not conversant with criminal law you may not know why the police will be concerned. Floyd Vance’s lawyer, if he knows he can’t get his client acquitted, and he can’t, because of evidence supplied by Mr. Goodwin and me, will try to get a verdict of accidental homicide or second-degree murder. The police and the District Attorney will want a verdict of first-degree murder, and to get it they will need to establish a motive. You could verify this by communicating with the police or the District Attorney, but of course you can’t do that, since you don’t want the details of your connection with those two people to be disclosed. And they would inevitably be disclosed; once the police get the concrete evidence of the connection, the checks you sent to Elinor Denovo during those twenty-three years, they will uncover all the facts. That’s a task for which they are admirably equipped."
Wolfe turned a hand over and said, with no change of tone, "You had an early breakfast and a long ride. Will you have refreshment of any kind? Coffee or other drink? A sandwich, pastry, fruit? Thyme honey on corn fritters?"


==> Jarrett’s jaw worked. "Damn your impudence." He ignored the offer of refreshments, which was a pity, for he had never tasted Fritz’s corn fritters coated with wild thyme honey. "This is blackmail," he said, "but even if I would pay, you couldn’t deliver. If you don’t tell the police about those checks McCray will, or one of the others." <==
"No. Not possibly. They have no knowledge, not even a suspicion, of any connection between you and Floyd Vance. Only Mr. Goodwin and I have that."
"You do not. There is no connection. If you - "
"Mr. Jarrett. Don’t talk nonsense. Accept the realities. The mere mention of Floyd Vance’s name brought you to the telephone, and what I added brought you here. Pfui. Confound it, you’re not well"
It was something to see, how, in that fix, Jarrett’s eyes stayed as hard and cold as when he had told me I was an idiot. "You’re lying about McCray," he said. "He’s behind this and behind you."
"No. Only fools tell lies that are vulnerable. My sole concern is the interest of my client, Miss Amy Denovo, the daughter of Elinor Denovo."

==> IT HAPPENS ONCE or twice a week. Lily Rowan and I, returning from a show or party or hockey game, leave the elevator and approach the door of her penthouse on top of the apartment building on Sixty-third Street between Madison and Park, and there is the key question. Mine is, Do I stay back and let her do it? Hers is, Does she stay back and let me do it? We have never discussed it, and it is always handled the same way. When she gets out her key as we leave the elevator she gives me a smile which means, "Yes, you have one, but it’s my door," and I smile back and follow her to it. It is understood that mine is for situations that seldom arise. <==
That Thursday afternoon in August we had been to Shea Stadium to watch the Mets clobber the Giants, which they had done, 8 to 3, and it was only twenty past five when she used her key. Inside, she called out to Mimi, the maid, that she was home, and went to the bathroom, and I went to the bar in a corner of the oversized living room, with its 19-by-34 Kashan rug, for gin and ice and tonic and glasses. By the time I got out to the terrace with the tray she was there, at a table under the awning, studying the scorecard I had kept.
"Yes, sir," she said as I put the tray down, "Harrelson got three hits and batted in two runs. If he was here I’d hug him. Good."
"Then I’m glad he’s not here." I gave her her drink and sat. "If you hugged that kid good you’d crack a rib."
A voice came. "I’m going, Miss Rowan."
Our heads turned. The young woman in the doorway to the living room was a

"Then I’m glad he’s not here." I gave her her drink and sat. "If you hugged that kid good you’d crack a rib."
A voice came. "I’m going, Miss Rowan."
Our heads turned. The young woman in the doorway to the living room was a

==>  newcomer to the penthouse. I had seen her only twice, and she was easy to look at, with just enough round places, just round enough, properly spotted on her five-foot-four getup, and her warm dark skin just right for her quick brown eyes. Her dark-brown hair was bunched at the back. Her name was Amy Denovo and she had got a diploma from Smith in June. Lily had hired her ten days ago, at a hundred a week, to help her find and arrange material for a book a man was going to write about Lily’s father, who had made a pile building sewers and other items and had left her enough boodle to keep a dozen penthouses. <==
She answered a couple of questions Lily asked, and left, and we talked baseball, concentrating on what the Mets had, if anything, besides Tommy Davis and Bud Harrelson and Tom Seaver, and what they might have if we lived long enough. We dawdled with the drinks, and at six o’clock I got up to go, leaving Lily plenty of time to change for a dinner she had been hooked for, where people were going to abolish ghettos by making speeches. I had a date, later, where I intended to abolish the welfare of some friends of mine by drawing another ace or maybe jack.
But down in the lobby I was intercepted. Albert, the doorman, was moving to open the door for me when a voice spoke my name and I turned, and Amy Denovo left a chair and was coming. She gave me a nice little smile and said, "Could you give me a few minutes to ask you something?"
I said, "Sure, shoot," and she glanced at Albert, and he took the hint and went outside. I said we might as well sit and we went to a bench at the wall, but the door opened again and a man and woman entered, crossed to the elevator, and stood.
Amy Denovo said, "It is rather public, isn’t it? I said a few minutes, but I suppose ... it might be more than just a few. If you could? And I ... it’s very personal ... I mean personal to me."
I hadn’t noticed the dimples before. They are always more taking on a dark skin than on a light skin. "You’re twenty-two," I said.

Oh, it isn’t that! It’s very personal."
"Don’t think marriage isn’t personal. It’s too damn personal, that’s the trouble. If you mean a few hours, not a few minutes, I’m sorry; I have an eight o’clock date, but there’s a place around the corner that sells drinks and makes good egg- and-anchovy sandwiches. If you like anchovies."
"I do."
The door opened and two women entered and headed for the elevator. That was
not the place to discuss very personal matters.
==> She was all right to walk with, no leading or lagging and no silly step-stretching. At that time of day in August there was plenty of room in the back at The Cooler, and we got the corner table where Lily and I had often had a snack. When the waitress had taken our order and left, I asked if she wanted to put off being personal until we had something inside. <==
She shook her head. "I might as well ..." She let it hang ten seconds and then blurted, "I want you to find my father."
I raised a brow. "Have you lost him?"
"No. I haven’t lost him ... because I never had him." She said it fast, as if someone was trying to stop her. "I decided I had to tell somebody - that was a month ago - and then I got this job with Miss Rowan and I found out that she knows you, and I met you, and of course I know about you and Nero Wolfe. But I don’t want Nero Wolfe to do it, I want you to."
There were no dimples, and the quick brown eyes were fastened on me.
"That won’t work," I told her. "I’m on full time with Mr. Wolfe, twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week when they’re needed, and I don’t take jobs on my own. But I have a loose hour" - I looked at my watch - "and twenty minutes, and if you want a suggestion I might possibly have one. No charge."

"He would do his share, directed by me except when urgency forbids. The

 money is in that parcel? May I see it?"
She got up and handed it to him and returned to the chair. He removed the rubber bands and wrapping and took a look at each batch, all twenty of them, stacking them neatly on his desk. He turned to me. "I see no indication of source. Did you?"
I said no.
==> He turned to her. "Did Miss Lily Rowan supply it?" <==
"Of course not!"
"But of course someone did. In view of what you told Mr. Goodwin yesterday, I would have to know the source of this money. Where and how did you get it?"
Her lips were tight. She opened them to say, "I don’t see why you have to know that. There’s nothing wrong with the way I got it. It’s mine. If I went to a store to buy something and gave them one of those bills they wouldn’t ask me where I got it."
He shook his head. "Not a parallel, Miss Denovo. Yesterday you told Mr. Goodwin that two thousand dollars in the bank was all you had, and you rejected his suggestion that you ask Miss Rowan to help you." He tapped the stack. "This is ten times two thousand. If it was a loan or a gift I would have to know from whom. If you sold something I would have to know what you sold and to whom. You may not know, at your age, that that is merely reasonable prudence. To accept a substantial retainer for a difficult and complicated operation without assurance of its legitimacy would be asinine, and if you won’t tell me where you got this money I won’t take it. If you do tell me it will have to be verified, with proper discretion, but to my satisfaction."
She was frowning again, not at him, at me, but it wasn’t really for me; it was for the problem she had been handed. But when she spoke it was to me and for me, a question: "Is he right, Mr. Goodwin? Or is he just shutting the door, as you did?"

"Yes. I don’t go to Miss Rowan on Saturday."
"Then expect him around ten o’clock. He will want to see the box and its contents, and the letter, and he will want all the information you can give him. What you told him yesterday is a mere prologue." He turned. "Archie. Give her a receipt for this money. Not as a retainer; that can wait until you have seen the box and the letter, and you will verify the handwriting of the letter. Just a receipt for the amount, her property, entrusted to me for safekeeping."
I turned my chair, pulled the typewriter around, and opened a drawer for paper and carbon.

I WAS INTERESTED, naturally, in Elinor Denovo’s apartment. We were probably going to need to know everything about her that was knowable, and a woman’s home can have a hundred hints, two or three of which you may get if you have any savvy at all and are lucky. So before settling down with Amy and my notebook in the living room I took a tour, with Amy along. There were a small foyer, a medium-sized living room, two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a small kitchen. If the foyer or kitchen or bathroom had any hints they weren’t for me; for instance, there was nothing in the bathroom to indicate that it had ever been used by a man, but of course Elinor hadn’t been there for nearly three months.
==> I gave Amy’s bedroom just a glance; for her I had a better source of hints, herself. She said she hadn’t changed anything in her mother’s bedroom. It might have told a woman, especially a Lily Rowan, a lot, but all I got was that she had liked pale green for drapes and the bed cover, she used three different scents, all expensive, and she didn’t mind if the rug had a big spot near the bathroom door. The living room did have a few hints which might help or might not. There were five pictures on the walls, and they were all color reproductions of paintings by Georgia O’Keeffe - data supplied by Amy. I would have to check on O’Keeffe. The only piece of furniture that was upholstered was the couch, and there were only two cushions on it. I have seen couches with a dozen. The four chairs didn’t match one another, and none of them matched the couch. The books, seven <==

 whole shelves of them, were such a mixture, all kinds, fiction and nonfiction, that after I had looked at twenty or thirty titles I quit.
The one really good hint, if someone would tell me what it meant, was that there were no photographs. Except for those in Amy’s room, which belonged to her, there wasn’t a single photograph in the place, not one, of anyone or anything. That was hard to believe, but Amy said that as far as she knew there had never been any, and she had none of her mother, not even a snapshot, which was a setback, since we would certainly want to know what Elinor Denovo had looked like. I would probably have had to look long and far to find another middle-aged woman who had died, or would die, absolutely photographless.
There were papers, letters, and paid bills and miscellaneous items, including the stuff from her room at the office, but there was no diary or anything resembling one, and there was nothing that seemed likely to be of any help. If it got too tough I might have to have another go at it or put Saul Panzer on it. I did use a few of the items, in Elinor’s handwriting, to check the writing on the letter that was in the box with the money. It geed.
When I finally sat on the couch with my notebook, with Amy on one side and the box on the other, it was getting on toward noon. Amy looked two years younger; she hadn’t bunched her hair and it was dancing around when she moved her head. I got a piece of folded paper from my breast pocket.

"I agree. Oh, you asked me last evening if Amy is interested not so much in genes but in gold. Does she think that a father who could be so free with bank checks must have a barrel of it and she would like to dip in? I passed, and I still do. After spending three hours with her I doubt it, and anyway, does it matter? To us?"
"No." He put his cup down and pushed it back. "Monday should be more

 fruitful. You’re off, I suppose."
I nodded. "I was expected last evening, as you know." I rose. "Shall I put that in the safe?"
==> He said no, he would, and I gave him the key to the box, put the notebook in a drawer, whirled my chair and pushed it against my desk as always, and went - out and up to my room to change and pack a bag. I had phoned Lily that I would make it in time for dinner. <==
It was a quarter to three when I left the house, walked around the corner to the garage, got the Heron, and headed up Tenth Avenue. At Thirty-sixth Street I turned right. The direct route would have been left on Forty-fifth Street for the West Side Highway, but I don’t like to have something itching me when I’m stretched out at the edge of Lily’s swimming pool and flowers are smelling and birds are flying and so on. On East Forty-third Street parking was no problem on Saturday afternoon.
Entering the Gazette building, I took the elevator to the twentieth floor. For the file I could have gone to the morgue instead, but Lon Cohen might know of some recent development that the Gazette hadn’t had room for. When I entered his room, two doors down from the publisher’s corner room, he was talking to one of the three phones on his desk and I sat on the one other chair, at the end of the desk, and waited. When he hung up he swung around and said, "After what happened Thursday night how did you get here? Walk? You sure didn’t have taxi fare."
I answered suitably, and when personal comments were, in my opinion, even, I said I knew I shouldn’t bother an assistant to a publisher about something trivial; I only wanted to get the details of a hit-and-run that had killed a woman named Elinor Denovo, the last week in May, and would he ring the morgue and tell them to oblige me. He got at a phone and did what he knew I expected him to, told someone to bring the file up to him. When a boy came with it, in about six minutes, no more, he was at another phone and I had moved my chair about a foot back to be discreet. The boy put the file on his desk and I reached and got it.
There were only seven items: four clippings and three typed reports. It hadn’t made the front page, but was on page 3 for Saturday, May 27, and the first thing I noticed was that there was no picture of her, so even the Gazette hadn’t dug

e up. I went through everything. Mrs. Elinor Denovo (so she was Mrs. to the world) had returned her car to the garage where she kept it, on Second Avenue near Eighty-third Street, Friday night after midnight, and told the attendant she would want it around noon the next day. Three minutes later, as she was crossing Eighty-third Street in the middle of the block, presumably bound for her apartment on Eighty-second Street, a car had hit her, tossed her straight ahead, and run over her with two wheels. Only four people had seen it happen: a man on the sidewalk walking east, a hundred feet or more away, a man and woman on the sidewalk going west, the same direction as the car, about the same distance away, and a taxi driver who had just turned his cab into Eighty-third Street from Second Avenue. They all said that the car that hit her hadn’t even slowed down, but were unanimous on nothing else. The hackie thought the driver, alone in the car, was a woman. The man coming east said it was a man, alone. The man and woman thought it was two men, both in the front seat. The hackie thought the car was a Dodge Coronet but wasn’t sure; the man coming east said it was a Chevy; the man and woman didn’t know. Two of them said the car was dark green, one said it was dark blue, and one said it was black. So much for eyewitnesses. Actually, it was a dark-gray Ford. It was hot. Mrs. David A. Ernst of Scarsdale, who owned it, had gone for it at ten o’clock Friday evening where she had parked it on West Eleventh Street, and it wasn’t there. A cop had spotted it Saturday afternoon parked on East 123rd Street, and by Monday the scientists had cinched it that it was the one that had got Elinor Denovo.

y not offer him nine in the evening too?"
"As you know, I don’t like to work after dinner. But I suppose... Very well. Add it."
I pulled the typewriter around and got out paper and carbon.
An hour later, as I headed north on the Henry Hudson Parkway, keeping to sixty, I wasn’t on a perch either professionally or personally. Professionally, the client was being neglected. I had phoned her Friday morning that it was very unlikely that Jarrett was her father, and told her why, and that was all. She deserved to know that she had been right about Denovo, that her mother’s real name was Carlotta Vaughn; at least we could give her that for the eight days we had been on it. Personally, there I was bound for a swimming pool in a glade while Orrie was in Washington digging into army records and Saul and Fred were poking into holes that were probably empty. I should have been doing something brilliant, like finding a mattress somewhere with hairs from two human heads on it which a scientist would prove had been left there by Carlotta Vaughn, alias Elinor Denovo, and Eugene Jarrett.
==> I wasn’t feeling any better as I drove back to town Sunday evening. The weekend had been messy. There is never more than one house guest besides me; it may be anybody from a female poet to a cowboy from the Montana ranch Lily owns; and that time it was Amy Denovo. She gave it a good start only an hour after I arrived. She called me Archie. We were on the terrace. I had finished off the steak Mimi had broiled - they had eaten - and was forking the blueberry pie when Amy got out a cigarette and I lit it, and she said, "Thank you, Archie." Of course Lily didn’t bat an eye; she wouldn’t. But as far as she knew Amy had seen me only three times for a total of about nine minutes, and she didn’t have to be a cluster of vagaries to wonder what the score was. Was Amy just being flip, or had I decided to see more of her, not at the penthouse, and taken steps? I couldn’t tell her what Miss Denovo had hired Wolfe to do, so I skipped it. But it was there in the air. Between Lily and me it was thoroughly understood that what I did was none of her business unless it touched her - and, naturally, vice versa - but the fact that I had met Miss Denovo at the penthouse put it on the borderline. So it didn’t help the weekend. <==
A couple of other things didn’t help either. One of the five guests for lunch Saturday was a woman with a green wig who had positive inside information

 that President Johnson and Dean Rusk had decided three years ago to kill everybody in China with hydrogen bombs, and that was the real reason for what they were doing in Vietnam.
Of course the only thing to do with such a clunk is to ignore him or her, but she kept it up so loud and long that I finally told her that I had positive inside information that Senator Fulbright had once had an affair with one of Ho Chi Minh’s concubines, and that was the real reason he wanted the bombing stopped. That was a mistake. The idea appealed to her and she wanted all the details.
And Sunday afternoon some uninvited people dropped in - a couple I had met there before who had a place over beyond Bedford Village. They weren’t so bad, but they had a guy with them who they said had talked them into coming because he wanted to meet me. His name was Floyd Vance and he said he was a public-relations counselor. Evidently he wanted to meet me because he wanted to meet Nero Wolfe. He was drumming up trade. He said that if anybody needed expert handling of his public image a private detective did, and he would like very much to create a presentation to propose to Nero Wolfe. He also said that if we were working on a case and I would tell him about it, he could use that as a basis for the presentation. When he said that I sharpened my eyes and ears a little, and my tongue, thinking he might be making a stab at detective work himself for somebody, for instance Cyrus M. Jarrett, but decided he was just another character who was so dedicated to improving other people’s images that he had no time left for his own. I met one once who - no, that’s enough for that weekend.

Sometimes it’s things that take the joy out of life, like a blowout when you’re hitting sixty or a button coming off of a shirt when you’re in a hurry, but usually it’s people. Of course, of the three people who had made that weekend less than perfect Amy was the only one whose contribution would carry over. Lily would do some wondering for a week or so - who wouldn’t? - but I certainly wasn’t going to explain. When two people who want to get along start needing to have things explained, look out. I would tell the client about her mother’s real name when I felt like it. <==

THE TROUBLE WITH PUTTING a box number on an ad instead of your name and address and phone number, especially if it’s in three papers, is getting the replies. Phoning at ten o’clock Monday morning and learning that there were some, I went for them, got two at the Times and four at the Gazette, opened them there, and found them so screwy that I bothered to take them home only because I always keep everything connected with a job until it’s finished. One was from a man who said Carlotta Vaughn was his grandmother, and maybe a Carlotta Vaughn was, but he didn’t mention Elinor Denovo.
When I got back a little after eleven Fritz said there had been no calls, but as I entered the office the phone rang and I crossed to my desk, nodding to Wolfe on the way, and got it.
"Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie Goodwin speaking."

As I said, I nearly let it slide by. It hit me a little later as I was telling my jaw and cheek muscles to get set to hide another yawn, and I made a mistake. I forgot the yawn and my jaws opened wide for it. That led me into a second mistake, which often happens. Preferring not to let Thorne know that he had told us a fact which might be significant, I tried to go on as I had been for an hour, looking more awake and alert than I was, and I overdid it. If he had been awake and alert he would have noticed it, but by that time his talking trance was in command and it would have made no impression on him if I had wiggled my ears.
But Wolfe noticed it, and that was what kept him from going on and on and making a night of it unless Thorne ran down. So it was only half past one and they had only got to the middle of Monday afternoon when he looked at the clock and said he was too tired to continue, and Thorne must be too. Miss Denovo would deeply appreciate Thorne’s cooperation, and he and Mr. Goodwin would see if they could find a hint in any of the items Thorne had supplied. As Thorne used both hands on the chair arm to get to his feet I was thinking that I would have to steer him out and down the stoop steps, and possibly even go and get the Heron to cart him home, but he did all right. Going down the hall he put a hand to the wall once to steady himself, and outside he stood and brought his shoulders up and took a couple of deep breaths, but he made it down to the sidewalk without any trouble. I stayed to watch him for about thirty paces. Okay.
As I entered the office Wolfe growled at me, "You got something. What?"


==> I went to my desk and sat. "Nothing would please me more than to catch one you should have caught and missed, but I can’t claim it on this. I think we’ve got a nibble. I don’t know whether it’s the father or the murderer, or possibly both, but I think it’s a nibble. Last Sunday afternoon at Miss Rowan’s place in the country three people came who had not been invited and weren’t expected. Two of them were friends of hers - well, acquaintances; I had met them there before - who have a place half an hour away. The third one was their weekend house guest, a man named Floyd Vance. They said they had mentioned to him that Archie Goodwin was often at Lily Rowan’s for weekends, and he had got them to drive him over because he wanted to meet me. I gathered from what he said that what he really wanted was to meet you. He said he was a public-relations counselor. He said that if anybody needed expert handling of his public image a private detective did, and he would like to create a presentation to propose to you. He also said that if we were working on a case and I would tell him about it, he could use that as a basis for the presentation. At that, naturally, I looked and listened, but decided he was just trying to find another sucker for his racket. I now sincerely hope I was wrong. Two comments. One, there are probably very few Floyd Vances around. Two, allowing for the twenty-three years, he fits Salvatore Manzoni’s description just fine." <==
"I would like some beer," Wolfe said.
"You’re already two bottles ahead and it’s going on two o’clock."
"Satisfactory," he said, leaving it open whether he meant the beer or the nibble. He gripped the edge of the desk to push his chair back, rose, and headed for the hall. For a second I thought he was walking out, to go to bed with the nibble, but he turned left in the hall. He was going for beer. When he returned he had a bottle and a glass in one hand and a snifter in the other. He put the bottle and glass on his desk, got the cognac bottle from the stand and poured a couple of ounces in the snifter.
"You might easily have missed it," he said, and went around to his chair, opened the bottle, and poured.
I whirled the brandy around in the snifter and said, "I almost did. If it’s only a coincidence I’m through with the detective business for good. We’ll soon know, one way or another. The quickest and most obvious would be to have Salvatore Manzoni take a look at the public-relations Floyd Vance, but twenty-three years

I told him it was nothing much this time. "Just a little chore. A man named Floyd Vance has an office at Four-ninety Lexington Avenue. He’s a counselor, but not at law, at public relations, which as you know is a much newer profession. The chore is to ring him and tell him you have a client who is thinking of engaging his services, and you would like to send a man to discuss it with him. The name of the man is Saul Panzer, whose qualifications you know about. He can go any time, the sooner the better. I’m going out, but Saul will be here to take your call. You have the name? Floyd Vance."
"I have it. What if he wants particulars?" "You’re not prepared to give him any."
"That’s a good way to put it. I am certainly not prepared. Give the genius my regards."
He meant it, but he knew I knew exactly what he would put in a long footnote. I dialed another familiar number to make another request and then went up to my room for a quick shave and change. The ten minutes before breakfast hadn’t been enough.

==> t was too hot to walk the more than two miles to East Sixty-third Street, and anyway I had told Lily I would be there by eleven-thirty. It was five minutes short of that when I pushed the button at the penthouse door and got a mild surprise when Mimi opened it. When I am expected at a certain hour it’s nearly always Lily who comes, I think on account of some kind of a notion she has about a maid admitting a man who has a key. I have never tried to dope it. Other people’s notions are none of my business unless they get in the way. Then I got a second mild surprise. I had told Lily on the phone that I wanted to see both her and Miss Denovo, but even so, why were they out on the terrace at that hour with a pitcher of iced tea when they should have been inside working? The penthouse was air-conditioned. Was Lily actually still ... To hell with it. I was working. I moved another chair over, between them, sat, accepted an offer of tea with lime and mint, and said, "Don’t mind my manners, I have a busy day ahead." I turned to Lily. "We’re working on a problem for Miss Denovo. We’ve been on it - " <==
"Archie! No."
That was an example of a client’s notion getting in the way. "I’m talking," I told her distinctly and returned to Lily. "It’s very personal and she doesn’t want anyone to know about it, not even you, and I’m proud and happy that she trusts me so much that she calls me Archie, so about her problem I’ll only say that she is not responsible for it. Other people created it; she merely wants to solve it. She came to see Nero Wolfe two weeks ago today."
"Why do you - " Amy started, and stopped.
Lily was smiling at me. "Ole, Escamillo," she said, and put a kiss on a fingertip and flipped it to me.
"Last night," I told Amy, "there was a development. With Miss Rowan here I can’t give you the details, and I wouldn’t anyhow at this stage. But it is now more than a wild guess that your mother’s death wasn’t just an accidental hit- and-run, that it was deliberate murder, and if so it’s possible that he has ideas about you. We don’t know - "

"Last night," I told Amy, "there was a development. With Miss Rowan here I can’t give you the details, and I wouldn’t anyhow at this stage. But it is now more than a wild guess that your mother’s death wasn’t just an accidental hit- and-run, that it was deliberate murder, and if so it’s possible that he has ideas about you.

t was too hot to walk the more than two miles to East Sixty-third Street, and anyway I had told Lily I would be there by eleven-thirty. It was five minutes short of that when I pushed the button at the penthouse door and got a mild surprise when Mimi opened it. When I am expected at a certain hour it’s nearly always Lily who comes, I think on account of some kind of a notion she has about a maid admitting a man who has a key. I have never tried to dope it. Other people’s notions are none of my business unless they get in the way. Then I got a second mild surprise. I had told Lily on the phone that I wanted to see both her and Miss Denovo, but even so, why were they out on the terrace at that hour with a pitcher of iced tea when they should have been inside working? The penthouse was air-conditioned. Was Lily actually still ... To hell with it. I was working. I moved another chair over, between them, sat, accepted an offer of tea with lime and mint, and said, "Don’t mind my manners, I have a busy day ahead." I turned to Lily. "We’re working on a problem for Miss Denovo. We’ve been on it - "
"Archie! No."
That was an example of a client’s notion getting in the way. "I’m talking," I told her distinctly and returned to Lily. "It’s very personal and she doesn’t want anyone to know about it, not even you, and I’m proud and happy that she trusts me so much that she calls me Archie, so about her problem I’ll only say that she is not responsible for it. Other people created it; she merely wants to solve it. She came to see Nero Wolfe two weeks ago today."
"Why do you - " Amy started, and stopped.

You could get a lot of work done on the book."

Before long the day will come, maybe in a year or two, possibly as many as five, when I won’t be able to write any more of these reports for publication. There will be nothing to report because it will be so close to impossible to move around in the city of New York that doing detective work will be restricted to phone calls and distances you can walk, and what could anyone detect? It took a taxi forty-nine minutes that Friday to cover the four miles from East Sixty-third Street to the building where the New York Telephone Company keeps a file of old directories available for researchers, but once there, I needed only nine minutes to learn that Vance, Floyd, was listed in the 1944 Manhattan directory

 and his address had been Ten East Thirty-ninth Street. It had to be a business address, because there were no residential buildings in that block. That was satisfactory on two counts: one, that he had been around in 1944, and two, that his office had been in walking distance of Tufitti’s restaurant on East Forty-sixth Street for lunch or dinner. The next step, naturally, was to have a look at Ten East Thirty-ninth Street, but it had to wait because Saul was expected for lunch and a conference. When my taxi turned into Thirty-fifth Street from Ninth Avenue, Saul was just getting out of one double-parked in front of the old brownstone.
The next hour, at the lunch table, provided nourishment for both my stomach and brain. For the stomach, sweetbreads amandine in patty shells and cold green-corn pudding. For the brain, a debate on the question whether music, any music, has, or can have, any intellectual content. Wolfe said no and Saul said yes. I backed Saul because he weighs only about half as much as Wolfe, but I thought he made some very good points, which impressed me because one recent Thursday evening at his apartment he had been playing a piece by Debussy, I think it was, on the piano for Lon Cohen and me while we waited for the others to come for poker, and Lon had said something about the piece’s intellectual force, and Saul had said no music could possibly have intellectual force. As the woman said to the parrot, it depends on who you’re talking to.
==> In the office after lunch I told Wolfe what Saul and I had decided about the approach, including my phone calls to Nathaniel Parker and Lily, and then reported. "I did one thing," I said, "and learned one thing. I arranged for the client to stay put in Miss Rowan’s penthouse until further notice, and I learned that in nineteen forty-four Floyd Vance had a telephone at an office at Ten East Thirty-ninth Street. There wasn’t time to go and have a look, but I know that the wreckers haven’t got to that block and the old buildings on the south side are still there. Unless Saul got something hotter we’ll go and surround it." <==
Wolfe looked at Saul.
"Nothing even warm," Saul said. "It always helps to see a subject, but Archie had already seen him, so it’s no news that he’s a middle-aged slouch who may have been quite a fine figure twenty-three years ago. He has two little rooms, with him in one and a blonde with too much lipstick in the other, and when I asked about his past and present clients he either had very little to show or he wasn’t showing me. Of course he wanted to know who Parker’s client was, that

 was natural, but he pressed me on it more than he should have. I was getting so little that I almost made a mistake. I thought of asking him if he had ever had a television producer for a client, but of course I didn’t. I was thinking on my way there that it might be possible to get something with a nice collection of his fingerprints on it, but he was right there with me in that little room. If he locks the door when he leaves that would be no problem. The lock’s an ordinary Wingate. Archie or I could open it with our eyes shut."
Wolfe shook his head. "We have no use for fingerprints now. Possibly later."

"I know, but I thought it would be nice to have them. I mention it only because I can’t match what Archie got - that nineteen forty-four address." Saul looked at me. "It’s still August and the weekend starts in a couple of hours." He got up. "Let’s go, you can plan it on the way."
For two able-bodied, quick-witted, well-trained men Saul and I accomplished a lot in the next two days. He got a haircut, which is quite a feat on a Saturday or Sunday in summer for a man who lives in midtown Manhattan. I detected it when I met him Monday morning. As for me, I frittered away $23.85 of the client’s money on taxi fares and tips between ten a.m. and seven p.m. Saturday, which is also quite a feat. Just three doors away from Ten East Thirty-ninth Street was a lunchroom, Dwyer’s, with a long fountain counter, and the manager told me it had been there for thirty years. He had himself been there nineteen years, and that meant only since 1948, but he knew the name of the man who had preceded him and he had an address in the Bronx where he had lived. The name was Herman Gottschalk, and I spent nine hours trying to track him down so I could show him photographs of seven young women.
That wasn’t dumb; it was merely desperate. Of course the obvious place to look for someone to ask about the tenants and frequenters of that building in 1944 was the building itself, but Saul and I had pretty well covered that Friday afternoon. There was no elevator man or other service man who had been there more-than four years except the building superintendent. He had got the job in 1961, soon after the building had been acquired by its present owner, and he told Saul his predecessor had been there only five years. He didn’t even know the name of the former owner or agent. He did know that none of the present tenants had been there as long as twenty-three years. At the Third Avenue office of the East and West Realty Corporation, the current agent, the only personnel on duty Saturday morning were a girl whose mother should have made her wear teeth braces and an old man with a glass eye who didn’t even know the name of the

 previous owner or agent.
==> I accomplished something else on Sunday. I took Lily Rowan and Amy Denovo to a double-header at Shea Stadium, and got the client back to the penthouse safe and sound. <==
Monday morning a sunburned woman at the East and West Realty Corporation gave us the name of the previous agent, Kauffman Management Company, and at their office on Forty-second Street we were lucky enough to find a smart and active young man who believed in giving service. He spent half an hour looking up old records. The man who had been the superintendent at Ten East Thirty- ninth Street in 1944, named William Polk, had died in 1962. There was no record of the names of any of the service personnel, but there was a complete list of the 1944 tenants - twenty-two of them, counting Floyd Vance - and we copied it. The smart young man said there was no one active in the Kauffman Management Company who had been there for twenty-three years. Bernard Kauffman, who had founded it, was dead.
Saul and I each took half of the list of tenants and went to work on them. I could make a full report on the first four I tackled, but this is not a treatise on economics or sociology. It was the fifth one that rang the gong, a little before five o’clock in the afternoon - a woman named Dorothy Sebor, fifty, gray-haired and blue-eyed and fully as smart as the young man at the Kauffman Management Company - who beaded and probably owned the Sebor Shopping Service in a tenth-floor suite at Rockefeller Center. She was busy. The forty minutes I spent with her wouldn’t have been more than half that if the phone hadn’t interrupted several times, and I might have had a problem getting to her if I hadn’t sent in word that I wanted to ask her something about Ten East Thirty- ninth Street. When I entered her room she asked if I was the Archie Goodwin who worked for Nero Wolfe, and when I said yes she asked, "But what can I possibly tell you about Ten East Thirty-ninth Street? I left eighteen years ago. I loved that dump. Sit down."
I sat. "I don’t know what you can tell me, Miss Sebor, but I know what I want to ask. A job we’re on goes back pretty far and it’s nineteen forty-four we’re interested in. Would you mind telling me what floor you were on?"
"No, why should I? The ninth. In the rear."
"We understand that another of the tenants was named Floyd Vance. Did you

I expected him to start the lip act, but he merely cocked his head. "The point," he said, "is that we don’t know which of two alternative situations faces us. If he is the father but not a murderer, establishing it will be difficult if not impossible. He did that many years ago. But if he is also a murderer the situation is much simpler; he did that only three months ago. We’ll resolve that and then decide how to proceed. Can you get him here this evening?"
"For what? Do I ask him if he still wants to meet you?"
"That would do to start. If he says no, tell him I want to meet him. Tell him I want to ask him why he didn’t reply to the advertisement requesting information about Carlotta Vaughn, alias Elinor Denovo."
I had noted the listing of Vance’s home phone, but got the directory to check on the number, and found that my memory had it right. It was a quarter to seven when I dialed, and if he ate out I would probably get no answer. But after two rings I got a hello.
"Mr. Floyd Vance, please?" "I’m Floyd Vance."
==> "I’m Archie Goodwin. I work for Nero Wolfe. You may remember that we met at Lily Rowan’s place, and you - " <==
"I remember."
"And you said you would like to meet Nero Wolfe to make a proposal. I reminded Mr. Wolfe of that just now when we were discussing something, and he decided he would also like to meet you. Could you come this evening, say at nine o’clock?"

Silence. Five seconds. "This is short notice."
"I know. It’s not as urgent as a five-alarm fire, but if it’s not too inconvenient... the address is - "

"Saul is standing by. So are Fred and Orrie."
"Release them. There is nothing. Our next step is obvious, but it must wait until Mr. Cramer learns his motive. If he learns his motive. He should, with a thousand trained men."
After the sound came of the elevator starting up I sat and looked it over from every angle. It was nice to know the next step was obvious, but it would have been even nicer to know what it was.
15
I DIDN’T KNOW THEN, and I still don’t, exactly how long it took the city employees to find out why Floyd Vance killed Elinor Denovo. I mean really wrap it up. All I know is that Cramer’s phone call didn’t come until 6:38 p.m. Thursday, just in time to make me late at the poker party again. And I still didn’t know what the obvious step was. One of the eighty-seven facts about Wolfe that I would change if I knew how is that he doesn’t believe in talking merely to satisfy anyone’s curiosity, even mine. I admit that in this case there might have been other factors - for instance, he might have wanted to see if I would dope it out for myself and make some suggestions. You probably have, but maybe you wouldn’t if you had been in my shoes, waiting for a development which depended entirely on other people, and you didn’t know what they were doing and not doing.
==> I did do one thing. When I learned from the noon news broadcast on Wednesday that Floyd Vance was being held without bail, and rang Lon Cohen to check it, I phoned Lily Rowan to say I wanted to see the client and was invited to lunch; and after we had finished the lobster salad and cantaloupe mousse and had gone out’ to the terrace, I told Amy that there was no more danger of her being a special target and if she went out for a walk her chances of getting back in one <==

iece were as good as anybody else’s. Naturally she wanted to know what had happened, and Lily did too, and I think that was the first and only time that Lily suspected me of putting on an act in connection with my work. She remembered that she had a date, some kind of a committee meeting, which I doubted, and left me there with Amy. I admit she thought she was being considerate, but it was no favor to me. I had been stalling Amy for two weeks and she wanted to know, and I couldn’t blame her. Usually you can tell a client something, but I had already told her that her mother’s name was Carlotta Vaughn, and there was absolutely nothing that I was ready to add. When I left I wasn’t at all sure that I was still the one man in the world she could trust.
Of course I read every word in the Wednesday and Thursday papers about the hit-and-run driver the police had nabbed after three months, but learned nothing about motive. I got the impression that the fingerprints which had identified him had been secured by extremely competent detective work by the Homicide Bureau, but there were no published details about it. There was no mention of Nero Wolfe or Archie Goodwin. There was a lot of new information, new to me, about Floyd Vance, and one item cleared up a point that I had wondered about. In 1944 he had been in his late twenties and single, and why hadn’t he been sent, either to Europe or to Asia, to help several million of his fellow citizens do some expert handling of the public image of the United States of America? According to Wednesday’s Gazette and News, and Thursday’s Times, he had been excused because he had some kind of a trick knee. Other items, though they cleared up nothing, told me more about him - for instance, that he had always been a tadpole in a big frog pond as a public-relations counselor. Evidently he had had very little effect on the dignity of man, either way.
When the phone rang at 6:38 p.m. Thursday, I was at my desk working on germination records and Wolfe was at his with a book he had just started on, an advance copy of The Future of Germany, by Karl Jaspers. I reached for the receiver.
"Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie - "

When I left I wasn’t at all sure that I was still the one man in the world she could trust. <==
Of course I read every word in the Wednesday and Thursday papers about the hit-and-run driver the police had nabbed after three months, but learned nothing about motive. I got the impression that the fingerprints which had identified him had been secured by extremely competent detective work by the Homicide Bureau, but there were no published details about it. There was no mention of Nero Wolfe or Archie Goodwin. There was a lot of new information, new to me, about Floyd Vance, and one item cleared up a point that I had wondered about. In 1944 he had been in his late twenties and single, and why hadn’t he been sent, either to Europe or to Asia, to help several million of his fellow citizens do some expert handling of the public image of the United States of America? According to Wednesday’s Gazette and News, and Thursday’s Times, he had been excused because he had some kind of a trick knee. Other items, though they cleared up nothing, told me more about him - for instance, that he had always been a tadpole in a big frog pond as a public-relations counselor. Evidently he had had very little effect on the dignity of man, either way.
When the phone rang at 6:38 p.m. Thursday, I was at my desk working on germination records and Wolfe was at his with a book he had just started on, an advance copy of The Future of Germany, by Karl Jaspers. I reached for the receiver.
"Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie - "
"I want Wolfe, Goodwin. Cramer."
"Greetings." Without bothering to cover the transmitter, I turned my head and said, "Cramer," perhaps a little louder than usual, and Wolfe reached for his phone, perhaps a little faster than usual. I kept mine.

==> IT HAPPENS ONCE or twice a week. Lily Rowan and I, returning from a show or party or hockey game, leave the elevator and approach the door of her penthouse on top of the apartment building on Sixty-third Street between Madison and Park, and there is the key question.

That Thursday afternoon in August we had been to Shea Stadium to watch the Mets clobber the Giants, which they had done, 8 to 3, and it was only twenty past five when she used her key.

By the time I got out to the terrace with the tray she was there, at a table under the awning, studying the scorecard I had kept.
"Yes, sir," she said as I put the tray down, "Harrelson got three hits and batted in two runs. If he was here I’d hug him. Good."
"Then I’m glad he’s not here." I gave her her drink and sat. "If you hugged that kid good you’d crack a rib."

==> A voice came. "I’m going, Miss Rowan." <==
Our heads turned. The young woman in the doorway to the living room was a

 newcomer to the penthouse. I had seen her only twice, and she was easy to look at, with just enough round places, just round enough, properly spotted on her five-foot-four getup, and her warm dark skin just right for her quick brown eyes. Her dark-brown hair was bunched at the back. Her name was Amy Denovo and she had got a diploma from Smith in June. Lily had hired her ten days ago, at a hundred a week, to help her find and arrange material for a book a man was going to write about Lily’s father, who had made a pile building sewers and other items and had left her enough boodle to keep a dozen penthouses.
She answered a couple of questions Lily asked, and left, and we talked baseball, concentrating on what the Mets had, if anything, besides Tommy Davis and Bud Harrelson and Tom Seaver, and what they might have if we lived long enough. We dawdled with the drinks, and at six o’clock I got up to go, leaving Lily plenty of time to change for a dinner she had been hooked for, where people were going to abolish ghettos by making speeches. I had a date, later, where I intended to abolish the welfare of some friends of mine by drawing another ace or maybe jack.
But down in the lobby I was intercepted. Albert, the doorman, was moving to open the door for me when a voice spoke my name and I turned, and Amy Denovo left a chair and was coming. She gave me a nice little smile and said, "Could you give me a few minutes to ask you something?"

The door opened and two women entered and headed for the elevator. That was
not the place to discuss very personal matters.
She was all right to walk with, no leading or lagging and no silly step-stretching. At that time of day in August there was plenty of room in the back at The Cooler, and we got the corner table where Lily and I had often had a snack. When the waitress had taken our order and left, I asked if she wanted to put off being personal until we had something inside.
She shook her head. "I might as well ..." She let it hang ten seconds and then blurted, "I want you to find my father."
I raised a brow. "Have you lost him?"
==> "No. I haven’t lost him ... because I never had him." She said it fast, as if someone was trying to stop her. "I decided I had to tell somebody - that was a month ago - and then I got this job with Miss Rowan and I found out that she knows you, and I met you, and of course I know about you and Nero Wolfe. But I don’t want Nero Wolfe to do it, I want you to." <==
There were no dimples, and the quick brown eyes were fastened on me.
"That won’t work," I told her. "I’m on full time with Mr. Wolfe, twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week when they’re needed, and I don’t take jobs on my own. But I have a loose hour" - I looked at my watch - "and twenty minutes, and if you want a suggestion I might possibly have one. No charge."
"But I need more than a suggestion."
"You’re not in a position to judge. You’re too involved."

"Certainly I’ll tell you. I have never earned any money, not enough to mention, and anyway I’ve spent it. I only have what my mother left, after paying the ... for the cremation. She left instructions about that. There’s a little more than two thousand dollars in the bank, that’s all. There are no debts and I don’t owe anyone anything."
I had a brow up. "What did your mother do for - no, that’s immaterial. She made enough to send you to an expensive college. Unless someone helped?"
"No. She did it all. You were going to ask what she did for a living. She was with a television producer, the same one from as far back as I can remember. I suppose she got fifteen thousand a year, maybe more. She never told me." The quick brown eyes were straight at me. "If I paid Nero Wolfe the two thousand dollars he would have you work on it, wouldn’t he?"
I shook my head. "He wouldn’t even discuss it. He would know it might take a year, and he thinks nothing of billing a client five grand for a one-week job. You said you know about him, but apparently you don’t. He’s pigheaded and high- nosed and toplofty, and he thinks he’s the best detective in the world, and so do I, or I would have moved out long ago. I think you deserve some help with your problem, and you certainly need it, and I like your dimples, but if I told him about you and suggested an appointment he would just glare at me. He would

==>  think I had a hinge loose. I do have one idea that you might want to consider. Miss Rowan likes to do things for people, and she has a stack, and if you - " <==
"Don’t you dare tell her about me!"
"Keep your seat. I wouldn’t dream of telling her, or anyone. I merely thought you might tell her yourself, and - "
"I wouldn’t tell anybody!"
"Okay, I won’t either. Your eyes have a fine flash." I regarded her. "Look, Miss Denovo. I’m shutting the door only because I have to. Myself, I would like to tackle it because it would probably have some interesting angles and twists and it would be nice to have a client it is a pleasure to look at. Besides, there would be the possibility of having to deal with a murder. When you hear about - "
"Murder?"

"I can assume it’s in your possession legally?"
"Of course." She was still frowning. "I didn’t rob a bank."
"It’s still in your possession until he takes the job." I handed her the parcel. "It may take me five minutes or it could be half an hour. If you get tired waiting, there are magazines on the table." I started for the connecting door to the office but decided to go around, and went to the door to the hall instead.

Wolfe was at his desk with his current book, Incredible Victory, by Walter Lord. He probably hadn’t got much reading in at Hewitt’s and would have to catch up. I went to my desk, sat facing him, and waited for him to finish a paragraph. It must have been a long one. He looked up and growled. "Something?"
==> "Somebody," I said. "A girl in the front room named Amy Denovo. I believe I mentioned a while back that Miss Rowan was collecting material for a book about her father, and she hired this girl to help, and I met her there last week. As I was leaving there yesterday afternoon she - the girl - stopped me down in the lobby and we went to a place and had egg-and-anchovy sandwiches which I have told Fritz about but he wasn’t interested. She wanted me to do a job for her because I am the one man in the world she can trust, and I told her I couldn’t because I already had a job, and she said then she would hire you if I would do the work, and I explained that I always do the work. Of course the next question, my question, was about money, and I asked it. She said she had two thousand dollars in the bank, left to her by her mother, and that’s all. No other resources and no prospects. Since the job would be complicated and might take months and no telling what expenses, I told her nothing doing, I wouldn’t even mention it to you. I was sorry because - " <==
"Pfui." He grunted. "Why do you mention it now?"
"I’ll finish the sentence. I was sorry because the job would probably be interesting, and tough, and it has none of the aspects that you won’t touch. I mention it now because she is in the front room with a package wrapped in newspaper containing two hundred hundred-dollar-bills, twenty thousand dollars, which she wants you to take as a retainer."
"Where did she get it?"
"I don’t know. She says it’s in her possession legally."
He put his bookmark, a thin strip of gold that was a gift from a client, at his page and put the book down. "What was said yesterday. In full."

"He would do his share, directed by me except when urgency forbids. The

 money is in that parcel? May I see it?"
She got up and handed it to him and returned to the chair. He removed the rubber bands and wrapping and took a look at each batch, all twenty of them, stacking them neatly on his desk. He turned to me. "I see no indication of source. Did you?"
I said no.
==> He turned to her. "Did Miss Lily Rowan supply it?" <==
"Of course not!"
"But of course someone did. In view of what you told Mr. Goodwin yesterday, I would have to know the source of this money. Where and how did you get it?"
Her lips were tight. She opened them to say, "I don’t see why you have to know that. There’s nothing wrong with the way I got it. It’s mine. If I went to a store to buy something and gave them one of those bills they wouldn’t ask me where I got it."
He shook his head. "Not a parallel, Miss Denovo. Yesterday you told Mr. Goodwin that two thousand dollars in the bank was all you had, and you rejected his suggestion that you ask Miss Rowan to help you." He tapped the stack. "This is ten times two thousand. If it was a loan or a gift I would have to know from whom. If you sold something I would have to know what you sold and to whom. You may not know, at your age, that that is merely reasonable prudence. To accept a substantial retainer for a difficult and complicated operation without assurance of its legitimacy would be asinine, and if you won’t tell me where you got this money I won’t take it. If you do tell me it will have to be verified, with proper discretion, but to my satisfaction."
She was frowning again, not at him, at me, but it wasn’t really for me; it was for the problem she had been handed. But when she spoke it was to me and for me, a question: "Is he right, Mr. Goodwin? Or is he just shutting the door, as you did?"

I said no.

"No," I said, "I’m afraid he’s right. As he said, just reasonable prudence. And after all, if it’s yours legally, as you told me, and if there’s nothing wrong with the way you got it, as you told him, why not spill it? It can’t be a deeper secret

 than the one we already know."
She looked at Wolfe and back at me. "I could tell you," she said. "Okay, tell me, and we’ll pretend he’s not here."

He grunted and turned to her. "Is the money still in the box?"
"Yes, all but that." She gestured toward his desk. "The box is in my apartment - on Eighty-second Street. And the letter. But I don’t want ... Mr. Goodwin mentioned the Internal Revenue Service."
"We are not government agents, Miss Denovo, and are not obliged to disclose information received in confidence." He swiveled his head to look at the clock.

 "It is ten minutes to our dinnertime. May Mr. Goodwin call on you at your apartment at ten tomorrow morning?"
==> "Yes. I don’t go to Miss Rowan on Saturday." <==
"Then expect him around ten o’clock. He will want to see the box and its contents, and the letter, and he will want all the information you can give him. What you told him yesterday is a mere prologue." He turned. "Archie. Give her a receipt for this money. Not as a retainer; that can wait until you have seen the box and the letter, and you will verify the handwriting of the letter. Just a receipt for the amount, her property, entrusted to me for safekeeping."
I turned my chair, pulled the typewriter around, and opened a drawer for paper and carbon.

I WAS INTERESTED, naturally, in Elinor Denovo’s apartment. We were probably going to need to know everything about her that was knowable, and a woman’s home can have a hundred hints, two or three of which you may get if you have any savvy at all and are lucky. So before settling down with Amy and my notebook in the living room I took a tour, with Amy along. There were a small foyer, a medium-sized living room, two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a small kitchen. If the foyer or kitchen or bathroom had any hints they weren’t for me; for instance, there was nothing in the bathroom to indicate that it had ever been used by a man, but of course Elinor hadn’t been there for nearly three months.
I gave Amy’s bedroom just a glance; for her I had a better source of hints, herself. She said she hadn’t changed anything in her mother’s bedroom. It might have told a woman, especially a Lily Rowan, a lot, but all I got was that she had liked pale green for drapes and the bed cover, she used three different scents, all expensive, and she didn’t mind if the rug had a big spot near the bathroom door. The living room did have a few hints which might help or might not. There were five pictures on the walls, and they were all color reproductions of paintings by Georgia O’Keeffe - data supplied by Amy. I would have to check on O’Keeffe. The only piece of furniture that was upholstered was the couch, and there were only two cushions on it. I have seen couches with a dozen. The four chairs didn’t match one another, and none of them matched the couch. The books, seven

 whole shelves of them, were such a mixture, all kinds, fiction and nonfiction, that after I had looked at twenty or thirty titles I quit.
The one really good hint, if someone would tell me what it meant, was that there were no photographs. Except for those in Amy’s room, which belonged to her, there wasn’t a single photograph in the place, not one, of anyone or anything. That was hard to believe, but Amy said that as far as she knew there had never been any, and she had none of her mother, not even a snapshot, which was a setback, since we would certainly want to know what Elinor Denovo had looked like. I would probably have had to look long and far to find another middle-aged woman who had died, or would die, absolutely photographless.
There were papers, letters, and paid bills and miscellaneous items, including the stuff from her room at the office, but there was no diary or anything resembling one, and there was nothing that seemed likely to be of any help. If it got too tough I might have to have another go at it or put Saul Panzer on it. I did use a few of the items, in Elinor’s handwriting, to check the writing on the letter that was in the box with the money. It geed.
When I finally sat on the couch with my notebook, with Amy on one side and the box on the other, it was getting on toward noon. Amy looked two years younger; she hadn’t bunched her hair and it was dancing around when she moved her head. I got a piece of folded paper from my breast pocket.

As I said, I nearly let it slide by. It hit me a little later as I was telling my jaw and cheek muscles to get set to hide another yawn, and I made a mistake. I forgot the yawn and my jaws opened wide for it. That led me into a second mistake, which often happens. Preferring not to let Thorne know that he had told us a fact which might be significant, I tried to go on as I had been for an hour, looking more awake and alert than I was, and I overdid it. If he had been awake and alert he would have noticed it, but by that time his talking trance was in command and it would have made no impression on him if I had wiggled my ears.
But Wolfe noticed it, and that was what kept him from going on and on and making a night of it unless Thorne ran down. So it was only half past one and they had only got to the middle of Monday afternoon when he looked at the clock and said he was too tired to continue, and Thorne must be too. Miss Denovo would deeply appreciate Thorne’s cooperation, and he and Mr. Goodwin would see if they could find a hint in any of the items Thorne had supplied. As Thorne used both hands on the chair arm to get to his feet I was thinking that I would have to steer him out and down the stoop steps, and possibly even go and get the Heron to cart him home, but he did all right. Going down the hall he put a hand to the wall once to steady himself, and outside he stood and brought his shoulders up and took a couple of deep breaths, but he made it down to the sidewalk without any trouble. I stayed to watch him for about thirty paces. Okay.
As I entered the office Wolfe growled at me, "You got something. What?"


==> I went to my desk and sat. "Nothing would please me more than to catch one you should have caught and missed, but I can’t claim it on this. I think we’ve got a nibble. I don’t know whether it’s the father or the murderer, or possibly both, but I think it’s a nibble. Last Sunday afternoon at Miss Rowan’s place in the country three people came who had not been invited and weren’t expected. Two of them were friends of hers - well, acquaintances; I had met them there before - who have a place half an hour away. The third one was their weekend house guest, a man named Floyd Vance. They said they had mentioned to him that Archie Goodwin was often at Lily Rowan’s for weekends, and he had got them to drive him over because he wanted to meet me. I gathered from what he said that what he really wanted was to meet you. He said he was a public-relations counselor. He said that if anybody needed expert handling of his public image a private detective did, and he would like to create a presentation to propose to you. He also said that if we were working on a case and I would tell him about it, he could use that as a basis for the presentation. At that, naturally, I looked and listened, but decided he was just trying to find another sucker for his racket. I now sincerely hope I was wrong. Two comments. One, there are probably very few Floyd Vances around. Two, allowing for the twenty-three years, he fits Salvatore Manzoni’s description just fine." <==
"I would like some beer," Wolfe said.
"You’re already two bottles ahead and it’s going on two o’clock."
"Satisfactory," he said, leaving it open whether he meant the beer or the nibble. He gripped the edge of the desk to push his chair back, rose, and headed for the hall. For a second I thought he was walking out, to go to bed with the nibble, but he turned left in the hall. He was going for beer. When he returned he had a bottle and a glass in one hand and a snifter in the other. He put the bottle and glass on his desk, got the cognac bottle from the stand and poured a couple of ounces in the snifter.
"You might easily have missed it," he said, and went around to his chair, opened the bottle, and poured.
I whirled the brandy around in the snifter and said, "I almost did. If it’s only a coincidence I’m through with the detective business for good. We’ll soon know, one way or another. The quickest and most obvious would be to have Salvatore Manzoni take a look at the public-relations Floyd Vance, but twenty-three years

I glared at the clock on the bedstand, realized that it actually said twenty-five minutes past eight, and swung my feet around. Figuring out whether I had failed to turn the alarm on, or it had tried to stir me and it had failed, would have to wait. I called for will power, gave it time to deliver, made it to my feet, concentrated on locating the door, and stepped.
The door of Wolfe’s room, which is above the kitchen, at the rear of the house where he gets the sun in winter, stood open. When I entered, with my bare feet making no sound, he was seated at the table, with the Times propped on the rack, dropping a bit of toast into the sauce of eggs au beurre noir. When I cleared my throat he got the toast to and into his mouth before he turned his head.
"The time is out of joint," I said.
He frowned. "I don’t talk in quotations, even Shakespeare, and neither do you."

==> Miss Rowan does sometimes and she likes that one. As you see, I am no longer on daylight saving. Apparently you are." He was fully dressed: a nice clean yellow shirt with narrow maroon stripes, a maroon tie, and a brown summerweight self-striped suit. Up in the plant rooms he would shed the jacket and put on a smock. <==
He swallowed a bite of egg and said, "It’s nearly nine o’clock."
"By daylight saving, yes, sir. I’ll brief them while I’m eating breakfast."
"Only Saul. We won’t risk it with Fred and Orrie. Tell them to be on call. You and Saul will decide on your approach and you may need them later. First, is he involved? If yes, merely as the murderer, with a motive that doesn’t concern us, or also as the father? We can’t waste our time and the client’s money just on finding a culprit for Mr. Cramer." He dropped toast in the sauce.
"I’m waking up," I said. "Or I got ideas in my sleep. Last night I said we don’t have to answer the question how he knew we were on it, but if he’s the father it may be important. If he’s the father there’s some connection between him and Cyrus Jarrett, or why did Jarrett send the checks? And if Jarrett told him that Nero Wolfe is out to find the father, and if he is also the murderer, what about Miss Denovo? We might lose a client. I doubt if you want another casualty like Simon Jacobs on the record, and I certainly don’t. I suggest that we’d better get her out of circulation."
He made a face. "Fritz."

I doubt if you want another casualty like Simon Jacobs on the record, and I certainly don’t. I suggest that we’d better get her out of circulation."
He made a face. "Fritz."
That was what he calls flummery. It was true that when, for security reasons, it had been necessary to have a female guest sleeping and eating in the South Room, which is above Wolfe’s, Fritz hadn’t been able to hide how he felt about it, but Wolfe hadn’t even tried to hide how he felt.
==> "I’m aware," I said, "that if we did it again Fritz might leave and you might too. I don’t mean here. She spends most of her days at Miss Rowan’s, and she could spend her nights there too until we get him or drop him. Miss Rowan has two spare rooms. I’ll suggest it. Anything else?" <==
He said no and I went back up a flight to do in ten minutes what usually takes me thirty. By the time I got down to the kitchen, having stopped in the office to tell Fred and Orrie that Saul and I were going to pick up a trail and might need them later, my fog was starting to clear.


A detective is supposed to get onto things and people, but I gave up long ago trying to get onto Fritz all the way, so I didn’t bother to try to guess how he had known Fred and Orrie would be leaving and Saul would be staying. He knows Saul loves his eggs au beurre noir, and there were two chairs and two places ready at my breakfast table. Saul went to the range to watch him baste, and said he had tried it a hundred times but it never tasted the same. As we ate I told Saul about Floyd Vance and the various angles, and we took our second cups of coffee to the office to consider ways and means. Wolfe had said that the first question was, Is he involved? but Saul agreed with me that it couldn’t do any harm to regard that as answered and proceed accordingly. He also agreed that it would help if he had a look at him, and I got at the phone and dialed the number of Nathaniel Parker, the lawyer.
"Yes, Archie?" I like the way Parker says yes, Archie. He knows that handling something for Wolfe can be interesting but that it may be tough and ticklish, so the yes, Archie is half glad and half sad.

t was too hot to walk the more than two miles to East Sixty-third Street, and anyway I had told Lily I would be there by eleven-thirty. It was five minutes short of that when I pushed the button at the penthouse door and got a mild surprise when Mimi opened it. When I am expected at a certain hour it’s nearly always Lily who comes, I think on account of some kind of a notion she has about a maid admitting a man who has a key. I have never tried to dope it. Other people’s notions are none of my business unless they get in the way. Then I got a second mild surprise. I had told Lily on the phone that I wanted to see both her and Miss Denovo, but even so, why were they out on the terrace at that hour with a pitcher of iced tea when they should have been inside working? The penthouse was air-conditioned. Was Lily actually still ... To hell with it. I was working. I moved another chair over, between them, sat, accepted an offer of tea with lime and mint, and said, "Don’t mind my manners, I have a busy day ahead." I turned to Lily. "We’re working on a problem for Miss Denovo. We’ve been on it - "
"Archie! No."
That was an example of a client’s notion getting in the way. "I’m talking," I told her distinctly and returned to Lily. "It’s very personal and she doesn’t want anyone to know about it, not even you, and I’m proud and happy that she trusts me so much that she calls me Archie, so about her problem I’ll only say that she is not responsible for it. Other people created it; she merely wants to solve it. She came to see Nero Wolfe two weeks ago today."
"Why do you - " Amy started, and stopped.
Lily was smiling at me. "Ole, Escamillo," she said, and put a kiss on a fingertip and flipped it to me.
==> "Last night," I told Amy, "there was a development. With Miss Rowan here I can’t give you the details, and I wouldn’t anyhow at this stage. But it is now more than a wild guess that your mother’s death wasn’t just an accidental hit- and-run, that it was deliberate murder, and if so it’s possible that he has ideas about you. We don’t know - " <==
"He? Who?"
"You have probably never heard the name we’re interested in, and you won’t hear it now. We don’t know what motive he might have had for your mother, or

f he has one for you, but once in a situation like this we made a bad mistake and once is enough." I turned to Lily. "Can she stay here? I mean stay. Not even go out in the hall. This terrace is okay; I doubt if he has a helicopter. Until we know more than we do now. Perhaps just a couple of days, but it could be a couple of weeks. You could get a lot of work done on the book."
"Why not?" Lily said. "Certainly."

==> Amy was squinting at me, squinting and frowning. "But you can’t expect me ... You can’t just tell me ..." She looked at Lily. "If you don’t mind, Miss Rowan, I want to ask him something. I mean alone." <==
"I don’t mind," Lily said, "but I know him better than you do. He’s working. When he’s playing he’s wonderful - usually - but when he’s working he’s impossible. He said he wouldn’t give you any details, but if you want to try I don’t mind."
"I do," I told Amy. "I’ve got things to do, and anyway there’s nothing I could or would tell you. This development may be a dud, and I’ve got to find out." I stood up. "You’ll want to go to your apartment to bring things, but don’t take all day." To Lily: "The standard rate for bodyguarding is six dollars an hour, but you shouldn’t count the hours you’re working on the book."
"May I take her to the country for the weekend?"
"No. It’s barely possible we’ll need her."
"You didn’t drink the tea."

"And I’m thirsty." I picked up the glass, took a couple of swallows, kissed the top of her head, and went.
Before long the day will come, maybe in a year or two, possibly as many as five, when I won’t be able to write any more of these reports for publication. There will be nothing to report because it will be so close to impossible to move around in the city of New York that doing detective work will be restricted to phone calls and distances you can walk, and what could anyone detect? It took a taxi forty-nine minutes that Friday to cover the four miles from East Sixty-third Street to the building where the New York Telephone Company keeps a file of old directories available for researchers, but once there, I needed only nine minutes to learn that Vance, Floyd, was listed in the 1944 Manhattan directory

 and his address had been Ten East Thirty-ninth Street. It had to be a business address, because there were no residential buildings in that block. That was satisfactory on two counts: one, that he had been around in 1944, and two, that his office had been in walking distance of Tufitti’s restaurant on East Forty-sixth Street for lunch or dinner. The next step, naturally, was to have a look at Ten East Thirty-ninth Street, but it had to wait because Saul was expected for lunch and a conference. When my taxi turned into Thirty-fifth Street from Ninth Avenue, Saul was just getting out of one double-parked in front of the old brownstone.
The next hour, at the lunch table, provided nourishment for both my stomach and brain. For the stomach, sweetbreads amandine in patty shells and cold green-corn pudding. For the brain, a debate on the question whether music, any music, has, or can have, any intellectual content. Wolfe said no and Saul said yes. I backed Saul because he weighs only about half as much as Wolfe, but I thought he made some very good points, which impressed me because one recent Thursday evening at his apartment he had been playing a piece by Debussy, I think it was, on the piano for Lon Cohen and me while we waited for the others to come for poker, and Lon had said something about the piece’s intellectual force, and Saul had said no music could possibly have intellectual force. As the woman said to the parrot, it depends on who you’re talking to.
==> In the office after lunch I told Wolfe what Saul and I had decided about the approach, including my phone calls to Nathaniel Parker and Lily, and then reported. "I did one thing," I said, "and learned one thing. I arranged for the client to stay put in Miss Rowan’s penthouse until further notice, and I learned that in nineteen forty-four Floyd Vance had a telephone at an office at Ten East Thirty-ninth Street. There wasn’t time to go and have a look, but I know that the wreckers haven’t got to that block and the old buildings on the south side are still there. Unless Saul got something hotter we’ll go and surround it." <==
Wolfe looked at Saul.
"Nothing even warm," Saul said. "It always helps to see a subject, but Archie had already seen him, so it’s no news that he’s a middle-aged slouch who may have been quite a fine figure twenty-three years ago. He has two little rooms, with him in one and a blonde with too much lipstick in the other, and when I asked about his past and present clients he either had very little to show or he wasn’t showing me. Of course he wanted to know who Parker’s client was, that

 was natural, but he pressed me on it more than he should have. I was getting so little that I almost made a mistake. I thought of asking him if he had ever had a television producer for a client, but of course I didn’t. I was thinking on my way there that it might be possible to get something with a nice collection of his fingerprints on it, but he was right there with me in that little room. If he locks the door when he leaves that would be no problem. The lock’s an ordinary Wingate. Archie or I could open it with our eyes shut."
Wolfe shook his head. "We have no use for fingerprints now. Possibly later."

"I know, but I thought it would be nice to have them. I mention it only because I can’t match what Archie got - that nineteen forty-four address." Saul looked at me. "It’s still August and the weekend starts in a couple of hours." He got up. "Let’s go, you can plan it on the way."
For two able-bodied, quick-witted, well-trained men Saul and I accomplished a lot in the next two days. He got a haircut, which is quite a feat on a Saturday or Sunday in summer for a man who lives in midtown Manhattan. I detected it when I met him Monday morning. As for me, I frittered away $23.85 of the client’s money on taxi fares and tips between ten a.m. and seven p.m. Saturday, which is also quite a feat. Just three doors away from Ten East Thirty-ninth Street was a lunchroom, Dwyer’s, with a long fountain counter, and the manager told me it had been there for thirty years. He had himself been there nineteen years, and that meant only since 1948, but he knew the name of the man who had preceded him and he had an address in the Bronx where he had lived. The name was Herman Gottschalk, and I spent nine hours trying to track him down so I could show him photographs of seven young women.
That wasn’t dumb; it was merely desperate. Of course the obvious place to look for someone to ask about the tenants and frequenters of that building in 1944 was the building itself, but Saul and I had pretty well covered that Friday afternoon. There was no elevator man or other service man who had been there more-than four years except the building superintendent. He had got the job in 1961, soon after the building had been acquired by its present owner, and he told Saul his predecessor had been there only five years. He didn’t even know the name of the former owner or agent. He did know that none of the present tenants had been there as long as twenty-three years. At the Third Avenue office of the East and West Realty Corporation, the current agent, the only personnel on duty Saturday morning were a girl whose mother should have made her wear teeth braces and an old man with a glass eye who didn’t even know the name of the

 previous owner or agent.
==> I accomplished something else on Sunday. I took Lily Rowan and Amy Denovo to a double-header at Shea Stadium, and got the client back to the penthouse safe and sound. <==
Monday morning a sunburned woman at the East and West Realty Corporation gave us the name of the previous agent, Kauffman Management Company, and at their office on Forty-second Street we were lucky enough to find a smart and active young man who believed in giving service. He spent half an hour looking up old records. The man who had been the superintendent at Ten East Thirty- ninth Street in 1944, named William Polk, had died in 1962. There was no record of the names of any of the service personnel, but there was a complete list of the 1944 tenants - twenty-two of them, counting Floyd Vance - and we copied it. The smart young man said there was no one active in the Kauffman Management Company who had been there for twenty-three years. Bernard Kauffman, who had founded it, was dead.
Saul and I each took half of the list of tenants and went to work on them. I could make a full report on the first four I tackled, but this is not a treatise on economics or sociology. It was the fifth one that rang the gong, a little before five o’clock in the afternoon - a woman named Dorothy Sebor, fifty, gray-haired and blue-eyed and fully as smart as the young man at the Kauffman Management Company - who beaded and probably owned the Sebor Shopping Service in a tenth-floor suite at Rockefeller Center. She was busy. The forty minutes I spent with her wouldn’t have been more than half that if the phone hadn’t interrupted several times, and I might have had a problem getting to her if I hadn’t sent in word that I wanted to ask her something about Ten East Thirty- ninth Street. When I entered her room she asked if I was the Archie Goodwin who worked for Nero Wolfe, and when I said yes she asked, "But what can I possibly tell you about Ten East Thirty-ninth Street? I left eighteen years ago. I loved that dump. Sit down."
I sat. "I don’t know what you can tell me, Miss Sebor, but I know what I want to ask. A job we’re on goes back pretty far and it’s nineteen forty-four we’re interested in. Would you mind telling me what floor you were on?"
"No, why should I? The ninth. In the rear."
"We understand that another of the tenants was named Floyd Vance. Did you

I expected him to start the lip act, but he merely cocked his head. "The point," he said, "is that we don’t know which of two alternative situations faces us. If he is the father but not a murderer, establishing it will be difficult if not impossible. He did that many years ago. But if he is also a murderer the situation is much simpler; he did that only three months ago. We’ll resolve that and then decide how to proceed. Can you get him here this evening?"
"For what? Do I ask him if he still wants to meet you?"
"That would do to start. If he says no, tell him I want to meet him. Tell him I want to ask him why he didn’t reply to the advertisement requesting information about Carlotta Vaughn, alias Elinor Denovo."
I had noted the listing of Vance’s home phone, but got the directory to check on the number, and found that my memory had it right. It was a quarter to seven when I dialed, and if he ate out I would probably get no answer. But after two rings I got a hello.
"Mr. Floyd Vance, please?" "I’m Floyd Vance."
==> "I’m Archie Goodwin. I work for Nero Wolfe. You may remember that we met at Lily Rowan’s place, and you - " <==
"I remember."
"And you said you would like to meet Nero Wolfe to make a proposal. I reminded Mr. Wolfe of that just now when we were discussing something, and he decided he would also like to meet you. Could you come this evening, say at nine o’clock?"

Silence. Five seconds. "This is short notice."
"I know. It’s not as urgent as a five-alarm fire, but if it’s not too inconvenient... the address is - "

 he could solve any problem on earth or in outer space by leaning back and closing his eyes and working his lips. The trouble was that the little chores Saul and I did for him were nearly always done somewhere else, but that time it was going on right there in his office, before his eyes. I was surprised that he didn’t get up and go to the kitchen.
Amy’s father rang the doorbell at ten after nine. As I went to admit him Saul headed for the connecting door to the front room, and as I took him to the office and to the red leather chair I did something that I had done many times although I had learned long ago that it was absolutely useless. For a spectator in a courtroom to try to decide from a man’s looks if he’s guilty or not is natural and he has to pass the time somehow, but for a working detective it’s pure crap. So I did it again. I looked at Vance’s purled eyes, flabby cheeks, thin hair, saggy shoulders, down to his brown shoes that needed a shine, actually hoping to get a slant on the question, Did he kill Elinor Denovo? Nuts.
By the time I got to nuts Wolfe was saying, "... not that I scorn all trite expressions; some of the finest words and phrases in the language were once vulgarisms and are well worn. But a faddish cliché like ‘image’ as now abused is an abomination. You told Mr. Goodwin that my ‘public image’ needs expert handling and you would like to meet me. If you have some proposal to make I’ll listen as a matter of courtesy, but don’t call my repute my image."
"To hell with your courtesy. Shove it." Vance’s voice was not as I remembered it. I had thought he was a fairly smooth talker that Sunday, but now the words came out blurry. He went on, "I’ve learned something about you since I talked with Goodwin. You don’t give a damn about your public image. Did you get me here just to tell me you don’t like clichés? Do I go home now?"
==> Wolfe nodded. "That’s your question, why I got you here. My question is, Why did you come? I doubt if either of us expects a candid answer. In fact, Mr. Vance, I’m in some confusion about my objective. One possibility is that I would like to know why you prevailed on your friends to drive you to Miss Rowan’s so you could meet Mr. Goodwin. Another possibility is that I would like to know why you made several attempts to see Mrs. Elinor Denovo last May. Still another is that I want to ask you about your association with Miss Carlotta Vaughn in the summer of nineteen forty-four. And again, another is that I wondered why you didn’t reply to an advertisement which appeared - " <==

Jesus. Give me a pad and pencil. I’ll have to make notes."
We hadn’t wiped a pad. You can’t think of everything. I got one from a drawer, and a pencil, and went with them, and he took them, probably because he was uncertain what to do with his tongue and so was glad to have something to do with his hands.
"As you see," Wolfe said, "I have - since you fancy clichés - an embarrassment of riches." His head tilted; I hadn’t sat. "Beer, please, Archie?"
"Yes, sir." I took a step and stopped. "Something wet, Mr. Vance?"

"Saul is standing by. So are Fred and Orrie."
"Release them. There is nothing. Our next step is obvious, but it must wait until Mr. Cramer learns his motive. If he learns his motive. He should, with a thousand trained men."
After the sound came of the elevator starting up I sat and looked it over from every angle. It was nice to know the next step was obvious, but it would have been even nicer to know what it was.
15
I DIDN’T KNOW THEN, and I still don’t, exactly how long it took the city employees to find out why Floyd Vance killed Elinor Denovo. I mean really wrap it up. All I know is that Cramer’s phone call didn’t come until 6:38 p.m. Thursday, just in time to make me late at the poker party again. And I still didn’t know what the obvious step was. One of the eighty-seven facts about Wolfe that I would change if I knew how is that he doesn’t believe in talking merely to satisfy anyone’s curiosity, even mine. I admit that in this case there might have been other factors - for instance, he might have wanted to see if I would dope it out for myself and make some suggestions. You probably have, but maybe you wouldn’t if you had been in my shoes, waiting for a development which depended entirely on other people, and you didn’t know what they were doing and not doing.
==> I did do one thing. When I learned from the noon news broadcast on Wednesday that Floyd Vance was being held without bail, and rang Lon Cohen to check it, I phoned Lily Rowan to say I wanted to see the client and was invited to lunch; and after we had finished the lobster salad and cantaloupe mousse and had gone out’ to the terrace, I told Amy that there was no more danger of her being a special target and if she went out for a walk her chances of getting back in one <==

iece were as good as anybody else’s. Naturally she wanted to know what had happened, and Lily did too, and I think that was the first and only time that Lily suspected me of putting on an act in connection with my work. She remembered that she had a date, some kind of a committee meeting, which I doubted, and left me there with Amy. I admit she thought she was being considerate, but it was no favor to me. I had been stalling Amy for two weeks and she wanted to know, and I couldn’t blame her. Usually you can tell a client something, but I had already told her that her mother’s name was Carlotta Vaughn, and there was absolutely nothing that I was ready to add. When I left I wasn’t at all sure that I was still the one man in the world she could trust.
Of course I read every word in the Wednesday and Thursday papers about the hit-and-run driver the police had nabbed after three months, but learned nothing about motive. I got the impression that the fingerprints which had identified him had been secured by extremely competent detective work by the Homicide Bureau, but there were no published details about it. There was no mention of Nero Wolfe or Archie Goodwin. There was a lot of new information, new to me, about Floyd Vance, and one item cleared up a point that I had wondered about. In 1944 he had been in his late twenties and single, and why hadn’t he been sent, either to Europe or to Asia, to help several million of his fellow citizens do some expert handling of the public image of the United States of America? According to Wednesday’s Gazette and News, and Thursday’s Times, he had been excused because he had some kind of a trick knee. Other items, though they cleared up nothing, told me more about him - for instance, that he had always been a tadpole in a big frog pond as a public-relations counselor. Evidently he had had very little effect on the dignity of man, either way.
When the phone rang at 6:38 p.m. Thursday, I was at my desk working on germination records and Wolfe was at his with a book he had just started on, an advance copy of The Future of Germany, by Karl Jaspers. I reached for the receiver.
"Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie - "
