==> He paid us a visit the day he stopped the bullet. Ben Jensen was a publisher, a politician, and in my opinion a poop. I had had a sneaking idea that he would have gone ahead and bought the inside Army dope that captain Peter Root had offered to sell him if he had been able to figure out a way of using it without any risk of losing a hunk of hide. But he had played it safe and had co-operated with Nero Wolfe like a good little boy. <==
That had been a couple of months before.
Now, early on a Tuesday morning, he phoned to say he wanted to see Wolfe. When I told him that Wolfe would be occupied with the orchids, as usual, until eleven o'clock, he fussed a little and made a date for eleven sharp. He arrived five minutes ahead of time, and I escorted him into the office and invited him to deposit his big bony frame in the red leather chair. after he sat down he asked me, "Don't I remember you? Aren't you Major Goodwin?"
"Yep."
"You're not in uniform."
"I was just noticing," I said, "that you need a haircut. At your age, with your gray hair, it looks better trimmed. More distinguished. Shall we continue with the personal remarks?"

There was the clang of Wolfe's personal elevator out in the hall, and a moment later Wolfe entered, exchanged greetings with the caller, and got himself, all of his two hundred and sixty-some pounds, lowered into his personal chair behind his desk. Ben Jensen said, "Something I wanted to show you - got it in the mail this morning," and took an envelope from his pocket and stood up to hand it across.

Wolfe glanced at the envelope, removed a piece of paper from it and glanced at that, and passed them along to me. The envelope was addressed to Ben Jensen, neatly hand-printed in ink. The piece of paper had been clipped from something, all four edges, with scissors or a sharp knife, and it had printed on it, not by hand, in large black script:
YOU ARE ABOUT TO DIE - AND I WILL WATCH YOU DIE!
Wolfe murmured, "Well, sir?"

"I can tell you," I put in, "free for nothing, where this came from." Jensen snapped at me. "You mean who sent it?"
"Oh, no. For that I would charge. It was clipped from an ad for a movie called Meeting at Dawn. The movie of the century. I saw the ad last week in the American Magazine. I suppose it's in all the magazines.

I think someone's going to try to kill me, and I don't know who or why or when or how. I suppose tracing it is out of the question, but I want some protection. I want to buy it from you."
I put up a hand to cover a yawn. I knew there would be nothing doing - no case, no fee, no excitement. In the years I had been living in Nero Wolfe's house on West Thirty-fifth Street, acting as a goad, prod, lever, irritant, and chief assistant in the detective business, I had heard him tell at least fifty scared people, of all conditions and ages, that if someone had determined to kill them and was going to be stubborn about it he would probably succeed. On occasion, when the bank balance was doing a dive, he had furnished Gather or Durkin or Panzer or Keems as a bodyguard at a hundred percent mark-up, but now they were all

 fighting Germans or Japs, and anyhow, we had just deposited a five-figure check from a certain client.

Jensen got sore, naturally, but Wolfe only murmured at him that he might succeed in interesting the police or that we would be glad to give him a list of reliable detective agencies which would provide companions for his movements as long as he remained alive - at sixty bucks for twenty-four hours. Jensen said that wasn't it, he wanted to hire Wolfe's brains.
Wolfe merely made a face and shook his head. Then Jensen wanted to know what about Goodwin? Wolfe said that Major Goodwin was an officer in the United States Army.
"He's not in uniform," Jensen growled.

That was Tuesday. The next morning, Wednesday, the papers headlined the murder of Ben Jensen on the front page. Eating breakfast in the kitchen with Fritz, as usual, I was only halfway through the report in the Times when the doorbell rang, and when I answered it.
I found on the stoop our old friend Inspector Cramer of the Homicide Squad.

Nero Wolfe said, "Not interested, not involved, and not curious."
He was a sight, as he always was when propped up in bed with his breakfast tray. The custom was for Fritz to deliver the tray to his room on the second floor at eight o'clock. It was now eight-fifteen, and already down the gullet were the peaches and cream, most of the unrationed bacon, and two-thirds of the eggs, not to mention coffee and the green tomato jam. The black silk coverlet was folded back, and you had to look to tell where the yellow percale sheet ended and the yellow pajamas began. Few people except Fritz and me ever got to see him like that, but he had stretched a point for Inspector Cramer, who knew that from nine

"In the past dozen years," Cramer said in his ordinary growl, without any particular feeling, "you have told me, I suppose, in round figures, ten million lies."
The commas were chews on his unlighted cigar. He looked the way he always did when he had been working all night - peevish and put upon but under control, all except his hair, which had forgotten where the part went.

"And I have told you what for," Wolfe said politely. "He had received that threat and said he wanted to hire my brains. I declined to work for him and he went away.
That was all."
"Why did you decline to work for him? What had he done to you?"
"Nothing." Wolfe poured coffee. "I don't do that kind of work. A man whose life is threatened anonymously is either in no danger at all, or his danger is so acute and so ubiquitous that his position is hopeless. My only previous association with Mr. Jensen was in connection with an attempt by an Army captain named Peter Root to sell him inside Army information for political purposes. Together we got the necessary evidence and Captain Root was court-martialed. Mr. Jensen was impressed, so he said, by my handling of that case. I suppose that was why he came to me when he wanted help."
"Did he think the threat came from someone connected with Captain Root?"

In the evening Doyle went along to a meeting at a midtown club. They left the dub at eleven-twenty, and apparently went straight home, on the subway or a bus, to the apartment house where Jensen lived on Seventy-third Street near Madison. It was eleven-forty-five when they were found dead on the sidewalk at the entrance to the apartment house. Both shot in the heart with a thirty-eight, Doyle from behind and Jensen from the front. We have the bullets. No powder marks. No nothing."

Wolfe murmured sarcastically, putting down his coffee cup and indicating that since I was there I might as well remove the tray, "Mr. Cornwall's best man."
"Nuts," Cramer objected to the sarcasm. "He was shot in the back. There's a narrow passage ten paces away where the guy could have hid. Or the shots could have come from a passing car, or from across the street - though that would have taken some shooting, two right in the pump. We haven't found nobody who heard the shots. The doorman was in the basement stoking the water heater, the excuse for that being that they're short of men like everybody else. The elevator man was on his way to the tenth floor within passenger, a tenant. The bodies were discovered by two women on their way home from a movie. It must have happened not more than a minute before they came by, but they had just got off a Madison Avenue bus at the corner."
Wolfe got out of bed, which was an operation deserving an audience. He glanced at the clock on the bed table. It was eight-thirty-five.

They left the dub at eleven-twenty, and apparently went straight home, on the subway or a bus, to the apartment house where Jensen lived on Seventy-third Street near Madison. It was eleven-forty-five when they were found dead on the sidewalk at the entrance to the apartment house. Both shot in the heart with a thirty-eight, Doyle from behind and Jensen from the front. We have the bullets. No powder marks. No nothing."
==> Wolfe murmured sarcastically, putting down his coffee cup and indicating that since I was there I might as well remove the tray, "Mr. Cornwall's best man." <==
"Nuts," Cramer objected to the sarcasm. "He was shot in the back. There's a narrow passage ten paces away where the guy could have hid. Or the shots could have come from a passing car, or from across the street - though that would have taken some shooting, two right in the pump. We haven't found nobody who heard the shots. The doorman was in the basement stoking the water heater, the excuse for that being that they're short of men like everybody else. The elevator man was on his way to the tenth floor within passenger, a tenant. The bodies were discovered by two women on their way home from a movie. It must have happened not more than a minute before they came by, but they had just got off a Madison Avenue bus at the corner."
Wolfe got out of bed, which was an operation deserving an audience. He glanced at the clock on the bed table. It was eight-thirty-five.
"I know, I know," Cramer growled. "You've got to get dressed and get upstairs to your goddam horticulture. The tenant going up in the elevator was a prominent doctor who barely knew Jensen by sight. The two women who found the bodies are Seventh Avenue models who never heard of Jensen. The elevator man has worked there over twenty years without displaying a grudge, and Jensen was a generous tipper and popular with the bunch. The doorman is a fat nitwit who was hired two weeks ago only because of the manpower situation and doesn't know the tenants by name. Beyond those, all we have is the population of New York city and the guests who arrive and depart daily and nightly. That's why I came to you, and for God's sake, give me what you've got. You can see I need it."

"Indeed," Wolfe said mildly. "If that was his best man ..."

So Cornwall says," Cramer insisted, "and he's dead. Name of Doyle, been in the game twenty years, with a good record. The picture as we've got it doesn't necessarily condemn him. Jensen went to Cornwall and Mayor yesterday about noon, and Cornwall assigned Doyle as a guard. We've traced all their movements - nothing special.

"Mr. Cramer." The mountain of yellow pajamas moved. "I repeat. I am not interested, not involved, and not curious." Wolfe headed for the bathroom.
Two minutes later, downstairs, as I opened the front door for Inspector Cramer's exit, he turned to me with his cigar tilted up from the corner of his mouth to about a quarter to one and observed, "One thing about that black silk bed cover, it can be used for his shroud when the time comes. Let me know, and I'll come and help sew on it."

I eyed him coldly. "You scold us when we lie, and you scold us when we tell the truth. What does the city pay you for anyhow?" back in the office there was the morning mail, which had been ignored on account of the interruption of the early visitor. I got busy with the opener. There was the usual collection of circulars, catalogues, appeals, requests for advice without enclosed check, and other items, fully up to the pre-war standard, and I was getting toward the bottom of the stack without encountering anything startling or promising when I slit another envelope and there it was.
I stared at it. I picked up the envelope and stared at that. I don't often talk to myself, but I said loud enough for me to hear, "My goodness." Then I left the rest of the mail for later and went and mounted the three flights to the plant rooms on the roof. Proceeding through the first three departments, past everything from rows of generating flasks to Cattleya hybrids covered with blooms, I found Wolfe in the potting room, with Theodore Horstmann, the orchid nurse, examining a crate of sphagnum that had just arrived.
"Well?" he demanded with no sign of friendliness.
The general idea was that when he was up there I interrupted him at my peril.

"I suppose," I said carelessly, "that I shouldn't have bothered you, but I ran across something in the mail that I thought you'd find amusing," and I put them on the bench before him, side by side: the envelope with his name and address printed on it by hand, in ink, and the piece of paper that had been clipped from something with scissors or a sharp knife, reading in large black script, printed but not by hand:
YOU ARE ABOUT TO DIE - AND I WILL WATCH YOU DIE!

"You are going to Washington?"

"When do you leave?"
"I have a seat on the six o'clock train, but I could take a later—" "Very well. Then we have the day. Your notebook."
==> Wolfe leaned forward to pour beer and drink, and then leaned back again. "I offer a comment on your jocosity.

It might have been merely the attempt of a coward to upset his digestion. We no longer enjoy that ignorance. This person not only promptly killed Mr. Jensen, with wit equal to his determination, but also killed Mr. Doyle, a stranger, whose presence could not have been foreseen. We now know that this person is cold-blooded, ruthless, quick to decide and to act, and an egomaniac." <==
"Yes, sir. I agree. If you go to bed and stay there until I get back from Washington, letting no one but Fritz enter the room, I may not be able to control my tongue when with you but actually I will understand and I won't tell anybody. You need a rest anyway. And don't lick any envelopes."
"Bah." Wolfe wiggled a finger at me. "That thing was not sent to you. Presumably you are not on the agenda."
"Yes, sir."
"And this person is dangerous and requires attention." "I agree."
"Very well." Wolfe shut his eyes. "Take notes as needed. It may be assumed, if this person means business with me as he did with Mr. Jensen, that this is connected with the case of Captain Peter Root. I had no other association whatever with Mr. Jensen - learn the whereabouts of Captain Root."

 contradiction in terms - not a good epithet. Her name is Jane Geer."

"Oh," I said offhand, "I sort of struck up an acquaintance with her. I guess I can get in touch with her. But I doubt - "
"Do so. I want to see her. Excuse me for interrupting, but you have a train to catch. Also inform Inspector Cramer of this development and suggest that he investigate captain Root's background - his relatives and intimates - anyone besides Miss Geer who might thirst for vengeance at his disgrace. I'll do that. If Captain Root is in prison, arrange with General Fife to bring him here. I want to have a talk with him. Where is the clipping received yesterday by Mr. Jensen? Ask Mr. Cornwall and Mr. Cramer. There is the possibility that this is not another one like it, but the same one."
I shook my head. "No, sir. This one is clipped closer to the printing at the upper right."
"I noticed that, but ask anyway. Inspect the chain bolts on the doors and test the night gong in your room.
Fritz will sleep in your room tonight. I shall speak to Fritz and Theodore. All of this can easily be attended to by telephone except Miss Geer, and that is your problem. Do not for the present mention her to Mr. Cramer. I want to see her before he does. When will you return from Washington?"

'I should be able to catch a noon train back - my appointment's at nine. Getting here around five." I added earnestly, "If I can clear it with Carpenter to cross the ocean, I will of course arrange not to leave until this ad-clipper has been attended to. I wouldn't want - "
"Don't hurry back on my account. Or alter your plans. You receive a salary from the government."
==> Wolfe's tone was dry, sharp, and icy, plainly intended to pierce all my vital organs at once. He went on with it, "Please get General Fife on the phone. We'll begin by learning about Captain Root." <==

The program went smoothly, all except the Jane Geer number. If it hadn't been for her I'd have been able to make the six o'clock train with hours to spare.
Fife reported back on Root in thirty minutes, to the effect that Root was in the clink on government property down in Maryland and would be transported to New York without delay for an interview with Wolfe, which appeared to contradict the saying that democracies are always ungrateful. Cornwall said he had turned the clipping and envelope Jensen had received over to Inspector Cramer, and Cramer verified it and said he had it. But Cramer seemed to be too busy for an extended phone conversation, and I understood why when, shortly after we had finished lunch, he arrived at our place in person, sat down in the red leather chair and narrowed his eyes at Wolfe, emitted a hoarse, grating chuckle and said offensively:
"Interested, involved, and curious."
Naturally Wolfe tossed it back at him, but after three minutes of fast and hot tongue work they patched it up and discussed matters. Cramer had the Jensen clipping with him, and they compared the two and found they were from copies of the same magazine, a piece of information which I would have considered no bargain at a nickel. We emptied the bag on the Captain Root episode, all but the Jane Geer item, and Cramer said he would do a survey of Root's history and connections. as for the official investigation of the Jensen murder, they still had the entire population of the metropolitan area for suspects, which gave them plenty of room to move around in. When Cramer's recital made it evident that the squad had got nowhere at all, Wolfe saw fit to make a couple of cracks and Cramer returned the compliment, so the conference ended on the same breezy note it had begun with.

On Jane Geer the luck was low. When before noon I phoned the advertising agency she worked for I was told that she was somewhere in Long Island admiring some client's product for which she was to produce copy. When I finally did get her, after four o'clock, she went willful on me, presumably because she regarded my phoning five times in one day as evidence that my primal impulses had been aroused and I was beginning to pant. She would not come to Nero Wolfe's place unless I went after her and bought her a cocktail first.
So I met her a little after five at the Calico Room at the Churchill, and bought.

It was not my opinion, at that stage of affairs, that this special item of God's second-thought bounty for man was guilty of premeditated and cold-blooded murder. because of my interest in human nature I had found occasion, in the brief period since I had first met her, to discover that she was capable of strong feelings over a wide range of territory, and that she did not believe in limiting their expression to little hints like darting the eyes. I had never seen her scratch or pull hair, but I had known her only two months or so, and unquestionably she packed the potential. However, I felt that the Jensen-Doyle massacre, one of them a perfect stranger, did not belong in her repertory; and I knew she had acquired a different slant on the Captain Root incident since the day she called Wolfe a mongrel bloodhound.

==> It was not my opinion, at that stage of affairs, that this special item of God's second-thought bounty for man was guilty of premeditated and cold-blooded murder. because of my interest in human nature I had found occasion, in the brief period since I had first met her, to discover that she was capable of strong feelings over a wide range of territory, and that she did not believe in limiting their expression to little hints like darting the eyes. I had never seen her scratch or pull hair, but I had known her only two months or so, and unquestionably she packed the potential. However, I felt that the Jensen-Doyle massacre, one of them a perfect stranger, did not belong in her repertory; and I knew she had acquired a different slant on the Captain Root incident since the day she called Wolfe a mongrel bloodhound. <==
She darted her brown eyes at me. I didn't say she never darted, I said she didn't stop there. "Let me," she said, "see your right forefinger."
I poked it at her. She rubbed its tip gently with the tip of her own. "I wondered if it had a callus. After dialing my number five times in less than five hours. are you trying to win some kind of a bet? Or did you dream about me?" She sipped her Torn Collins, bending her head to get her lips to the straw. A strand of her hair slipped forward over an eye and a cheek, and I reached across and used the same finger to put it back in place.
"I took that liberty," I told her, "because I wish to have an unobstructed view of your lovely phiz. I want to see if you turn pale or your eyes get glassy."
"Overwhelmed by you so near?"
"No, I know that reaction - I correct for it. Anyhow I doubt if I'm magnetic right now because I'm sore at you for making me miss a train."

"I didn't phone you this time. You phoned me."
==> "Okay." I drank. "You said on the phone that you still don't like Nero Wolfe and you wouldn't go to see him unless you knew what for and maybe not even then. <==
So this is what for. He wants to ask you whether you intend to kill him yourself or hire the same gang that you got to kill Jensen and Doyle. So he'll know what

 to expect."
"Mercy." She looked my face over. "You'd better put your humor on a diet. It's taking on weight."
I shook my head. "Ordinarily I would enjoy playing catch with you, as you are aware, but I can't miss all the trains. I'm not even trying to be funny, let alone succeeding. I was instructed to tell you this if necessary. because Wolfe's life has been threatened in the same manner as Jensen's was, the supposition is that Jensen was murdered for revenge, for what he did to Captain Root. Because of the cutting remarks you made when Root was trapped, and your general attitude, there is a tendency to want to know what you have been doing lately. Wolfe wants to ask you. If you wonder why I didn't start with some grade A detecting by finding out where you were last night between eleven and twelve, that wouldn't help any because what if you hired - "

"Stop." She stopped me. "I'm dreaming." "I'm not."
"It's fantastic."
"Sure. Lots of things are."
"Nero Wolfe seriously thinks I - did that? Or had it done?" "I didn't say so. He wants to discuss it with you."
Her eyes flashed. Her tone took on an edge. "It is also extremely corny. And the police? Have you kindly arranged that when Wolfe finishes with me I proceed to headquarters? Would you be good enough to phone my boss in the morning and let him know where I am? I can't begin to tell you - "

"Listen, Tiger-eyes." She let me cut her off, which was a pleasant surprise. "Have you noticed me sneaking up on you from behind? If so, draw it for me. I have explained a situation. Your name has not been mentioned to the police, though they have consulted us. You are, let us assume, as innocent as a cheeping chick, which you do not, however, resemble in visible physical aspects."
"Thank you." The edge was even sharper.

"You're welcome. But since the police are onto the Root angle they are apt to get a steer in your direction without us, and it wouldn't hurt if Wolfe had already satisfied himself that you wouldn't kill a fly."

"By what process?" She was scornful. "I suppose he asks me if I ever committed murder, and I smile and say no, and he apologizes and gives me an orchid."
"Not quite. He's a genius. He asks you questions like do you bait your own hook when you go fishing, and you reveal yourself without knowing it."
"It sounds fascinating." Her eyes suddenly changed, and the line of her lips. She had been struck with an idea. "I wonder," she said.
"What is it, and we'll both wonder."
"Sure." Her eyes had changed more. "This wouldn't by any chance be a climax you've been working up to?

You with a thousand girls and women so that you have to issue ration books so many minutes to a coupon, and yet finding so much time for me? Leading up, heaven knows why, and I don't care to go to heaven to find out, to this idiotic frame - "
"Turn that one off," I broke in, "or I'll begin to get suspicious myself. You know darned well why I have found time for you, having a mirror as you do. I have been experimenting to test my emotional reaction to form, color, touch, and various perfumes, and I have been deeply grateful for your co-operation. For you to pretend to imagine that the experiment we have been carrying on was on my part preparation for a frame-up for murder is an insult both to my intelligence and my emotional integrity."
==> "Ha, ha." She stood up, her eyes not softening nor her tone melting. "I am going to see Nero Wolfe. I welcome an opportunity to reveal myself to Nero Wolfe. Do I go or are you taking me?" <==
I took her. I paid the check and we went out and got a taxi. during the brief ride downtown and crosstown she got more realistic. She said, among other things, "I was taken in by Peter Root. I thought he was innocent and was being made the goat. So I expressed myself accordingly, and why shouldn't I? But I am over all that, as you know unless you are a two-faced subhuman Pithecanthropus, and

 this business about the murder of that Jensen, which I read about in the morning paper, is utter poppycock. I'm a working girl.

The publicity about me in the Peter Root business didn't help me any, and this would about finish me."
"Don't," I advised her, "take that line with Nero Wolfe. His attitude toward women as business executives is a little peculiar, not to mention his attitude toward women."
"I'll handle Nero Wolfe." "Hooray. No one ever has yet."

I didn't get to see her try, because she didn't get to see Wolfe. Since chain-bolt orders were in effect, my key wouldn't let us in and I had to ring the doorbell for Fritz. I had just pushed the button when who should appear, mounting the steps to join us on the stoop, but the Army officer that they use for a model when they want to do a picture conveying the impression that masculine comeliness will win the war. I admit he was handsome; I admitted it to myself right then, when I first saw him. He looked preoccupied and concentrated, but even so he found time for a glance at Jane, which was actually nothing against him, especially when you consider that she also found time for a glance at him. at that moment the door swung open and I spoke to Fritz. "Okay, thanks. Is Mr. Wolfe in the office?"
"No, he's up in his room."
"All right, I'll take it." Fritz departed, and I maneuvered into position to dominate the scene, on the doorsill facing out. I spoke to the masculine model.
"Yes, Major? This is Nero Wolfe's place."

"I know it is." He had a baritone voice that suited him to a T. "I want to see him. My name is Emil Jensen. I am the son of Ben Jensen, who was killed last night."

"Archie. Miss Geer is here. Also Major Emil Jensen just arrived. He is the son of Ben Jensen and prefers to tell you what he wants to consult you about."
"Give them both my regrets. I am engaged and can see no one." "Engaged for how long?"

So I told them that. They were not pleased. The Lord knows what kind of a performance Jane would have put on if she hadn't been restrained by the presence of a stranger; as it was, she didn't have to fumble around for pointed remarks. Jensen wasn't indignant, but he sure was stubborn. During an extended conversation that got nowhere, I noticed a gradual increase in their inclination to cast sympathetic glances at each other, which I suppose was only natural since they were both in a state of irritation at the same person for the same reason. I thought it might help matters along, meaning they might clear out sooner, if I changed the subject, so I said emphatically, "Miss Geer, this is Major Jensen."
He got to his feet, bowed to her like a man who knows how to bow, and told her, "How do you do. It looks as if it's hopeless, at least for this evening, for both of us. I'll have to hunt a taxi, and it would be a pleasure if you'll let me drop you ..."
So they left together. Going down the stoop, which I admit was moderately steep, he indicated not obtrusively that he had an arm there, and she rested her

 fingers in the bend of it to steady herself. That alone showed astonishing progress in almost no time at all, for she was by no means a born clinger.
==> Oh, well, he was a major too. I shrugged indifferently as I shut the door. Then I sought the stairs, mounted a flight to the door of Wolfe's room, knocked, and was invited to enter. <==
Standing in the doorway to his bathroom, facing me, his old-fashioned razor in his hand, all lathered up, he demanded brusquely, "What time is it?"
"Six-thirty."
"When is the next train?"
"Seven o'clock. But what the hell, apparently there is going to be work to do. I can put it off to next week."

I faded, mounted another flight to my room, got into my uniform, and tossed some things into a bag. Boy, was he carrying the banner high! My hero. I caught the train with two minutes to spare.

After the war I intend to run for Congress and put through laws about generals. I

 have a theory that generals should be rubbed liberally with neat's-foot oil before being taken out and shot. Though I doubt if I would have bothered with the oil in the case of General Carpenter that morning if I had had a free hand.
==> I was a major. So I sat and said yessir, yessir, yessir, while he told me that he had given me the appointment only because he thought I wanted to discuss something of importance, and that I would stay where I was put, and that the question of my going overseas had been decided long ago and I would shut my trap about it. I never found out whether Wolfe had phoned him or not. <==
He didn't phone Wolfe. He didn't even pat me on the head and tell me there, there, be a good soldier. He merely said, in effect, nuts. Then he observed that since I was in Washington I might as well confer with the staff on various cases, finished and unfinished, and would I report immediately to Colonel Dickey.
I doubt if I made a good impression, considering my state of mind. They kept me around, conferring, all day Thursday and most of Friday. I phoned Wolfe that I was detained. By explaining the situation on Thirty-fifth Street I could have got permission to beat it back to New York, but I wasn't going to give that collection of brass headgear an excuse to giggle around that Nero Wolfe didn't have brains enough to arrange to keep on breathing, in his own house, without me there to look after him. Besides, I knew that Carpenter would have phoned Wolfe, out of courtesy as well as concern, and Wolfe's reaction to that when I got back would be apt to displease me. but I was tempted to hop a plane when, late Thursday evening, I saw the ad in the Star. I had been too busy all day, and at dinner with a bunch of them and after, to take a look at a New York paper. I was alone in my hotel room when it caught my eye, bordered and spaced to make a spot:
WANTED A MAN weighing about 260-270, around 5 ft. 11, 45-56 years old, medium in coloring, waist not over 48, capable of easy and normal movement. Temporary. Hazardous. $100 a day. Send photo with letter. Box 292 Star.
I read it through four times, stared at it disapprovingly for an additional two minutes, and then reached for the phone and put in a New York call. It was going on midnight, but Wolfe never went to bed early. But when the connection was made, after a short wait, it wasn't his voice that I heard. It was Fritz Brenner's.
"Mr. Nero Wolfe's residence."

I sat and waited. Before long he was back on.

"The bolts and the gong and so forth?"
"Yes. With you away - "
"I'll be back tomorrow - I hope. Probably late afternoon."
==> Getting ready for bed, I tried to figure out in what manner, if I were making preparations to kill Nero Wolfe, I could make use of an assistant, hired on a temporary basis at a hundred bucks a day, who was a physical counterpart of Wolfe. The two schemes I devised weren't very satisfactory, and the one I hit on after I got my head on the pillow was even worse, so I flipped the switch on the nervous system and let the muscles quit. <==
In the morning I went to the Pentagon Building and started conferring again, but it was a lot of hooey. There wasn't anything they really needed me for, and I didn't pretend, even to be polite, that I needed them.
Still it went on. By three in the afternoon they seemed to be taking me for granted, as if I belonged there. A feeling that I was doomed began to ooze into me. The Pentagon had got me and would never turn me loose. I was on my way down its throat, and once it got me into its stomach and the machinery began to chum me and squirt dissolving juice over me, at five o'clock I called up all my reserves and told a colonel, "Looky. Don't you think, sir, I've done all I can here? Would it not be advisable for me to return to my post in New York?"
"Well." He lifted his chin to consider. "I'll ask Major Zabreskie. He will of course have to consult Colonel Shawn. It will have to go through - when did you get here?"
"Yesterday morning."
"Whom did you see first on arrival?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 28936    window = 28931 28941


"General Carpenter."
"Oh. The devil." He looked worried. "Then it will have to go to him, and he's tied up. I'll tell you what we'd better do."
He told me what we'd better do. I listened attentively, but it didn't register. Doomed was no word for it.


==> I was sunk for the duration, possibly for life. I told him there was no great rush, it could wait till morning. I would ask Major Zabreskie myself, and managed to break away from him. I got into a corridor, made it to the ground floor, used all my faculties, and succeeded in breaking through to the open air. My trained mind and years of experience as a detective got me onto the right bus. Five minutes at the hotel were enough to get my bag and pay my bill, and I shared a taxi to the airport and bought a ticket to New York. Eating could wait, but it didn't. I did. There was no room on either the six-thirty or the seven-thirty, so, with both appetite and time, I tried four kinds of sandwiches and found them all edible. Finally I got a seat on the eight-thirty plane, and when it landed at La Guardia Field an hour and a half later I began to feel safe. Surely I could elude them in the throngs of the great metropolis. Actually I was offering ten to one that by morning everybody at the Pentagon would have forgotten that I had been there. arriving at Wolfe's house on Thirty-fifth Street a little before eleven, I didn't get out my key because I knew the door would be bolted and I would need help. I gave the button three short pushes as usual, and in a moment there were footsteps, and the curtain was pulled aside, and Fritz was peering at me through the glass panel. Satisfied, he let me in and greeted me with a tone and expression indicating that he was pleased to see me. I saw Wolfe was in the office, since the door to it was open and the light shining through, so I breezed down the hall and on in. <==
"I am a fug—" I began, and stopped. Wolfe's chair behind his desk, his own chair and no one else's under any circumstances, was occupied by the appropriate mass of matter in comparatively human shape, in other words by a big fat man, but it wasn't Nero Wolfe. I had never seen him before.
V
Fritz, who had stayed to bolt the door, came at me from behind, talking. The occupant of the chair neither moved nor spoke, but merely leered at me. I would have called it a leer. I became aware that Fritz was telling me that Mr. Wolfe was up in his room.
The specimen in the chair said in a husky croak, "I suppose you're Goodwin. Archie. Have a good trip?"

I stared at him. In a way I wished I was back at the Pentagon, and in another way I wished I had come sooner.
He said, "Fritz, bring me another highball." Fritz said, "Yes, sir."

==> That was enough of that. I marched out to the hall and up a flight, went to Wolfe's door and tapped on it, and called, "Archie!" Wolfe's voice told me to come in, and I entered. He was seated in his number two chair, under the light, reading a book. He was fully dressed, and there was nothing in his appearance to indicate that he had lost his mind. <==
I did not intend to give him the satisfaction of sitting there smirking and enjoying fireworks. "Well," I said casually, "I got back. If you're sleepy we can wait till morning for conversation."
"I'm not sleepy." He closed the book with a finger inserted at his page. "Are you going to Europe?"
"You know damn well I'm not." I sat down. "We can discuss that at some future date when I'm out of the army. It's a relief to find you all alive and well around here. It's very interesting down in Washington. Everybody on their toes."
"No doubt. Did you stop in the office downstairs?"
"I did. So you put that ad in the Star yourself. How do you pay him, cash every day? Did you figure out the deductions for income tax and social security? I sat down at my desk and began to report to him. I thought it was you. Until he ordered Fritz to bring him a highball, and I know you hate highballs. Deduction.

"I did. So you put that ad in the Star yourself. How do you pay him, cash every day? Did you figure out the deductions for income tax and social security? I sat down at my desk and began to report to him. I thought it was you. Until he ordered Fritz to bring him a highball, and I know you hate highballs. Deduction. It reminds me of the time your daughter from Yugoslavia showed up and got us in a mess. Now your twin. At a century per diem it will amount to thirty-six thousand, five hundred - "
"Archie. Shut up."
"Yes, sir. Shall I go down and chat with him?"


==> Wolfe put the book down and shifted in his chair with the routine grunts. When the new equilibrium was established he said, "You will find details about him on a slip of paper in the drawer of your desk. He is a retired architect named H. H. Hackett, out of funds, and an unsurpassed nincompoop with the manners of a wart hog. I chose him, from those answering the advertisement, because his appearance and build were the most suitable and he is sufficiently an ass to be willing to risk his life for a hundred dollars a day." <==
"If he keeps on calling me Archie the risk will become - "
"If you please." Wolfe wiggled a finger at me. "Do you think the idea of him sitting there in my chair is agreeable to me? He may be dead tomorrow or the next day. I told him that. This afternoon he went to Mr. Ditson's place in a taxicab to look at orchids, and came back ostentatiously carrying two plants. Tomorrow afternoon you will drive him somewhere and bring him back, and again in the evening. Dressed for the street, wearing my hat and lightweight coat, carrying my stick, he would deceive anyone except you."
I offered a contribution, deadpan. "I know a young lady, an actress, who would do a swell job of make-up on him if - "
"Archie." His tone was sharp. "Do you think I enjoy this idiotic horseplay?"
"No, sir. But why couldn't you just stay in the house? You do anyway. I've known you to not stick your nose out for a month. And be careful who gets in.

"Until what?"
"Until the bird that killed Jensen is caught."
"Bah." He glared at me. "By whom? By Mr. Cramer? What do you suppose he is doing now? Pfui. Major Jensen, Mr. Jensen's son, arriving home on leave from Europe five days ago, learned that during his absence his father had sued his mother for divorce. The father and son quarreled, which was not unique. But Mr. Cramer has a hundred men trying to collect evidence that will convict Major Jensen of killing his father! Utterly intolerable asininity. For what motive could Major Jensen have for killing me, or threatening to?"

Well, now." My eyebrows were up. "I wouldn't just toss it in the wastebasket. What if the major figured that sending you the same kind of message he sent his father would make everybody react the way you are?"
==> Wolfe shook his head. "He didn't. Unless he's a born fool. He would have known that merely sending me that thing would be inadequate, that he would have to follow it up by making good on the threat; and he hasn't killed me and I doubt if he intends to. General Fife has looked up his record for me. Mr. Cramer is wasting his time, his men's energy, and the money of the people of New York. I am handicapped. The men I have used and can trust have gone to war. You bounce around thinking only of yourself, deserting me. I am confined to this room, left to my own devices, with a vindictive bloodthirsty maniac waiting for an opportunity to murder me. I have no hint of his identity and no sniff of his scent." <==
He sure was piling it on. But I knew better than to contribute a note of skepticism when he was in one of his romantic moods, having been fired for that once, and besides, I wouldn't have signed an affidavit that he was exaggerating the situation. So I only asked him, "What about Captain Peter Root? Did they bring him?"
"Yes. He was here today and I talked with him. He has been in that prison for over a month and asserts that this cannot possibly be connected with him or his. He says Miss Geer has not communicated with him for six weeks or more. His mother is teaching school at Danforth, Ohio; that has been verified by Mr. Cramer; she is there. His father, who formerly ran a filling station at Danforth, abandoned wife and son ten years ago, and is said to be working in a war plant in Oklahoma. Wife and son prefer not to discuss him. No brother or sister. According to Captain Root, no one on earth who would conceivably undertake a ride on the subway, let alone multiple murder, to avenge him."
"He might just possibly be right."
"Nonsense. There was no other slightest connection between Mr. Jensen and me. I've asked General Fife to keep Captain Root in New York and to request the prison authorities to look over his effects there if he has any."
"When you get an idea in your head - "

 to the point of rashness. He can probably be tempted to proceed with his program. I am aware that if you drive Mr. Hackett around, and accompany him into the car and out of it, crossing sidewalks at all hours of the day and night, you may get killed. That sort of thing was understood when I employed you and paid you. Now the government pays you. Perhaps Mr. Cramer has a man who resembles you and could be assigned to this. He would have to be a good man, alert and resourceful, for there's no point to this if an attempt on Mr. Hackett's life leaves us as empty-handed as we are now. You can give me your decision in the morning."
I'm surprised that I was able to speak at all. He had of course insulted me a million times, as I had him, but this was worse than an insult, there was no word for it. coming on top of the turndown I had got in Washington, which had reduced my buoyancy to a record low, it made me so mad that I knew I'd better get out of there. but I did not intend to let him go to bed feeling noble, so I grinned at him and controlled my voice.
"Okay," I told him. "I'll think it over. Sure, Cramer has a lot of good men. Let you know in the morning. I'll remember to turn the gong on."
I went up to my room.
==> The gong was a dingus under my bed. The custom was that when I retired at night I turned a switch, and if anyone put his foot down in the hall within ten feet of Wolfe's door the gong gonged. It had been installed on account of a certain occurrence some years previously, when Wolfe had got a knife stuck in him. The thing had never gone off except when we tested it, and in my opinion never would, but I never failed to switch it on because if Wolfe had stepped into the hall some night and the gong hadn't sounded it would have caused discussion. <==
This night, with a stranger in the house, I was glad it was there. I learned from Fritz that H. H. Hackett was sleeping in the south room, on the same floor as me, and on the basis of my brief acquaintance and my one look at him it wouldn't have surprised me if he had undertaken to sneak into Wolfe's room during the night and kill him, dispose of the body down in the furnace, and expect Fritz and me to take him for Wolfe and never catch on. Women and girls of appropriate age and configuration may call me Archie and welcome. With the rest of my fellow beings I am particular. The Hackett person would have had to know me seven years to get the privilege, and I neither desired nor intended that he should

 know me seven weeks.
In the morning, breakfast was all over the place, with Wolfe in his room, Hackett in the dining-room, and me in the kitchen with Fritz. Afterwards I spent an hour up in the plant rooms with Wolfe, on the matters we usually attended to in the office, together with consideration of the current problem. Wolfe asked if I had decided whether we should get a chauffeur for Hackett from the Homicide Squad.
I looked judicious. "I have," I told him, "thought it over from all angles. Unquestionably Cramer could give us a man who would be my superior in courage, wit, integrity, reflex time, and purity of morals. But here's the trouble— not one anything like as handsome as me. Not a chance. So I'll do it myself."

"Forget it. You're under a strain. Mr. Hackett's life is in jeopardy and it makes you nervous."
We got to details. Jane Geer was making a nuisance of herself. I understood now, of course, why Wolfe had refused to see her Wednesday evening. After sending me to get her he had conceived the strategy of hiring a double, and he didn't want her to get a look at the real Nero Wolfe because if she did she would be less likely to be deceived by the counterfeit and go to work on him. That meant she was seriously on his list, but I didn't take the trouble to inform him that in my opinion he could cross her off, since he would only have grunted.
She had phoned several times, insisting on seeing him, and had come to the house Friday morning and argued for five minutes with Fritz through the three- inch crack which the chain bolt permitted the door to open to. Now Wolfe had an idea for one of his elaborate charades. I was to phone her to come to see Wolfe at six o'clock that afternoon. When she came I was to take her in to Hackett. Wolfe would coach Hackett for the interview.

"I admit it is unlikely. Also, it will convince her that Mr. Hackett' is me." "Which still will not shorten his life or lengthen yours."

Nero Wolfe about it; and the major, wishing his father's murderer to be caught and punished, had wanted to talk with Wolfe. It was Wolfe's veto of my suggestion that Major Jensen be invited to call, not on Hackett but on Wolfe himself, that showed me the state he was in.
Ordinarily it would have needed no suggestion from me, since the major, in his present situation, was a natural for a fat fee.
When I got down to the office Hackett was there in Wolfe's chair, eating cookies and getting crumbs on the desk. I had told him good morning previously, and having nothing else to tell him, ignored him. From the phone on my desk I got Jane Geer at her office.
"Archie," I told her.
She snapped, "Archie who?"

He be told Cramer that he had come to see Wolfe on Wednesday because on Tuesday morning his father had shown him the threat he had received in the mail and had announced that he was going to consult
Nero Wolfe about it; and the major, wishing his father's murderer to be caught and punished, had wanted to talk with Wolfe. It was Wolfe's veto of my suggestion that Major Jensen be invited to call, not on Hackett but on Wolfe himself, that showed me the state he was in.
Ordinarily it would have needed no suggestion from me, since the major, in his present situation, was a natural for a fat fee.
==> When I got down to the office Hackett was there in Wolfe's chair, eating cookies and getting crumbs on the desk. I had told him good morning previously, and having nothing else to tell him, ignored him. From the phone on my desk I got Jane Geer at her office. <==
"Archie," I told her.
She snapped, "Archie who?"
"Oh, come, come. We haven't sicked the police onto you, have we? Let's gossip a while."
"I am ringing off."

She snapped, "Archie who?"
"Oh, come, come. We haven't sicked the police onto you, have we? Let's gossip a while."
"I am ringing off."


==> "Then I am too. In a moment. Nero Wolfe wants to see you." "He does? Ha, ha. He doesn't act like it." <==
"He has reformed. I showed him a lock of your hair. I showed him a picture of Elsa Maxwell and told him it was you. This time he won't let me come after you."
"Neither will I."
"Okay. Be here at six o'clock and you will be received. Six o'clock today, p.m. Will you?"
She admitted that she would. I made a couple of other calls and did some miscellaneous chores. But I found that my jaw was getting clamped tighter and tighter on account of an irritating noise. Finally I spoke to the occupant of Wolfe's chair. "What kind of cookies are those?"
"Ginger snaps." Evidently the husky croak was his normal voice. "I didn't know we had any."

"We didn't. I asked Fritz. He doesn't seem to know about ginger snaps, so I walked over to Ninth Avenue and got some."
"When? This morning?" "Just a little while ago."
I turned to my phone, buzzed the plant rooms, got Wolfe, and told him, "Mr. Hackett is sitting in your chair eating ginger snaps. Just a little while ago he walked to Ninth Avenue and bought them. If he pops in and out of the house whenever he sees fit, what are we getting for our hundred bucks?"
Wolfe spoke to the point. I hung up and turned to Hackett and spoke to the point. He was not to leave the house except as instructed by Wolfe or me. He seemed unimpressed and unconcerned, but nodded good-naturedly.

"All right," he said, "if that's the bargain I'll keep it. but there's two sides to a bargain. I was to be paid daily in advance, and I haven't been paid for today. A hundred dollars net."


Wolfe had told me the same, so I took five twenties from the expense wallet and forked it over.

"I must say," he commented, folding the bills neatly and stuffing them in his waistband pocket, "this is a large return for a small effort.

"Yeah," I told him, "me too." I opened the drawer of my desk, the middle one on the right, where I kept armament, got out the shoulder holster and put it on, and selected the gun that was my property - the other two belonged to Wolfe. There were only three cartridges in it, so I pulled the drawer open farther to get to the ammunition compartment and filled the cylinder. as I shoved the gun into the holster I happened to glance at Hackett and saw that he had a new face. The line of his lips was tight, and his eyes looked startled, wary, and concentrated.
"It hadn't occurred to me before," he said, and his voice had changed too. "This Mr. Wolfe is quite an article, and you're his man. I am doing this with the understanding that someone may mistake me for Mr. Wolfe and try to kill me, but I have only his word for it that that is actually the situation. If it's more complicated than that, and the intention is for you to shoot me yourself, I want to say emphatically that that would not be fair."
I grinned at him sympathetically, trying to make up for my blunder, realizing that I should not have dressed for the occasion in his presence. The sight of the gun, a real gun and real cartridges, had scared him stiff. If he ran out on us now and we had to advertise again to find a new one - my God, I had just handed him a hundred bucks!
"Listen," I told him earnestly, "you said a minute ago that you expect nothing to happen. You may be right. I'm inclined to agree with you. But in case somebody does undertake to perform, I am wearing this little number" - I patted under my arm where the gun was - "for two purposes: first, to keep you from getting hurt; and second, if you do get hurt, to hurt him worse."

==>  Wolfe's room at eleven-thirty for instructions, which would include our afternoon outing. <==
To tell the truth, by the time the afternoon was over and I had him back in the house again, a little after five-thirty, I had to maintain a firm hold on such details as ginger snaps and his calling me Archie to keep from admiring him. During that extended expedition we made stops at Brooks Brothers, Rusterman's, the Churchill, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Botanical Gardens, and three or four others. He occupied the rear seat, of course, because Wolfe always did, and the mirror showed me that he sat back comfortably, taking in the sights, a lot more imperturbable than Wolfe himself would have been, since Wolfe disliked motion, detested bumps, and had a settled notion that all the other cars had turned out for the express purpose of colliding with his.
When we made one of our stops and Hackett got out to cross the sidewalk, he was okay. He didn't hurry or dodge or jerk or weave, but just walked. In Wolfe's hat and coat and stick, he might even have fooled me. I had to hand it to him, in spite of the fact that the whole show struck me as the biggest bust Wolfe had ever concocted. at night it might be different, but here in broad daylight, and with no discernible evidence that anyone was on our trail, I felt foolish, futile, and fatuous, and still I had to keep alert, covering all directions, with the gun in my hand resting on the seat.
Nothing happened. Not a damn thing. back at the house, I left Hackett in the office and went to the kitchen, where Wolfe was sitting at the big table drinking beer and watching Fritz make tomato juice. His daily routine was of course all shot.
I reported, "They tried to get him from the top of the Palisades with a howitzer, but missed him. He has a little bruise on his left elbow from the revolving door at
Rusterman's, but otherwise unhurt." Wolfe grunted. "How did he behave?" "Okay."

Major Emil Jensen was there with her.

He occupied the rear seat, of course, because Wolfe always did, and the mirror showed me that he sat back comfortably, taking in the sights, a lot more imperturbable than Wolfe himself would have been, since Wolfe disliked motion, detested bumps, and had a settled notion that all the other cars had turned out for the express purpose of colliding with his.
When we made one of our stops and Hackett got out to cross the sidewalk, he was okay. He didn't hurry or dodge or jerk or weave, but just walked. In Wolfe's hat and coat and stick, he might even have fooled me. I had to hand it to him, in spite of the fact that the whole show struck me as the biggest bust Wolfe had ever concocted. at night it might be different, but here in broad daylight, and with no discernible evidence that anyone was on our trail, I felt foolish, futile, and fatuous, and still I had to keep alert, covering all directions, with the gun in my hand resting on the seat.
Nothing happened. Not a damn thing. back at the house, I left Hackett in the office and went to the kitchen, where Wolfe was sitting at the big table drinking beer and watching Fritz make tomato juice. His daily routine was of course all shot.
I reported, "They tried to get him from the top of the Palisades with a howitzer, but missed him. He has a little bruise on his left elbow from the revolving door at
Rusterman's, but otherwise unhurt." Wolfe grunted. "How did he behave?" "Okay."
==> Wolfe grunted again. "After dark we may more reasonably expect results. I repeat what I told you at noon: you will take an active part in the interview with <==

 Miss Geer, but you will restrain yourself. If you permit yourself to get fanciful, there is no telling what the effect may be on Mr. Hackett. As you know, his instructions are precise, but his discipline is questionable. See that she speaks up, so I can hear her. Seat her at the corner of my desk farthest from you so I will have a good view of her. The view through that hole is restricted."
"Yes, sir." but as it turned out, I wasn't able to obey orders. It was then nearly six o'clock. When the doorbell rang a few minutes later and I went to answer it, glancing in at the office on my way down the hall to make sure that Hackett didn't have his feet up on the desk, I opened the door to find that Miss Geer hadn't ventured alone on the streets of the great city after all. Major Emil Jensen was there with her.
VI
I had the door open. It wouldn't have been courteous to slam it shut again and leave them on the stoop while I considered matters, so I dallied on the doorsill.

I had the door open. It wouldn't have been courteous to slam it shut again and leave them on the stoop while I considered matters, so I dallied on the doorsill.
"Well," I said brightly, "two on one hook?"
Jensen said hello. Jane said, "You couldn't have had that thought up, because Major Jensen decided to come on the spur of the moment. We were having cocktails."
==> She looked me up and down; it was true that I was sort of blocking the way and not moving. "May we come in?" certainly I could have told Jensen we only had one extra chair so he had better go for a walk, but if there was going to be anything accomplished by having either of those two get the idea that Hackett was Nero Wolfe, I would have picked him for the experiment rather than her. On the other hand, with Hackett primed only for her it would have been crowding our luck to confront him with both of them; and anyway, I couldn't take such a chance on my own hook. I needed advice from headquarters. So I decided to herd them into the front room, and ask them to wait, and go to consult Wolfe. <==
"Sure," I said hospitably, "enter." I gave them gangway, and when they were in, shut the door and opened the door to the front room. "In there, please. Find seats. If you don't mind waiting a minute - "

had got myself headed back for the hall before noticing an unfortunate fact: the door from the front room to the office was standing open. That was careless of me, but I hadn't expected complications. If they moved across, as they naturally would, Hackett sitting in the office would be in plain sight. But what the hell, that was what he was there for. So I kept going, down the hall to the turn into the alcove at the far end, found Wolfe there ready to take position at the peep-hole, and muttered to him:
"She brought an outrider along. Major Jensen. I put them in the front room. The door into the office is open.
Well?"

He scowled at me. He whispered, "Confound it. Return to the front room by way of the office, closing that door as you go. Tell Major Jensen to wait, that I wish to speak with Miss Geer privately. Take her to the office by way of the hall, and when you - "
Somebody fired a gun. at least that's what it sounded like, and the sound didn't come from outdoors. The walls and the air vibrated.
Judging by the noise, I might have fired it myself, but I hadn't. I moved. In three jumps I was at the door to the office. Hackett was sitting there, looking startled and speechless. I dashed through to the front room. Jensen and Jane were there, on their feet, she off to the right and he to the left, both also startled and speechless, staring at each other. Their hands were empty, except for Jane's bag. I might have been inclined to let it go for Hackett biting a ginger snap if it hadn't been for the smell. I knew that smell.

"Let me see that one in your hand," Jensen demanded.
I looked at my hand and was surprised to see a gun in it. I must have snatched it from the holster automatically en route. "Not it," I said. I poked the muzzle to within an inch of Jensen's nose. "Was it?"
He sniffed. "No." He felt the barrel, found it cold, and shook his head.
I said, "But a gun was fired inside here. Do you smell it?"
"Certainly I smell it."
==> "Okay. Let's join Mr. Wolfe and discuss it. Through there." I indicated the door to the office with a flourish of the gun. <==
Jane started jabbering, but I paid no attention. She was merely jabbering, something indignant about a put-up job and so on. She was disinclined to enter the office, but when Jensen went she followed him and I brought up the rear.
"This is Mr. Nero Wolfe," I said. "Sit down." I was using my best judgment and figured I was playing it right because Wolfe was nowhere in sight. I had to decide what to do with them while I found the gun and maybe the bullet. Jane was still trying to jabber, but she stopped when Jensen blurted, "Wolfe has blood on his head!"
I stared at Hackett. He was standing up behind the desk, leaning forward with his hand resting on the desk, looking the three of us over with an expression that left it open whether he was dazed, scared, or angry, or all three. He didn't seem to hear Jensen's words. When I did I saw the blood on Hackett's left ear and dribbling down the side of his neck.
I took in a breath and yelled, "Fritz!"
He appeared instantly, probably having been standing by in the hall by Wolfe's direction. I told him to come here, and when he came handed him my gun. "If anybody reaches for a handkerchief, shoot."

He's all right."
"I would like you to search me." Jensen stuck his hands toward the ceiling.
"That," I said, " is more like it," and crossed to him and explored him from neck to ankles, invited him to relax in a chair, and turned to Jane. She darted me a look of pure and lofty disgust and backed away as from a noxious miasma.

I remarked, "If you refuse to stand inspection and then you happen to make a gesture and Fritz shoots you in the tummy, don't blame me."
==> She darted more looks, but took it. I felt her over not quite as comprehensively as I had Jensen, took her bag and glanced in it and returned it to her, and then stepped around Wolfe's desk to examine Hackett's blood. He wasn't screaming or moaning, but the expression on his face was something. After Jensen had announced the blood, he had put his hand up to feel, and he was staring at the red on his fingers with his big jaw hanging open. <==
"My head?" he croaked. "Is it my head?"
The exhibition he was making of himself was no help to Nero Wolfe's reputation for intrepidity. After a brief look I told him distinctly, "No, sir. Nothing but a nick in the upper outside corner of your ear." I wiped with my handkerchief. "You might go to the bathroom and use a towel."
"I am not - hurt?"
I could have murdered him. Instead, I told Fritz, standing there with my gun, that unnecessary movements were still forbidden, and took Hackett to the bathroom in the far corner and shut the door behind me.
While I showed him the ear in the mirror and dabbed on some iodine and taped on a bandage, I told him to stay in there until his nerves calmed down and then rejoin us, act detached and superior, and let me do the talking.

The head-rest was upholstered in brown leather; and about eight inches from the top and a foot from the side edge, a spot that would naturally have been on a line behind Hackett's left ear as he sat, there was a hole in the leather.

 behind, and there was another hole on the rear side. I looked at the wall back of the chair and found still another hole, torn into the plaster. From the bottom draw of my desk I got a screwdriver and hammer, started chiseling, ran against a stud, and went to work with the point of my knife. When I finally turned around I held a small object between my thumb and finger. As I did so Hackett emerged from the bathroom, apparently more composed.
"Bullet," I said informatively. "Thirty-eight. Passed through Mr. Wolfe's ear and the back of his chair and ruined the wall. Patched plaster is an eyesore."
Jane sputtered. Jensen sat and gazed at me with narrowed eyes. Hackett said, in what he probably thought was a detached and superior tone, "I'll search them again." I tried not to glare at him.
"No, sir," I said deferentially, "I made sure of that. but I suggest - " "It could be," Jensen put in, "that Wolfe fired that bullet himself."

Hackett stood still, with his lips compressed and his eyes straight ahead. Jensen gave me back the glass and returned to his seat.

"Excuse me, sir. The bullet helps, but the gun would help still more. Let's be objective too. We might possibly find the object in the front room." I moved, touching his elbow to take him along. "Fritz, see that they stay put."
"I," said Jensen, getting up, "would like to be present - "
"The hell you would." I wheeled to him. My voice may have gone up a notch. "Sit down, brother. I am trying not to fly off the handle. I am trying not to be rude. Whose house is this, with bullets zipping around? I swear to God Fritz will shoot you in the knee."
He had another remark to contribute, and so did Jane, but I disregarded them and wrangled Hackett ahead of me into the front room and shut the soundproof door. Hackett began to talk, but I shut him off. He insisted he had something to say. I told him to spill it.
"It seems incredible," he asserted, meeting my eye and choosing his words, "that one of them could have shot at me from in here, through the open door, without me seeing anything."
==> "You said that before, in the bathroom. You also said you didn't remember whether your eyes were open or shut, or where you were looking, when you heard that shot." I moved my face to within fourteen inches of his. "See here. If you are suspecting that I shot at you, or that Wolfe did, you have got fleas or other insects playing tag in your brain and should have it attended to. <==
One thing alone: the way the bullet went, straight past your ear and into the chair back, it had to come from in front, the general direction of that door and this room.
It couldn't have come from the door in the hall or anywhere else, because we haven't got a gun that shoots a curve. I can't help it if your eyes were focused somewhere else or were closed or you went temporarily blind. You will please sit in that chair against the wall and not move or talk."
He grumbled but obeyed. I surveyed the field. On the assumption that the gun

 had been fired in that room, I adopted the theory that either it was still there or it had been transported or propelled without. As for transportation, I had got there not more than five seconds after the shot and found them there staring at each other. As for propulsion, the windows were closed and the Venetian blinds down. I preferred the first alternative and began to search.

As for transportation, I had got there not more than five seconds after the shot and found them there staring at each other. As for propulsion, the windows were closed and the Venetian blinds down. I preferred the first alternative and began to search.
Obviously it couldn't be anything abstruse, since five seconds wasn't long enough to pry up a floor board or make a hole in a table leg, so I tried easier places, like under furniture and behind cushions. It might be thought that under the circumstances I would have been dead sure of finding it, but I had the curious feeling that I probably wouldn't no matter how thoroughly
I looked; I have never understood why. If it was a hunch it was a bad day for hunches, because when I came to the big vase on the table between the windows and peeked into it and saw something white and stuck my hand in, I felt the gun. Getting it by the trigger guard, I lifted it out. Judging by smell, it had been fired recently, but of course it had had time to cool off. It was an old Granville thirty- eight, next door to rusty. The white object I had seen was an ordinary cotton handkerchief, man's size, with a tear in it through which the butt of the gun protruded. With proper care about touching, I opened the cylinder and found there were five loaded cartridges and one shell.
Hackett was there beside me, trying to say things. I got brusque with him.
==> "Yes, it's a gun, recently fired, and not mine or Wolfe's. Is it yours? No? Good. Okay, keep your shirt on. We're going back in there, and there will be sufficient employment for my brain without interference from you. Do not try to help me. See how long you can go without speaking a word. Just look wise as if you knew it all. If this ends as it ought to, you'll get an extra hundred. Agreed?" <==
I'll be damned if he didn't say, "Two hundred. I was shot at. I came within an inch of getting killed."
I told him he'd have to talk the second hundred out of Wolfe and opened the door to the office and followed him through. He detoured around Jane Geer and went and sat in the chair he had just escaped being a corpse in. I swiveled my own chair to face it out and sat down too.
Jensen demanded sharply, "What have you got there?"

This," I said cheerfully, "is a veteran revolver, a Granville thirty-eight, which has been fired not too long ago." I lowered it gently onto my desk. "Fritz, give me back my gun." He brought it. I kept it in my hand.

"Thank you. I found this other affair in the vase on the table in there, dressed in a handkerchief. Five unused cartridges and one used. It's a stranger here. Never saw it before. It appears to put the finishing touch on a critical situation."
Jane exploded. She cabled me an unspeakable rat. She said she wanted a lawyer and intended to go to one immediately. She called Hackett three or four things. She said it was the dirtiest frame-up in history. "Now," she told Hackett, "I know damned well you framed Peter Root. I let that skunk Goodwin talk me out of it!"

She was out of her chair, spitting fire. It was spectacular. "You won't get away with it this time! You incredible louse!"
Hackett was trying to talk back to her, making his voice louder and louder, and when she stopped for breath he could be heard.
==> "... will not tolerate it;! You come here and try to kill me! You nearly do kill me! Then you abuse me about a Peter Root and I have never heard of Peter Root!" He was putting real feeling into it; apparently he had either forgotten that he was supposed to be Nero Wolfe, or had got the notion, in all the excitement, that he really was Nero Wolfe. He was proceeding, "Young lady, listen to me! I will not -" <==
She turned and made for the door. I was immediately on my feet and after her, but halfway across the room I put on the brake, because the doorway had suddenly filled up with a self-propelled massive substance and she couldn't get through.

"Take another chair, sir, if you please?"

"Take another chair, sir, if you please?"
Hackett sidled out, without a word, and went to the red leather chair. Wolfe leaned over to peer at the hole in the back of his own chair, and then at the hole in the plaster, which I had chiseled to a diameter of four inches, grunted, and got himself seated.
"This," Jensen said, "makes it a farce."
Jane snapped, "I'm going," and headed for the door, but I had been expecting that and with only two steps had her by the arm with a good grip and was prepared to give her the twist if she went thorny on me. Jensen sprang to his feet, with both of his hands fists. Evidently in the brief space of forty-eight hours it had developed to the point where the sight of another man laying hands on his Jane started his adrenaline spurting in torrents. If he had come close enough to make it necessary to slap him with my free hand he might have got blood on his ear too, because I had my gun in that hand.
"Stop it!" Wolfe's voice was a whip. It turned us into a group of statuary. "Miss Geer, you may leave shortly, if you still want to, after I have said something. Mr. Jensen, sit down. Mr. Goodwin has a gun and is probably in a temper, and might hurt you. Archie, go to your desk, but be ready to use the gun. One of them is a murderer."

He shook his head. "No, Miss Geer. It is no great distinction not to be a coward, but I can claim it. Not cowardice. Conceit. I am insufferably conceited.

They both started talking at once, with vehemence.

"If you please! In a moment I shall offer you an alternative: the police or me. Meanwhile Mr. Cramer can help.

"I think I'll stay here," Hackett declared. "I'm a little interested in this myself, since I nearly got killed."
"Cramer on," I told Wolfe.
He lifted his phone from the cradle. "How do you do, sir. No. No, I have a request to make. If you send a man here right away, I'll give him a revolver and a bullet. First, examine the revolver for fingerprints and send me copies. Second, trace the revolver if possible. Third, fire a bullet from it and compare it both with the bullet

Jensen demanded, "What the devil is it doing there?"
Wolfe's eyes went shut. He was, of course, tasting Jensen's expression, tone of voice, and mental longitude and latitude, to try to decide whether innocent curiosity was indicated or a camouflage for guilt. He always shut his eyes when he tasted. In a moment they opened again halfway.

"You asked me to stay while you said something," Jane snapped. She and Jensen were back in their chairs. "You haven't said anything yet. Where were you when the shot was fired?"
"Pfui." Wolfe sighed. "Fritz, pack the gun and bullet in a carton, carefully with tissue paper, and give it to the man when he comes. First bring me beer. Do any of you want beer?"

His eyes went to Jensen and back to Jane. "One of you two people is apt to make a mistake, and I want to prevent it if possible. I have not yet asked you where you were and what you were doing at the instant the shot was fired. Before I do so I want to say this, that even with the information at hand it is demonstrable

 that the shot came from the direction of that door to the front room, which was standing open. Mr. Hackett could not have fired it; you, Mr. Jensen, satisfied yourself of that. Mr. Brenner was in the kitchen. Mr. Goodwin and I were together. I warn you - one of you - that this is sufficiently provable to satisfy a jury in a murder trial. Now what if you both assert that at the instant you heard the shot you were together, close together perhaps, looking at each other? For the one who fired the gun that would be a blessing indeed. For the other it might be disastrous in the end; for when the truth is disclosed, as it will be, the question of complicity will arise. How long have you two known each other?"

"Very well. Miss Geer. To assume, or pretend to assume some elaborate hocus- pocus by the inmates of this house is inane. At the moment the shot was fired I was standing near the kitchen talking with Mr. Goodwin. Since then I have been at a spot from which part of this room can be seen and voices heard."
His eyes went to Jensen and back to Jane. "One of you two people is apt to make a mistake, and I want to prevent it if possible. I have not yet asked you where you were and what you were doing at the instant the shot was fired. Before I do so I want to say this, that even with the information at hand it is demonstrable

 that the shot came from the direction of that door to the front room, which was standing open. Mr. Hackett could not have fired it; you, Mr. Jensen, satisfied yourself of that. Mr. Brenner was in the kitchen. Mr. Goodwin and I were together. I warn you - one of you - that this is sufficiently provable to satisfy a jury in a murder trial. Now what if you both assert that at the instant you heard the shot you were together, close together perhaps, looking at each other? For the one who fired the gun that would be a blessing indeed. For the other it might be disastrous in the end; for when the truth is disclosed, as it will be, the question of complicity will arise. How long have you two known each other?"
He knew; I had told him. But apparently they had both forgotten, for neither answered.
==> "Well?" Wolfe was crisp. "Miss Geer, how long have you been acquainted with Mr. Jensen. I don't suppose it's a secret?" <==
Jane's teeth were holding her lower lip. She removed them. "I met him day before yesterday. Here."
"Indeed. Is that correct, Mr. Jensen?" "Yes."
Wolfe's brows were up. "Hardly long enough to form an attachment to warrant any of the more costly forms of sacrifice. Unless the spark was exceptionally hot, not long enough to weld you into collusion for murder. I hope you understand, Miss Geer, that all that is wanted here is the truth. Where were you and what were you doing when you heard the shot?"
"I was standing by the piano. I had put my bag on the piano and was opening it." "Which way were you facing?"
"Toward the window."

"I still say," Jensen still said, "that it's a damned farce."
"Even so, sir, you're one of the cast. Surely it is risking little to tell me where - "
"I was in the doorway to the hall, looking down the hall and wondering where Goodwin had gone to. For no particular reason. I was not at that precise moment looking at Miss Geer. But I regard it as - "

==> "That won't help me any. How you regard it. And I doubt if it will help you." Wolfe poured beer, which Fritz had brought. "Now we are ready to decide something." <==
He took them both in. "Miss Geer, you said you wanted to go to a lawyer, heaven protect you. But it would not be sensible to permit either of you to walk out of here, to move and act at your own will and discretion. Since that bullet was intended for me, I reject the notion utterly. On the other hand, we can't proceed intelligently until I get a report from Mr. Cramer. There is time to be passed. You can - "
Jane got up. "I'm going."
"One moment. You can either pass it here, in company with Mr. Goodwin and his gun, or I can phone Mr. Cramer, giving him an outline of the situation, and he can send men to get you. Which do you prefer?"
Jane was doing slow motion toward the door. She didn't exactly take a step; it was more as if something was pulling her that way without her doing anything about it. I called to her without leaving my chair, "Listen, honey, I wouldn't shoot you for a nickel, but I can easy catch you before you get out the front door and this time I'll wrap you up good."
She flung it at me: "Rat!"

Wolfe returned his gaze. "I should think," he said dryly, "that you would rather stay here. As you probably know, Mr. Cramer is not fond of you, and he is somewhat heavy-handed. Not that he can be kept out of it indefinitely, but the

 immediate question is where do you want to wait for the report on the gun and bullets, here or at police headquarters? It is likely to be several hours.

Yes, it got tiresome, lasting as it did a full two hours. at first I got some diversion out of the fact that Jane and Jensen showed no inclination to sit side by side on the sofa and hold hands. God knows where Wolfe had ever found that sofa and the velvet cushions; it had been there when I had first arrived. One or the other of them did sit on it now and again during their restless moving around, but not the two together. Wolfe's poison had done its work. It was interesting to watch it.

Naturally I watched for something, any kind of sign, from which I could get a notion who was the one and who was the other, but now I leaned one way and now the other, and got nowhere. at seven-thirty we were all invited to the dining- room, but they wouldn't go. When Fritz brought trays in to us I had no trouble dealing with my share of melon, broiled pork loin wafers, salad with Wolfe's own dressing, blueberry pie, and coffee, and Jensen was with me nose and nose, but Jane wouldn't even look at hers.
I was, I admit, in no condition to place a bet, even to risk as much as a busted shoestring. The only way I could have solved the problem would have been to blindfold myself and whichever one I touched first was it. Anyway, I was licked before I started, because bold and daring, which were words Wolfe had used, was putting it mildly. He or she had of course arrived at the house with the gun ready, dressed in the handkerchief, in pocket or handbag, but only with the idea of using it if opportunity offered, for it couldn't possibly have been planned just as it happened. For split-second decision and action I had never seen anything to equal it. Entered the room. Saw, through the open door, Wolfe (supposedly) seated at his desk. Got hand on gun, protected by handkerchief. Waited. Instant came, in about a minute, when Wolfe's eyes were closed or he was looking elsewhere, and also, simultaneously, the other one was either looking in the hall or was at the piano with back turned, depending on who was who. Aimed and fired. When the other one glanced in all directions, that provided the chance to put the gun in the vase.

2. "There's a door to that bathroom from this room too. Over there. The one from the bathroom to the office is now locked."
3. "I beg your pardon." That was for a yawn.

 remember any two hours in my experience with a lower score on joviality. So I appreciated the break in the monotony when, a little before nine, I heard the doorbell. Since the door from the front room to the hall was also soundproof, that was all I got out of it except for the faint vibration of footsteps and an even fainter sound of voices. But in about three minutes the door to the hall opened and Fritz came in. He shut the door behind him and spoke, not very loud.

He held out his hand for the gun. I gave it to him and went.
If the situation in the front room had been unjovial, the one in the office was absolutely grim. One glance at Wolfe was enough to see that he was in a state of uncontrollable fury, because his forefinger was making the same circle, over and over, on the surface of his desk. Sergeant Purley Stebbins was standing by the wall, looking official. Inspector Cramer was in the red leather chair, with his face about the color of the chair.
Nobody bothered to glance at me. Wolfe snapped, "Your notebook."
I crossed to my desk and got book and pencil and sat down. "This," I observed, "is what comes of my not attending to the doorbell. If we didn't want company - "
"Pfui." Wolfe tapped a piece of paper on his desk. "Look at this."

 remember any two hours in my experience with a lower score on joviality. So I appreciated the break in the monotony when, a little before nine, I heard the doorbell. Since the door from the front room to the hall was also soundproof, that was all I got out of it except for the faint vibration of footsteps and an even fainter sound of voices. But in about three minutes the door to the hall opened and Fritz came in. He shut the door behind him and spoke, not very loud.
"Archie, Mr. Wolfe wants you in the office. Inspector Cramer is there with Sergeant Stebbins. I am to stay here."
He held out his hand for the gun. I gave it to him and went.
If the situation in the front room had been unjovial, the one in the office was absolutely grim. One glance at Wolfe was enough to see that he was in a state of uncontrollable fury, because his forefinger was making the same circle, over and over, on the surface of his desk. Sergeant Purley Stebbins was standing by the wall, looking official. Inspector Cramer was in the red leather chair, with his face about the color of the chair.
==> Nobody bothered to glance at me. Wolfe snapped, "Your notebook." <==
I crossed to my desk and got book and pencil and sat down. "This," I observed, "is what comes of my not attending to the doorbell. If we didn't want company - "
"Pfui." Wolfe tapped a piece of paper on his desk. "Look at this."
I arose and looked. It was a search warrant. "The premises ... owned and inhabited by said Nero Wolfe ... situate ..."
Wowie. I was surprised that Cramer was still alive, or Wolfe either. Cramer growled, holding himself in, "I'll try to forget what you just said, Wolfe. It was totally uncalled for. Goddam it, you have given me a runaround too many times. There I was, with that gun. A bullet fired from it matched the bullet you sent me and also the two that killed Jensen and Doyle. That's the gun, and you sent it to me. All right, then you've got a client, and when you've got a client you keep

 him right in your pocket. I would have been a goddam fool to come here and start begging you. I've begged you before."
Wolfe had started making the circle again. "I repeat, sir," he murmured, "that your acceptance of your salary constitutes a fraud on the people of New York and you are a disgrace to an honorable profession."

Cramer’s face had reached the red of the chair and was going on from there. "Then," he said, "I won't try to forget it. We're going to search this house." He started to leave the chair.

"Bah." Wolfe was disgusted. "Next you'll be warning me formally that obstruction of justice is a crime. I didn't say that the murderer wouldn't be caught, I said you wouldn't catch him. Because I already have."
A grunt came from Purley Stebbins, but no one noticed it but me. I grinned at him. Cramer said, "The hell you have."
"Yes, sir. Your report on the gun and bullets settles it. But I confess the matter is a little complicated, and I do give you a formal warning: you are not equipped to handle it. I am." Wolfe shoved the warrant across the desk. "Tear that thing up."

"No, sir." Wolfe was murmuring again. "I will not submit to duress. I would even prefer to deal with district Attorney Skinner. Tear it up, or proceed to execute it."
That was a dirty threat. Cramer's opinion of Skinner was one of the defects of our democratic system of government. Cramer looked at the warrant, at Wolfe, at me, and back at the warrant. Then he picked it up and tore. I reached for the pieces and dropped them in the wastebasket.

I winked at Purley, but he pretended not to see it. He had his notebook too, but hadn't put anything in it yet.

Cramer frowned at him. "You didn't say anything about granting. You said that you had caught the murderer."

Wolfe finished. Cramer sat scowling. Wolfe purred, "Well, sir, there's the problem. I doubt if it can be solved with what we have, or what is available on the premises. You'll have to get your men started on the indicated lines. Ill be available for consultation."
"I wish," Cramer growled, gazing at him as if he were looking at a puzzle he had seen and worked at many times but had never got solved, "I wish I knew how much dressing you put on that."

"Please don't interrupt," Wolfe snapped. "I'm telling you what happened."
==> He did so. I have a high opinion of myself as a reporter of a series of events, but, listening to Wolfe as an expert, I had to admit I couldn't have done much better. He didn't waste any words, but he got it all in. Purley nearly bit the end of his <==

 tongue off, trying to get it all in his notebook, but I didn't bother.
Wolfe finished. Cramer sat scowling. Wolfe purred, "Well, sir, there's the problem. I doubt if it can be solved with what we have, or what is available on the premises. You'll have to get your men started on the indicated lines. Ill be available for consultation."
"I wish," Cramer growled, gazing at him as if he were looking at a puzzle he had seen and worked at many times but had never got solved, "I wish I knew how much dressing you put on that."
"Not any. I have only one concern in this. I have no client. I withheld nothing and added nothing."

"Maybe." Cramer straightened up like a man of action. "Okay, we'll proceed on that basis and find out. First of all, I want to ask them some questions."
"I suppose you do." Wolfe detested sitting and listening to someone else ask questions, especially in his own office. "And Miss Geer is going to be difficult. She wants a lawyer. You are handicapped, of course, by your official status. Which one do you want first?"
Cramer stood up. "I've got to see that room before I talk to either of them. I want to see where things are. Especially that vase."

I was amazed to see that Wolfe was leaving his chair too, knowing his attitude toward all nonessential movement, but as I went to open the door to the front room for them I reflected that while he hated hearing Cramer ask questions, under the circumstances he would hate even more not hearing him, in case conversation got started in the front room. Stebbins tagged in after them, and I brought up the rear.
Jane was seated on the piano bench. Jensen was on the sofa, but arose as we entered. Fritz was standing by a window, his hand with the gun coming up as Jensen moved.
Wolfe said, "This is Inspector Cramer, Miss Geer."
She didn't make a sound or move a muscle.

He proceeded to inspect things, and so did Sergeant Stebbins. They considered distances, and the positions of various objects. Then there was this detail: from what segment of that room could a gun send a bullet through the open door to the office and on through the hole in Wolfe's chair and the one in the wall?
They were working on that together when Wolfe turned to Fritz and asked him, "What happened to the other cushion?"
Fritz was taken aback. "Other cushion?"
"There were six velvet cushions on that sofa. There are only five. Did you remove it?"

"That's right. They've been rearranged to take up the space. I don't understand it. They were all here yesterday when I cleaned in here."

"Are you sure of that?"

I finally told Wolfe, "It's gone. It isn't in here." He muttered at me, "I see it isn't."
I stared at him. There was an expression on his face that I knew well. It wasn't exactly excitement, though it always stirred excitement in me. His neck was rigid, as if to prevent any movement of the head, so as not to disturb the brain, his eyes were half shut and not seeing anything, and his lips were moving, pushing out, then relaxing, then pushing out again. I knew it would take more than the loss of a velvet cushion to produce that effect on him. I stared at him.
Suddenly he turned and spoke. "Mr. Cramer! Please leave Mr. Stebbins in here with Miss Geer and Mr. Jensen. You can stay here too, or come with me, as you prefer. Fritz and Archie, come." He headed for the office. Cramer, knowing Wolfe's tones of voice almost as well as I did, spoke to Stebbins and then followed. Fritz and I also followed. So did Jane's voice.
"This is outrageous! I want - " I shut the door.
Wolfe waited until he was in his chair before he spoke. "I want to know if that cushion is on the premises. Search the house from the cellar up - except the south room; Mr. Hackett is in there lying down. Start in here." Cramer barked, "What the hell is all this about?"

Searching the office was quite different from searching the front room. In the first place, it was a lot bigger. Also, there were a lot more places where you could hide a cushion - files, drawers, bookshelves, magazine and newspaper

None of them could be ruled out, because the shelves were deep, and it was no trivial job to pull out all those books and slide them back again. Fritz went at it with his usual deliberate thoroughness, and I couldn't have been called a whirlwind either because I was using my brain along with my hands, trying to work out how and why the fact of a missing cushion crashed into the structure like a comet shattering a world. Now and then a glance at Wolfe showed me that he was still working, his lips moving and his eyes shut.

Half an hour or so had passed, maybe a little more, when I heard him let out a grunt. I nearly toppled off the steps, turning to look at him. He was in motion. He picked up his wastebasket, which was kept at the far corner of his desk, held it so that the light shone directly into it, inspected it, shook his head, put it down again, and began opening the drawers of his desk, all the way out, and inspecting their interiors, starting with the top one on the right side. The first two, the one at the top and the one in the middle, apparently didn't get him anything, but when he yanked out the double-depth one at the bottom as far as it would go, he looked in, bent over closer to see better, stuck a hand in and seemed to be poking around, closed the drawer, got himself erect, and announced:
"I've found it."
In those three little words there was at least two tons of self-satisfaction and smirk.
We all goggled at him.
He looked at me. "Archie. Get down off that thing and don't fall. Look in your desk and see if one of my guns has been fired."

Same as the cushions. The shell is here."
"Tchah! The confounded ass! Tell Miss Geer and Mr. Jensen that they may come in here if they care to hear what happened, or they may go home or anywhere else. We don't need them. Take Mr. Stebbins upstairs with you and bring Mr.

 Hackett down here. Use caution and search him with great care. He is an extremely dangerous man and an unsurpassable idiot."

==> I had no hand in the phone call to General Fife - or rather, as I learned later, to Colonel Voss, who was on duty that evening at the downtown G-2 headquarters - because I was busy with the chores. First, with regard to Jane and Jensen. When I delivered Wolfe's message to them, in a few well-chosen words, they blinked in bewilderment, which was understandable. Then they both opened the valves and here came the steam. I silenced them by mere force of personality. <==
I told Jensen, "You came to see Wolfe to get him to help catch the murderer of your father. He has not only helped, he has done it singlehanded, practically without getting out of bed. For God's sake, what more do you want?"
I told Jane, "You wanted to avoid publicity as a suspect in a murder case so you can be a vice-president. Wolfe has done the avoiding for you. As my contribution, I have made you acquainted with this prominent major. You should beef?"
Naturally they voted for joining the throng in the office, and their pose during the balloting was significant.
They stood facing each other, with Jensen's right hand on Jane's left shoulder, and Jane's right hand, or perhaps just the fingers, on Jensen's left forearm. I left it to them to find the way to the office alone, told Purley Stebbins what our job was, and took him upstairs with me to the south room.
It was approximately ten minutes later that we delivered our cargo in the office. Even though Mr. Hackett staged one of the most convincing demonstrations of unwillingness to co-operate that I have ever encountered, beginning the instant I put a hand on him to frisk him, only about six of the ten minutes were devoted to persuading him that there were worse things than going downstairs. For the other four minutes I sat on him, examining my shin to see if his kicks had busted the skin and testing my wrist to decide if it was sprained, while Purley was in the bathroom washing blood off his cheek and neck and applying BandAids.

"Tchah! The confounded ass! Tell Miss Geer and Mr. Jensen that they may come in here if they care to hear what happened, or they may go home or anywhere else. We don't need them. Take Mr. Stebbins upstairs with you and bring Mr.

 Hackett down here. Use caution and search him with great care. He is an extremely dangerous man and an unsurpassable idiot."

I had no hand in the phone call to General Fife - or rather, as I learned later, to Colonel Voss, who was on duty that evening at the downtown G-2 headquarters - because I was busy with the chores. First, with regard to Jane and Jensen. When I delivered Wolfe's message to them, in a few well-chosen words, they blinked in bewilderment, which was understandable. Then they both opened the valves and here came the steam. I silenced them by mere force of personality.
==> I told Jensen, "You came to see Wolfe to get him to help catch the murderer of your father. He has not only helped, he has done it singlehanded, practically without getting out of bed. For God's sake, what more do you want?" <==
I told Jane, "You wanted to avoid publicity as a suspect in a murder case so you can be a vice-president. Wolfe has done the avoiding for you. As my contribution, I have made you acquainted with this prominent major. You should beef?"
Naturally they voted for joining the throng in the office, and their pose during the balloting was significant.
They stood facing each other, with Jensen's right hand on Jane's left shoulder, and Jane's right hand, or perhaps just the fingers, on Jensen's left forearm. I left it to them to find the way to the office alone, told Purley Stebbins what our job was, and took him upstairs with me to the south room.

Not that Hackett had confined himself to kicking and scratching; he hadn't confined himself at all. Purley and I did the confining.
We got him to the office in one piece, nothing really wrong with him but a few bruises, and put him in a chair. Purley took an upright position right behind him, with the evident intention of standing by, so I went to my desk. Jane and Jensen were on a couple of chairs side by side, over near the big globe. Cramer was as before.
I said, "He was reluctant."
==> I'll say one thing for Wolfe, I've never seen him gloat over a guy about to get it. He was contemplating Hackett more as an extraordinary object that deserved study. <==
I said, "Purley thinks he knows him."
Purley, as was proper, spoke to his superior. "I swear, Inspector, I'm sure I've seen him somewhere, but I can't remember."
Wolfe nodded. "A uniform makes a difference. I suggest that he was in uniform."
"Uniform?" Purley scowled. "Army?"
Wolfe shook his head. "Mr. Cramer told me Wednesday morning that the doorman on duty at the apartment house at the time Mr. Jensen and Mr. Doyle were killed was a fat nitwit who had been hired two weeks ago and didn't know the tenants by name, and also that he claimed to have been in the basement stoking the water heater at the moment the murders were committed. A phone call would tell us whether he is still working there."

"He isn't," Cramer growled. "He left Wednesday afternoon because he didn't like a place where people got murdered. I never saw him. Some of my men did."
"Yeah," Purley said, gazing at Hackett's face. "By God, it's him. I thought he didn't have brains enough to know which end to pick up a shovel."
"He is," Wolfe declared, "a remarkable combination of fool and genius. He came to New York determined to kill Mr. Jensen and me. By the way, Mr. Hackett,

Hackett made no sound and didn't flutter an eyelid.
"I guess you can," Wolfe went on. "This will interest you. I requested Military Intelligence to have an examination made of the effects of Captain Peter Root at the prison in Maryland. A few minutes ago I phoned for a report, and got it. Captain Root was lying when he stated that he was not in communication with his father and had not been for years. There are several letters from his father among his belongings, dated in the past two months, and they make it evident that his father, whose name is Thomas Root, regards him as a scion to be proud of. To the point of mania." Wolfe wiggled a finger at Hackett. "I offer the conjecture that you are in a position to know whether that is correct or not. Is it?"
"One more day," Hackett said in his husky croak.

His hands were twitching. "One more day," he repeated.
Wolfe nodded. "I know. One more day and you would have killed me, with the suspicion centered on Miss Geer or Mr. Jensen, or both, on account of your flummery here this afternoon. And you would have disappeared, probably after again complaining that you don't like a place where people get murdered."
Jensen popped up, "You haven't explained the flummery."
"I shall, Mr. Jensen." Wolfe got more comfortable in his chair. "But first that performance Tuesday evening." He was keeping his eyes on Hackett. "That was a masterpiece. You decided to kill Mr. Jensen first, which was lucky for me, and, since all apartment-house service staffs are short-handed, got a job there as doorman with no difficulty. All you had to do was await an opportunity, with no passers-by or other onlookers. It came the day after you mailed the threat, an ideal situation in every respect except the presence of the man he had hired to guard him. Arriving at the entrance to the apartment house, naturally they would have no suspicion of the doorman in uniform. Mr. Jensen probably nodded and spoke to you. With no one else in sight, and the elevator man ascending with a passenger, it was too good an opportunity to lose. Muffling the revolver with some piece of cloth, you shot Mr. Doyle in the back, and when Mr. Jensen whirled at the sound you shot him in the front and skedaddled for the stairs to the basement and started stoking the water heater. I imagine the first thing you fed it was the cloth with which you had muffled the gun."

"Only a Boy Scout's dream," I told him. "One of those knives with scissors, awl, nail file ..."

"I invite comment, anything from irony to derision, on the fact that I paid a hundred dollars a day, to get him to live in my house, eat my food, and sit in my chair, to a man who had resolved to kill me. I can afford the invitation only because, in spite of that overwhelming handicap, I shall go on living and he will not."

Nobody seemed to have any irony or derision ready, but Jensen chipped in, "You still haven't explained the flummery."

Wolfe nodded at him. "I'm getting to it, sir. Naturally, from the moment he got in here, Mr. Root was concocting schemes, rejecting, considering, revising; and no doubt relishing the situation enormously. The device of the handkerchief to protect a hand firing a gun was no doubt a part of one of those schemes, but it served admirably for the one he finally used. This morning he learned that Miss Geer was to call on me at six o'clock, and he was to impersonate me. After lunch, in here alone, he got a cushion from the sofa in there, wrapped his revolver in it, and fired a bullet through the back of this chair into the wall. He could, if he wished, have held the thing right against the back of the chair, and probably did. He stuffed the cushion into the rear compartment of the bottom right-hand drawer of this desk, having observed that the contents of the front of the drawer indicated that it was rarely opened.
He put the gun in his pocket. He kept the chair pushed back to the wall to cover the hole in the plaster. The hole in the leather was not conspicuous and he took the risk of its being seen; when he was in the chair he covered the hole with his head."

Mr. Root was not clearing up today.
"Very well. I can offer no inducement. In any event, having answered the advertisement and received a message from me, you were of course delighted, and doubly delighted when you were hired." Wolfe's eyes described an arc, including everybody in the roundup.
"I invite comment, anything from irony to derision, on the fact that I paid a hundred dollars a day, to get him to live in my house, eat my food, and sit in my chair, to a man who had resolved to kill me. I can afford the invitation only because, in spite of that overwhelming handicap, I shall go on living and he will not."

Nobody seemed to have any irony or derision ready, but Jensen chipped in, "You still haven't explained the flummery."
==> Wolfe nodded at him. "I'm getting to it, sir. Naturally, from the moment he got in here, Mr. Root was concocting schemes, rejecting, considering, revising; and no doubt relishing the situation enormously. The device of the handkerchief to protect a hand firing a gun was no doubt a part of one of those schemes, but it served admirably for the one he finally used. This morning he learned that Miss Geer was to call on me at six o'clock, and he was to impersonate me. After lunch, in here alone, he got a cushion from the sofa in there, wrapped his revolver in it, and fired a bullet through the back of this chair into the wall. He could, if he wished, have held the thing right against the back of the chair, and probably did. He stuffed the cushion into the rear compartment of the bottom right-hand drawer of this desk, having observed that the contents of the front of the drawer indicated that it was rarely opened. <==
He put the gun in his pocket. He kept the chair pushed back to the wall to cover the hole in the plaster. The hole in the leather was not conspicuous and he took the risk of its being seen; when he was in the chair he covered the hole with his head."
"If the hole had been seen the bullet would have been found," Cramer muttered.
"I have already pronounced him," Wolfe said testily, "an unsurpassable fool. Even so, he knew that Archie would be out with him the rest of the afternoon, and I would be in my room. I had made a remark which informed him that I would not sit in that chair again until he was permanently out of it. At six o'clock Miss Geer arrived, unexpectedly accompanied by Mr. Jensen. They were shown into the front room, and that door was open. Mr. Root's brain moved swiftly, and so did the rest of him. He got one of my guns from Archie's desk, returned to this chair, opened the drawer where he had put the cushion, fired a shot into the cushion, dropped the gun in, and shut the drawer."
Wolfe sighed again. "Archie came dashing in, cast a glance at Mr. Root seated here, and went on to the front room. Mr. Root grasped the opportunity to do two things: return my gun to the drawer of Archie's desk, and use a blade of his knife, I would guess the awl, to tear a gash in the corner of his ear. That of course unproved the situation for him. But what improved it vastly more was the chance that came soon after, when Archie took him to the bathroom and left him there. He might have found another chance, but that was perfect.

Cramer slowly nodded. "I'm not objecting. I'll buy it. But you must admit you've described quite a few things you can't prove."

"I can't say I blame you," Cramer grinned, which was rare. He stood up. "Let's go, Mr. Root." after letting them out and watching Cramer and Purley manipulating Hackett-Root down the steps to the sidewalk and into the police car, I shut the door without bothering about the bolt and returned to the office.

"... more than neat," Jensen was saying. "It was absolutely brilliant."
"I still can't believe it," Jane declared. "It was wonderful."
"It was merely a job," Wolfe murmured, as if he knew what modesty was.

I may not be in debt to you legally, but I am morally, and it will be a great satisfaction to pay it. I haven't my checkbook with me, so I'll have to mail you one - say, five thousand dollars?"
Wolfe shook his head. "I accept pay only from clients, as arranged in advance. If you send me a check I'll have to return it. If you have to send one in order to sleep, send it to the National War Fund."

I managed to keep my face straight. As for Wolfe's renunciation, his income for the year had already reached a point where out of an additional five grand he would have been able to keep about one-fifth. As for Jensen's generosity, if it is okay for males at one age to climb trees and turn somersaults in the presence of females, why isn't it okay for them at another age to wave checkbooks? The way Jane was looking at him reminded me of the way a fifth-grade girl looked at me once, out in Ohio, when I chinned myself fourteen times.
So they settled it on a basis of reciprocal nobility, and the pair turned to go. Not caring to appear churlish, I went to open the front door for them. As they were passing through, Jane suddenly realized I was there and stopped and impulsively extended her hand.
"I take it back, Archie. You're not a rat. Shake on it. Is he, Emil?" "He certainly is not," Emil baritoned heartily.
"Gee," I stammered with moist eyes, "this is the happiest day of my life. This will make a new rat of me."
I closed the door. back in the office, Wolfe, in his own chair with only one bullet hole that could easily be repaired, and with three bottles of beer on a tray in front of him, was leaning back with his hands resting on the chair arms and his eyes open only to slits, the picture of a man at peace.

Rex Stout
==> He paid us a visit the day he stopped the bullet. Ben Jensen was a publisher, a politician, and in my opinion a poop. I had had a sneaking idea that he would have gone ahead and bought the inside Army dope that captain Peter Root had offered to sell him if he had been able to figure out a way of using it without any risk of losing a hunk of hide. But he had played it safe and had co-operated with Nero Wolfe like a good little boy. <==
That had been a couple of months before.
Now, early on a Tuesday morning, he phoned to say he wanted to see Wolfe. When I told him that Wolfe would be occupied with the orchids, as usual, until eleven o'clock, he fussed a little and made a date for eleven sharp. He arrived five minutes ahead of time, and I escorted him into the office and invited him to deposit his big bony frame in the red leather chair. after he sat down he asked me, "Don't I remember you? Aren't you Major Goodwin?"
"Yep."
"You're not in uniform."
"I was just noticing," I said, "that you need a haircut. At your age, with your gray hair, it looks better trimmed. More distinguished. Shall we continue with the personal remarks?"

"Oh, no. For that I would charge. It was clipped from an ad for a movie called Meeting at Dawn. The movie of the century. I saw the ad last week in the American Magazine. I suppose it's in all the magazines.
If you could find - "
Wolfe made a noise at me and murmured again at Jensen, "Well, sir?" "What am I going to do?" Jensen demanded.
"I'm sure I don't know. Have you any notion who sent it?"
"No. None at all." Jensen sounded grieved. "Damn it, I don't like it. It's not just the usual junk from an anonymous crank. Look at it! It's direct and to the point. I think someone's going to try to kill me, and I don't know who or why or when or how. I suppose tracing it is out of the question, but I want some protection. I want to buy it from you."
==> I put up a hand to cover a yawn. I knew there would be nothing doing - no case, no fee, no excitement. In the years I had been living in Nero Wolfe's house on West Thirty-fifth Street, acting as a goad, prod, lever, irritant, and chief assistant in the detective business, I had heard him tell at least fifty scared people, of all conditions and ages, that if someone had determined to kill them and was going to be stubborn about it he would probably succeed. On occasion, when the bank balance was doing a dive, he had furnished Gather or Durkin or Panzer or Keems as a bodyguard at a hundred percent mark-up, but now they were all <==

 fighting Germans or Japs, and anyhow, we had just deposited a five-figure check from a certain client.
Jensen got sore, naturally, but Wolfe only murmured at him that he might succeed in interesting the police or that we would be glad to give him a list of reliable detective agencies which would provide companions for his movements as long as he remained alive - at sixty bucks for twenty-four hours. Jensen said that wasn't it, he wanted to hire Wolfe's brains.
Wolfe merely made a face and shook his head. Then Jensen wanted to know what about Goodwin? Wolfe said that Major Goodwin was an officer in the United States Army.
"He's not in uniform," Jensen growled.

"He's not in uniform," Jensen growled.
Wolfe grunted. "He’ll waste his money. I doubt the urgency of his peril. A man planning a murder doesn't spend his energy clipping pieces out of advertisements of motion pictures."
That was Tuesday. The next morning, Wednesday, the papers headlined the murder of Ben Jensen on the front page. Eating breakfast in the kitchen with Fritz, as usual, I was only halfway through the report in the Times when the doorbell rang, and when I answered it.
I found on the stoop our old friend Inspector Cramer of the Homicide Squad.
II
==> Nero Wolfe said, "Not interested, not involved, and not curious." <==
He was a sight, as he always was when propped up in bed with his breakfast tray. The custom was for Fritz to deliver the tray to his room on the second floor at eight o'clock. It was now eight-fifteen, and already down the gullet were the peaches and cream, most of the unrationed bacon, and two-thirds of the eggs, not to mention coffee and the green tomato jam. The black silk coverlet was folded back, and you had to look to tell where the yellow percale sheet ended and the yellow pajamas began. Few people except Fritz and me ever got to see him like that, but he had stretched a point for Inspector Cramer, who knew that from nine

 to eleven he would be up in the plant rooms with the orchids and unavailable.
"In the past dozen years," Cramer said in his ordinary growl, without any particular feeling, "you have told me, I suppose, in round figures, ten million lies."
The commas were chews on his unlighted cigar. He looked the way he always did when he had been working all night - peevish and put upon but under control, all except his hair, which had forgotten where the part went.

The program went smoothly, all except the Jane Geer number. If it hadn't been for her I'd have been able to make the six o'clock train with hours to spare.
Fife reported back on Root in thirty minutes, to the effect that Root was in the clink on government property down in Maryland and would be transported to New York without delay for an interview with Wolfe, which appeared to contradict the saying that democracies are always ungrateful. Cornwall said he had turned the clipping and envelope Jensen had received over to Inspector Cramer, and Cramer verified it and said he had it. But Cramer seemed to be too busy for an extended phone conversation, and I understood why when, shortly after we had finished lunch, he arrived at our place in person, sat down in the red leather chair and narrowed his eyes at Wolfe, emitted a hoarse, grating chuckle and said offensively:
"Interested, involved, and curious."
Naturally Wolfe tossed it back at him, but after three minutes of fast and hot tongue work they patched it up and discussed matters. Cramer had the Jensen clipping with him, and they compared the two and found they were from copies of the same magazine, a piece of information which I would have considered no bargain at a nickel. We emptied the bag on the Captain Root episode, all but the Jane Geer item, and Cramer said he would do a survey of Root's history and connections. as for the official investigation of the Jensen murder, they still had the entire population of the metropolitan area for suspects, which gave them plenty of room to move around in. When Cramer's recital made it evident that the squad had got nowhere at all, Wolfe saw fit to make a couple of cracks and Cramer returned the compliment, so the conference ended on the same breezy note it had begun with.
==> On Jane Geer the luck was low. When before noon I phoned the advertising agency she worked for I was told that she was somewhere in Long Island admiring some client's product for which she was to produce copy. When I finally did get her, after four o'clock, she went willful on me, presumably because she regarded my phoning five times in one day as evidence that my primal impulses had been aroused and I was beginning to pant. She would not come to Nero Wolfe's place unless I went after her and bought her a cocktail first. <==
So I met her a little after five at the Calico Room at the Churchill, and bought.


She had put in a full day's work, but looking at her you might have thought she had come straight from an afternoon nap and a relaxing bath.
It was not my opinion, at that stage of affairs, that this special item of God's second-thought bounty for man was guilty of premeditated and cold-blooded murder. because of my interest in human nature I had found occasion, in the brief period since I had first met her, to discover that she was capable of strong feelings over a wide range of territory, and that she did not believe in limiting their expression to little hints like darting the eyes. I had never seen her scratch or pull hair, but I had known her only two months or so, and unquestionably she packed the potential. However, I felt that the Jensen-Doyle massacre, one of them a perfect stranger, did not belong in her repertory; and I knew she had acquired a different slant on the Captain Root incident since the day she called Wolfe a mongrel bloodhound.

I poked it at her. She rubbed its tip gently with the tip of her own. "I wondered if it had a callus. After dialing my number five times in less than five hours. are you trying to win some kind of a bet? Or did you dream about me?" She sipped her Torn Collins, bending her head to get her lips to the straw. A strand of her hair slipped forward over an eye and a cheek, and I reached across and used the same finger to put it back in place.
"I took that liberty," I told her, "because I wish to have an unobstructed view of your lovely phiz. I want to see if you turn pale or your eyes get glassy."
"Overwhelmed by you so near?"
"No, I know that reaction - I correct for it. Anyhow I doubt if I'm magnetic right now because I'm sore at you for making me miss a train."
"I didn't phone you this time. You phoned me."
==> "Okay." I drank. "You said on the phone that you still don't like Nero Wolfe and you wouldn't go to see him unless you knew what for and maybe not even then. <==
So this is what for. He wants to ask you whether you intend to kill him yourself or hire the same gang that you got to kill Jensen and Doyle. So he'll know what

 to expect."
"Mercy." She looked my face over. "You'd better put your humor on a diet. It's taking on weight."
I shook my head. "Ordinarily I would enjoy playing catch with you, as you are aware, but I can't miss all the trains. I'm not even trying to be funny, let alone succeeding. I was instructed to tell you this if necessary. because Wolfe's life has been threatened in the same manner as Jensen's was, the supposition is that Jensen was murdered for revenge, for what he did to Captain Root. Because of the cutting remarks you made when Root was trapped, and your general attitude, there is a tendency to want to know what you have been doing lately. Wolfe wants to ask you. If you wonder why I didn't start with some grade A detecting by finding out where you were last night between eleven and twelve, that wouldn't help any because what if you hired - "

"Stop." She stopped me. "I'm dreaming." "I'm not."
"It's fantastic."
"Sure. Lots of things are."
==> "Nero Wolfe seriously thinks I - did that? Or had it done?" "I didn't say so. He wants to discuss it with you." <==
Her eyes flashed. Her tone took on an edge. "It is also extremely corny. And the police? Have you kindly arranged that when Wolfe finishes with me I proceed to headquarters? Would you be good enough to phone my boss in the morning and let him know where I am? I can't begin to tell you - "
"Listen, Tiger-eyes." She let me cut her off, which was a pleasant surprise. "Have you noticed me sneaking up on you from behind? If so, draw it for me. I have explained a situation. Your name has not been mentioned to the police, though they have consulted us. You are, let us assume, as innocent as a cheeping chick, which you do not, however, resemble in visible physical aspects."
"Thank you." The edge was even sharper.

"It sounds fascinating." Her eyes suddenly changed, and the line of her lips. She had been struck with an idea. "I wonder," she said.
"What is it, and we'll both wonder."
"Sure." Her eyes had changed more. "This wouldn't by any chance be a climax you've been working up to?
You with a thousand girls and women so that you have to issue ration books so many minutes to a coupon, and yet finding so much time for me? Leading up, heaven knows why, and I don't care to go to heaven to find out, to this idiotic frame - "
"Turn that one off," I broke in, "or I'll begin to get suspicious myself. You know darned well why I have found time for you, having a mirror as you do. I have been experimenting to test my emotional reaction to form, color, touch, and various perfumes, and I have been deeply grateful for your co-operation. For you to pretend to imagine that the experiment we have been carrying on was on my part preparation for a frame-up for murder is an insult both to my intelligence and my emotional integrity."
==> "Ha, ha." She stood up, her eyes not softening nor her tone melting. "I am going to see Nero Wolfe. I welcome an opportunity to reveal myself to Nero Wolfe. Do I go or are you taking me?" <==
I took her. I paid the check and we went out and got a taxi. during the brief ride downtown and crosstown she got more realistic. She said, among other things, "I was taken in by Peter Root. I thought he was innocent and was being made the goat. So I expressed myself accordingly, and why shouldn't I? But I am over all that, as you know unless you are a two-faced subhuman Pithecanthropus, and

 this business about the murder of that Jensen, which I read about in the morning paper, is utter poppycock. I'm a working girl. After my experience with the charming, irresistible Peter I wouldn't marry a combination of Winston Churchill and Victor Mature. I wouldn't even marry you. I have a future. I intend to become the first female vice-president of the biggest advertising agency in the country. I never will, or anyway not for years, if my name is made public as a suspect in a murder case. The publicity about me in the Peter Root business didn't help me any, and this would about finish me."
"Don't," I advised her, "take that line with Nero Wolfe. His attitude toward women as business executives is a little peculiar, not to mention his attitude toward women."
"I'll handle Nero Wolfe." "Hooray. No one ever has yet."

I didn't get to see her try, because she didn't get to see Wolfe. Since chain-bolt orders were in effect, my key wouldn't let us in and I had to ring the doorbell for Fritz. I had just pushed the button when who should appear, mounting the steps to join us on the stoop, but the Army officer that they use for a model when they want to do a picture conveying the impression that masculine comeliness will win the war. I admit he was handsome; I admitted it to myself right then, when I first saw him. He looked preoccupied and concentrated, but even so he found time for a glance at Jane, which was actually nothing against him, especially when you consider that she also found time for a glance at him. at that moment the door swung open and I spoke to Fritz. "Okay, thanks. Is Mr. Wolfe in the office?"
"No, he's up in his room."
"All right, I'll take it." Fritz departed, and I maneuvered into position to dominate the scene, on the doorsill facing out. I spoke to the masculine model.
"Yes, Major? This is Nero Wolfe's place."

"I know it is." He had a baritone voice that suited him to a T. "I want to see him. My name is Emil Jensen. I am the son of Ben Jensen, who was killed last night."

 to do. "Mr. Wolfe has an appointment. It would be handy if I could tell him what you want."
"I want to - consult him. If you don't mind, I'd rather tell him." He smiled to take the sting off. Probably Psychological Warfare Branch.

After the war I intend to run for Congress and put through laws about generals. I

 have a theory that generals should be rubbed liberally with neat's-foot oil before being taken out and shot. Though I doubt if I would have bothered with the oil in the case of General Carpenter that morning if I had had a free hand.
I was a major. So I sat and said yessir, yessir, yessir, while he told me that he had given me the appointment only because he thought I wanted to discuss something of importance, and that I would stay where I was put, and that the question of my going overseas had been decided long ago and I would shut my trap about it. I never found out whether Wolfe had phoned him or not.
He didn't phone Wolfe. He didn't even pat me on the head and tell me there, there, be a good soldier. He merely said, in effect, nuts. Then he observed that since I was in Washington I might as well confer with the staff on various cases, finished and unfinished, and would I report immediately to Colonel Dickey.
==> I doubt if I made a good impression, considering my state of mind. They kept me around, conferring, all day Thursday and most of Friday. I phoned Wolfe that I was detained. By explaining the situation on Thirty-fifth Street I could have got permission to beat it back to New York, but I wasn't going to give that collection of brass headgear an excuse to giggle around that Nero Wolfe didn't have brains enough to arrange to keep on breathing, in his own house, without me there to look after him. Besides, I knew that Carpenter would have phoned Wolfe, out of courtesy as well as concern, and Wolfe's reaction to that when I got back would be apt to displease me. but I was tempted to hop a plane when, late Thursday evening, I saw the ad in the Star. I had been too busy all day, and at dinner with a bunch of them and after, to take a look at a New York paper. I was alone in my hotel room when it caught my eye, bordered and spaced to make a spot: <==
WANTED A MAN weighing about 260-270, around 5 ft. 11, 45-56 years old, medium in coloring, waist not over 48, capable of easy and normal movement. Temporary. Hazardous. $100 a day. Send photo with letter. Box 292 Star.
I read it through four times, stared at it disapprovingly for an additional two minutes, and then reached for the phone and put in a New York call. It was going on midnight, but Wolfe never went to bed early. But when the connection was made, after a short wait, it wasn't his voice that I heard. It was Fritz Brenner's.
"Mr. Nero Wolfe's residence."

Fritz, who had been with Wolfe even longer than me, had his own ideas about certain details. When he answered the phone in the daytime between nine and five he said, "Mr. Nero Wolfe's office." At any other time he said, "Mr. Nero Wolfe's residence."
"Hello, Fritz. Archie. Calling from Washington. Where's Mr. Wolfe?"
"He's in bed. He had a hard day. And evening."

"Oh. He did. Using my typewriter. Do you happen to know whether he looked at the Star today?"

"Get it, and look at an ad, a small one in a box, near the lower right corner on page eleven. Read it. I'll hold the wire."
I sat and waited. Before long he was back on.
"I read it." He sounded puzzled. "Are you calling clear from Washington to make a joke?"
"I am not. I don't feel like joking. The Army won't let me go anywhere. They turned me down. As you read the ad, who did it make you think of?"
"Well - it entered my mind that it was just about a good description of Mr. Wolfe."
==> "Yeah, it entered mine too. If whoever wrote that wasn't thinking of Nero Wolfe, I'll eat it. First thing in the morning, show it to him. Tell him it looks to me - no, just show it to him. It would annoy him to be told how it looks to me. Anyhow, it will look to him the same way. How's everything?" <==
"All right."


"The bolts and the gong and so forth?"
"Yes. With you away - "

"The bolts and the gong and so forth?"
"Yes. With you away - "
"I'll be back tomorrow - I hope. Probably late afternoon."
==> Getting ready for bed, I tried to figure out in what manner, if I were making preparations to kill Nero Wolfe, I could make use of an assistant, hired on a temporary basis at a hundred bucks a day, who was a physical counterpart of Wolfe. The two schemes I devised weren't very satisfactory, and the one I hit on after I got my head on the pillow was even worse, so I flipped the switch on the nervous system and let the muscles quit. <==
In the morning I went to the Pentagon Building and started conferring again, but it was a lot of hooey. There wasn't anything they really needed me for, and I didn't pretend, even to be polite, that I needed them.
Still it went on. By three in the afternoon they seemed to be taking me for granted, as if I belonged there. A feeling that I was doomed began to ooze into me. The Pentagon had got me and would never turn me loose. I was on my way down its throat, and once it got me into its stomach and the machinery began to chum me and squirt dissolving juice over me, at five o'clock I called up all my reserves and told a colonel, "Looky. Don't you think, sir, I've done all I can here? Would it not be advisable for me to return to my post in New York?"
"Well." He lifted his chin to consider. "I'll ask Major Zabreskie. He will of course have to consult Colonel Shawn. It will have to go through - when did you get here?"
"Yesterday morning."
"Whom did you see first on arrival?"

"Oh. The devil." He looked worried. "Then it will have to go to him, and he's tied up. I'll tell you what we'd better do."
He told me what we'd better do. I listened attentively, but it didn't register. Doomed was no word for it.


I was sunk for the duration, possibly for life. I told him there was no great rush, it could wait till morning. I would ask Major Zabreskie myself, and managed to break away from him. I got into a corridor, made it to the ground floor, used all my faculties, and succeeded in breaking through to the open air. My trained mind and years of experience as a detective got me onto the right bus. Five minutes at the hotel were enough to get my bag and pay my bill, and I shared a taxi to the airport and bought a ticket to New York. Eating could wait, but it didn't. I did. There was no room on either the six-thirty or the seven-thirty, so, with both appetite and time, I tried four kinds of sandwiches and found them all edible. Finally I got a seat on the eight-thirty plane, and when it landed at La Guardia Field an hour and a half later I began to feel safe. Surely I could elude them in the throngs of the great metropolis. Actually I was offering ten to one that by morning everybody at the Pentagon would have forgotten that I had been there. arriving at Wolfe's house on Thirty-fifth Street a little before eleven, I didn't get out my key because I knew the door would be bolted and I would need help. I gave the button three short pushes as usual, and in a moment there were footsteps, and the curtain was pulled aside, and Fritz was peering at me through the glass panel. Satisfied, he let me in and greeted me with a tone and expression indicating that he was pleased to see me. I saw Wolfe was in the office, since the door to it was open and the light shining through, so I breezed down the hall and on in.
==> "I am a fug—" I began, and stopped. Wolfe's chair behind his desk, his own chair and no one else's under any circumstances, was occupied by the appropriate mass of matter in comparatively human shape, in other words by a big fat man, but it wasn't Nero Wolfe. I had never seen him before. <==
V
Fritz, who had stayed to bolt the door, came at me from behind, talking. The occupant of the chair neither moved nor spoke, but merely leered at me. I would have called it a leer. I became aware that Fritz was telling me that Mr. Wolfe was up in his room.
The specimen in the chair said in a husky croak, "I suppose you're Goodwin. Archie. Have a good trip?"

 know me seven weeks.
In the morning, breakfast was all over the place, with Wolfe in his room, Hackett in the dining-room, and me in the kitchen with Fritz. Afterwards I spent an hour up in the plant rooms with Wolfe, on the matters we usually attended to in the office, together with consideration of the current problem. Wolfe asked if I had decided whether we should get a chauffeur for Hackett from the Homicide Squad.
I looked judicious. "I have," I told him, "thought it over from all angles. Unquestionably Cramer could give us a man who would be my superior in courage, wit, integrity, reflex time, and purity of morals. But here's the trouble— not one anything like as handsome as me. Not a chance. So I'll do it myself."
Wolfe cocked an eye at me. "I meant no offense. My intentions—"
"Forget it. You're under a strain. Mr. Hackett's life is in jeopardy and it makes you nervous."
==> We got to details. Jane Geer was making a nuisance of herself. I understood now, of course, why Wolfe had refused to see her Wednesday evening. After sending me to get her he had conceived the strategy of hiring a double, and he didn't want her to get a look at the real Nero Wolfe because if she did she would be less likely to be deceived by the counterfeit and go to work on him. That meant she was seriously on his list, but I didn't take the trouble to inform him that in my opinion he could cross her off, since he would only have grunted. <==
She had phoned several times, insisting on seeing him, and had come to the house Friday morning and argued for five minutes with Fritz through the three- inch crack which the chain bolt permitted the door to open to. Now Wolfe had an idea for one of his elaborate charades. I was to phone her to come to see Wolfe at six o'clock that afternoon. When she came I was to take her in to Hackett. Wolfe would coach Hackett for the interview.
I looked skeptical. Wolfe said, "It will give her a chance to kill Mr. Hackett." I snorted. "With me right there to tell her when to cease firing!"
"I admit it is unlikely. Also, it will convince her that Mr. Hackett' is me." "Which still will not shorten his life or lengthen yours."

"Possibly not. Also, it will give me an opportunity to see her and tiear her. I shall be at the hole."
So that was really the idea. He would be in the passage, a start of an alcove, at the kitchen end of the downstairs hall, looking through into the office by means of the square hole in the wall. The hole was camouflaged on the office side by a picture that was transparent one way. He loved to have an excuse to use it, and it actually had been a help now and then.
"That's different," I told him. "If you see her and hear her you'll know she has a heart of platinum."
Major Jensen had phoned once and been told that Wolfe was engaged; apparently he wasn't as persistent as Jane. He be told Cramer that he had come to see Wolfe on Wednesday because on Tuesday morning his father had shown him the threat he had received in the mail and had announced that he was going to consult
==> Nero Wolfe about it; and the major, wishing his father's murderer to be caught and punished, had wanted to talk with Wolfe. It was Wolfe's veto of my suggestion that Major Jensen be invited to call, not on Hackett but on Wolfe himself, that showed me the state he was in. <==
Ordinarily it would have needed no suggestion from me, since the major, in his present situation, was a natural for a fat fee.
When I got down to the office Hackett was there in Wolfe's chair, eating cookies and getting crumbs on the desk. I had told him good morning previously, and having nothing else to tell him, ignored him. From the phone on my desk I got Jane Geer at her office.
"Archie," I told her.
She snapped, "Archie who?"
"Oh, come, come. We haven't sicked the police onto you, have we? Let's gossip a while."

She snapped, "Archie who?"
"Oh, come, come. We haven't sicked the police onto you, have we? Let's gossip a while."
"I am ringing off."


==> "Then I am too. In a moment. Nero Wolfe wants to see you." "He does? Ha, ha. He doesn't act like it." <==
"He has reformed. I showed him a lock of your hair. I showed him a picture of Elsa Maxwell and told him it was you. This time he won't let me come after you."
"Neither will I."
"Okay. Be here at six o'clock and you will be received. Six o'clock today, p.m. Will you?"
She admitted that she would. I made a couple of other calls and did some miscellaneous chores. But I found that my jaw was getting clamped tighter and tighter on account of an irritating noise. Finally I spoke to the occupant of Wolfe's chair. "What kind of cookies are those?"
"Ginger snaps." Evidently the husky croak was his normal voice. "I didn't know we had any."

"Yes, sir." but as it turned out, I wasn't able to obey orders. It was then nearly six o'clock. When the doorbell rang a few minutes later and I went to answer it, glancing in at the office on my way down the hall to make sure that Hackett didn't have his feet up on the desk, I opened the door to find that Miss Geer hadn't ventured alone on the streets of the great city after all. Major Emil Jensen was there with her.
VI
I had the door open. It wouldn't have been courteous to slam it shut again and leave them on the stoop while I considered matters, so I dallied on the doorsill.
"Well," I said brightly, "two on one hook?"
Jensen said hello. Jane said, "You couldn't have had that thought up, because Major Jensen decided to come on the spur of the moment. We were having cocktails."
==> She looked me up and down; it was true that I was sort of blocking the way and not moving. "May we come in?" certainly I could have told Jensen we only had one extra chair so he had better go for a walk, but if there was going to be anything accomplished by having either of those two get the idea that Hackett was Nero Wolfe, I would have picked him for the experiment rather than her. On the other hand, with Hackett primed only for her it would have been crowding our luck to confront him with both of them; and anyway, I couldn't take such a chance on my own hook. I needed advice from headquarters. So I decided to herd them into the front room, and ask them to wait, and go to consult Wolfe. <==
"Sure," I said hospitably, "enter." I gave them gangway, and when they were in, shut the door and opened the door to the front room. "In there, please. Find seats. If you don't mind waiting a minute - "

had got myself headed back for the hall before noticing an unfortunate fact: the door from the front room to the office was standing open. That was careless of me, but I hadn't expected complications. If they moved across, as they naturally would, Hackett sitting in the office would be in plain sight. But what the hell, that was what he was there for. So I kept going, down the hall to the turn into the alcove at the far end, found Wolfe there ready to take position at the peep-hole, and muttered to him:
"She brought an outrider along. Major Jensen. I put them in the front room. The door into the office is open.
Well?"

He sniffed. "No." He felt the barrel, found it cold, and shook his head.
I said, "But a gun was fired inside here. Do you smell it?"
"Certainly I smell it."
"Okay. Let's join Mr. Wolfe and discuss it. Through there." I indicated the door to the office with a flourish of the gun.
Jane started jabbering, but I paid no attention. She was merely jabbering, something indignant about a put-up job and so on. She was disinclined to enter the office, but when Jensen went she followed him and I brought up the rear.
==> "This is Mr. Nero Wolfe," I said. "Sit down." I was using my best judgment and figured I was playing it right because Wolfe was nowhere in sight. I had to decide what to do with them while I found the gun and maybe the bullet. Jane was still trying to jabber, but she stopped when Jensen blurted, "Wolfe has blood on his head!" <==
I stared at Hackett. He was standing up behind the desk, leaning forward with his hand resting on the desk, looking the three of us over with an expression that left it open whether he was dazed, scared, or angry, or all three. He didn't seem to hear Jensen's words. When I did I saw the blood on Hackett's left ear and dribbling down the side of his neck.
I took in a breath and yelled, "Fritz!"
He appeared instantly, probably having been standing by in the hall by Wolfe's direction. I told him to come here, and when he came handed him my gun. "If anybody reaches for a handkerchief, shoot."
"Those instructions," Jensen said sharply, "are dangerous if he - "

"I would like you to search me." Jensen stuck his hands toward the ceiling.
"That," I said, " is more like it," and crossed to him and explored him from neck to ankles, invited him to relax in a chair, and turned to Jane. She darted me a look of pure and lofty disgust and backed away as from a noxious miasma.
I remarked, "If you refuse to stand inspection and then you happen to make a gesture and Fritz shoots you in the tummy, don't blame me."
She darted more looks, but took it. I felt her over not quite as comprehensively as I had Jensen, took her bag and glanced in it and returned it to her, and then stepped around Wolfe's desk to examine Hackett's blood. He wasn't screaming or moaning, but the expression on his face was something. After Jensen had announced the blood, he had put his hand up to feel, and he was staring at the red on his fingers with his big jaw hanging open.
"My head?" he croaked. "Is it my head?"
==> The exhibition he was making of himself was no help to Nero Wolfe's reputation for intrepidity. After a brief look I told him distinctly, "No, sir. Nothing but a nick in the upper outside corner of your ear." I wiped with my handkerchief. "You might go to the bathroom and use a towel." <==
"I am not - hurt?"
I could have murdered him. Instead, I told Fritz, standing there with my gun, that unnecessary movements were still forbidden, and took Hackett to the bathroom in the far corner and shut the door behind me.
While I showed him the ear in the mirror and dabbed on some iodine and taped on a bandage, I told him to stay in there until his nerves calmed down and then rejoin us, act detached and superior, and let me do the talking.
He said he would, but at that moment I would have traded him for one wet cigarette. as I reappeared in the office, Jane shot at me, "Did you search him?" I ignored her and circled around Wolfe's desk for a look at the back of the chair. The head-rest was upholstered in brown leather; and about eight inches from the top and a foot from the side edge, a spot that would naturally have been on a line behind Hackett's left ear as he sat, there was a hole in the leather. I looked

This," I said cheerfully, "is a veteran revolver, a Granville thirty-eight, which has been fired not too long ago." I lowered it gently onto my desk. "Fritz, give me back my gun." He brought it. I kept it in my hand.
"Thank you. I found this other affair in the vase on the table in there, dressed in a handkerchief. Five unused cartridges and one used. It's a stranger here. Never saw it before. It appears to put the finishing touch on a critical situation."
Jane exploded. She cabled me an unspeakable rat. She said she wanted a lawyer and intended to go to one immediately. She called Hackett three or four things. She said it was the dirtiest frame-up in history. "Now," she told Hackett, "I know damned well you framed Peter Root. I let that skunk Goodwin talk me out of it!"
She was out of her chair, spitting fire. It was spectacular. "You won't get away with it this time! You incredible louse!"
Hackett was trying to talk back to her, making his voice louder and louder, and when she stopped for breath he could be heard.
==> "... will not tolerate it;! You come here and try to kill me! You nearly do kill me! Then you abuse me about a Peter Root and I have never heard of Peter Root!" He was putting real feeling into it; apparently he had either forgotten that he was supposed to be Nero Wolfe, or had got the notion, in all the excitement, that he really was Nero Wolfe. He was proceeding, "Young lady, listen to me! I will not -" <==
She turned and made for the door. I was immediately on my feet and after her, but halfway across the room I put on the brake, because the doorway had suddenly filled up with a self-propelled massive substance and she couldn't get through. She stopped, goggle-eyed, and then fell back a couple of paces. The massive substance advanced) halted, and used its mouth.
"How do you do. I am Nero Wolfe."

He did it well, at top form, and it was quite an effect. Nobody made a chirp. He

 moved forward, and Jane retreated again, moving backwards without looking around and nearly tripping on Jensen's feet. Wolfe stopped at the corner of his desk and wiggled a finger at Hackett.
"Take another chair, sir, if you please?"

He held out his hand for the gun. I gave it to him and went.
If the situation in the front room had been unjovial, the one in the office was absolutely grim. One glance at Wolfe was enough to see that he was in a state of uncontrollable fury, because his forefinger was making the same circle, over and over, on the surface of his desk. Sergeant Purley Stebbins was standing by the wall, looking official. Inspector Cramer was in the red leather chair, with his face about the color of the chair.
Nobody bothered to glance at me. Wolfe snapped, "Your notebook."
I crossed to my desk and got book and pencil and sat down. "This," I observed, "is what comes of my not attending to the doorbell. If we didn't want company - "
"Pfui." Wolfe tapped a piece of paper on his desk. "Look at this."
==> I arose and looked. It was a search warrant. "The premises ... owned and inhabited by said Nero Wolfe ... situate ..." <==
Wowie. I was surprised that Cramer was still alive, or Wolfe either. Cramer growled, holding himself in, "I'll try to forget what you just said, Wolfe. It was totally uncalled for. Goddam it, you have given me a runaround too many times. There I was, with that gun. A bullet fired from it matched the bullet you sent me and also the two that killed Jensen and Doyle. That's the gun, and you sent it to me. All right, then you've got a client, and when you've got a client you keep

 him right in your pocket. I would have been a goddam fool to come here and start begging you. I've begged you before."
Wolfe had started making the circle again. "I repeat, sir," he murmured, "that your acceptance of your salary constitutes a fraud on the people of New York and you are a disgrace to an honorable profession."
Cramer’s face had reached the red of the chair and was going on from there. "Then," he said, "I won't try to forget it. We're going to search this house." He started to leave the chair.

"It sure is a coincidence," I remarked, grinning at him.
III
I thought he would at least mutter "Indeed," but he didn't. He looked at the exhibits for a moment without touching them, sent me a sharp glance indicating an instantaneous suspicion that I was implicated, and said without any perceptible quiver, "I'll look over the mail at eleven o'clock as usual."
It was the grand manner all right. Seeing he was impervious, I retrieved the exhibits without a word, returned to the office, and busied myself with the chores - letters to write, vital statistics of orchids to enter on cards, and similar manly tasks. Nor did he fudge on the time. It was eleven on the dot when he came down, got into his oversized chair behind his desk, and began the routine - going through the mail I had not discarded, signing checks, inspecting the bank balance, dictating letters and memos, glancing down at his calendar pad, and ringing for beer. Not until Fritz had brought the beer and he had irrigated his interior did he lean back in his chair, let his eyes go half shut, and observe:
==> "Archie, you could easily have clipped that thing from the magazine, bought an envelope and printed my name and address on it, stamped it and mailed it. Nothing would have been simpler." <==
I grinned at him and shook my head. "Not my style. besides, what for? I never exert myself without a purpose. Besides again, would I be apt to infuriate and embitter you at this moment, when I know General Carpenter will phone for your opinion?"
"You will, of course, postpone your trip to Washington."
I let my frank, open countenance betray surprise. "I can't. I have an appointment with a lieutenant general; anyhow, why?" I indicated the envelope and clipping on his desk. "That tomfoolery? No panic is called for. I doubt the urgency of your peril. A man planning a murder doesn't spend his energy clipping pieces out of adver—"
"You are going to Washington?"

 to do. "Mr. Wolfe has an appointment. It would be handy if I could tell him what you want."
"I want to - consult him. If you don't mind, I'd rather tell him." He smiled to take the sting off. Probably Psychological Warfare Branch.
"I'll see. Come on in." I made room for Jane and he followed her. After attending to the bolt I escorted them to the office, invited them to sit, and went to the phone on my desk and buzzed Wolfe's room extension.
"Yes?" Wolfe's voice came.
==> "Archie. Miss Geer is here. Also Major Emil Jensen just arrived. He is the son of Ben Jensen and prefers to tell you what he wants to consult you about." <==
"Give them both my regrets. I am engaged and can see no one." "Engaged for how long?"
"Indefinitely. I can make no appointments for this week."
"But you may remember - "
"Archie! Tell them that, please." The line died.
So I told them that. They were not pleased. The Lord knows what kind of a performance Jane would have put on if she hadn't been restrained by the presence of a stranger; as it was, she didn't have to fumble around for pointed remarks. Jensen wasn't indignant, but he sure was stubborn. During an extended conversation that got nowhere, I noticed a gradual increase in their inclination to cast sympathetic glances at each other, which I suppose was only natural since they were both in a state of irritation at the same person for the same reason. I thought it might help matters along, meaning they might clear out sooner, if I changed the subject, so I said emphatically, "Miss Geer, this is Major Jensen."

He got to his feet, bowed to her like a man who knows how to bow, and told her, "How do you do. It looks as if it's hopeless, at least for this evening, for both of us. I'll have to hunt a taxi, and it would be a pleasure if you'll let me drop you ..."
So they left together. Going down the stoop, which I admit was moderately steep, he indicated not obtrusively that he had an arm there, and she rested her

 fingers in the bend of it to steady herself. That alone showed astonishing progress in almost no time at all, for she was by no means a born clinger.

I read it through four times, stared at it disapprovingly for an additional two minutes, and then reached for the phone and put in a New York call. It was going on midnight, but Wolfe never went to bed early. But when the connection was made, after a short wait, it wasn't his voice that I heard. It was Fritz Brenner's.
"Mr. Nero Wolfe's residence."


Fritz, who had been with Wolfe even longer than me, had his own ideas about certain details. When he answered the phone in the daytime between nine and five he said, "Mr. Nero Wolfe's office." At any other time he said, "Mr. Nero Wolfe's residence."
==> "Hello, Fritz. Archie. Calling from Washington. Where's Mr. Wolfe?" <==
"He's in bed. He had a hard day. And evening."
"Doing what?"
"He was very busy on the telephone. Also some callers. Mr. Cramer. And he had that stenographer from that place."
"Oh. He did. Using my typewriter. Do you happen to know whether he looked at the Star today?"
"The Star?' Fritz hesitated. "Not that I know of. He never does. There is only my copy, and it's in the kitchen."

I was sunk for the duration, possibly for life. I told him there was no great rush, it could wait till morning. I would ask Major Zabreskie myself, and managed to break away from him. I got into a corridor, made it to the ground floor, used all my faculties, and succeeded in breaking through to the open air. My trained mind and years of experience as a detective got me onto the right bus. Five minutes at the hotel were enough to get my bag and pay my bill, and I shared a taxi to the airport and bought a ticket to New York. Eating could wait, but it didn't. I did. There was no room on either the six-thirty or the seven-thirty, so, with both appetite and time, I tried four kinds of sandwiches and found them all edible. Finally I got a seat on the eight-thirty plane, and when it landed at La Guardia Field an hour and a half later I began to feel safe. Surely I could elude them in the throngs of the great metropolis. Actually I was offering ten to one that by morning everybody at the Pentagon would have forgotten that I had been there. arriving at Wolfe's house on Thirty-fifth Street a little before eleven, I didn't get out my key because I knew the door would be bolted and I would need help. I gave the button three short pushes as usual, and in a moment there were footsteps, and the curtain was pulled aside, and Fritz was peering at me through the glass panel. Satisfied, he let me in and greeted me with a tone and expression indicating that he was pleased to see me. I saw Wolfe was in the office, since the door to it was open and the light shining through, so I breezed down the hall and on in.
"I am a fug—" I began, and stopped. Wolfe's chair behind his desk, his own chair and no one else's under any circumstances, was occupied by the appropriate mass of matter in comparatively human shape, in other words by a big fat man, but it wasn't Nero Wolfe. I had never seen him before.
V
Fritz, who had stayed to bolt the door, came at me from behind, talking. The occupant of the chair neither moved nor spoke, but merely leered at me. I would have called it a leer. I became aware that Fritz was telling me that Mr. Wolfe was up in his room.
==> The specimen in the chair said in a husky croak, "I suppose you're Goodwin. Archie. Have a good trip?" <==


I stared at him. In a way I wished I was back at the Pentagon, and in another way I wished I had come sooner.
He said, "Fritz, bring me another highball." Fritz said, "Yes, sir."
He said, "Have a good trip, Archie?"

That was enough of that. I marched out to the hall and up a flight, went to Wolfe's door and tapped on it, and called, "Archie!" Wolfe's voice told me to come in, and I entered. He was seated in his number two chair, under the light, reading a book. He was fully dressed, and there was nothing in his appearance to indicate that he had lost his mind.
I did not intend to give him the satisfaction of sitting there smirking and enjoying fireworks. "Well," I said casually, "I got back. If you're sleepy we can wait till morning for conversation."
"I'm not sleepy." He closed the book with a finger inserted at his page. "Are you going to Europe?"
"You know damn well I'm not." I sat down. "We can discuss that at some future date when I'm out of the army. It's a relief to find you all alive and well around here. It's very interesting down in Washington. Everybody on their toes."
"No doubt. Did you stop in the office downstairs?"

==> "Archie. Shut up." <==
"Yes, sir. Shall I go down and chat with him?"


Wolfe put the book down and shifted in his chair with the routine grunts. When the new equilibrium was established he said, "You will find details about him on a slip of paper in the drawer of your desk. He is a retired architect named H. H. Hackett, out of funds, and an unsurpassed nincompoop with the manners of a wart hog. I chose him, from those answering the advertisement, because his appearance and build were the most suitable and he is sufficiently an ass to be willing to risk his life for a hundred dollars a day."
"If he keeps on calling me Archie the risk will become - "

"If you please." Wolfe wiggled a finger at me. "Do you think the idea of him sitting there in my chair is agreeable to me? He may be dead tomorrow or the next day. I told him that. This afternoon he went to Mr. Ditson's place in a taxicab to look at orchids, and came back ostentatiously carrying two plants. Tomorrow afternoon you will drive him somewhere and bring him back, and again in the evening. Dressed for the street, wearing my hat and lightweight coat, carrying my stick, he would deceive anyone except you."
I offered a contribution, deadpan. "I know a young lady, an actress, who would do a swell job of make-up on him if - "

"Until what?"
"Until the bird that killed Jensen is caught."
"Bah." He glared at me. "By whom? By Mr. Cramer? What do you suppose he is doing now? Pfui. Major Jensen, Mr. Jensen's son, arriving home on leave from Europe five days ago, learned that during his absence his father had sued his mother for divorce. The father and son quarreled, which was not unique. But Mr. Cramer has a hundred men trying to collect evidence that will convict Major Jensen of killing his father! Utterly intolerable asininity. For what motive could Major Jensen have for killing me, or threatening to?"

 to the point of rashness. He can probably be tempted to proceed with his program. I am aware that if you drive Mr. Hackett around, and accompany him into the car and out of it, crossing sidewalks at all hours of the day and night, you may get killed. That sort of thing was understood when I employed you and paid you. Now the government pays you. Perhaps Mr. Cramer has a man who resembles you and could be assigned to this. He would have to be a good man, alert and resourceful, for there's no point to this if an attempt on Mr. Hackett's life leaves us as empty-handed as we are now. You can give me your decision in the morning."
I'm surprised that I was able to speak at all. He had of course insulted me a million times, as I had him, but this was worse than an insult, there was no word for it. coming on top of the turndown I had got in Washington, which had reduced my buoyancy to a record low, it made me so mad that I knew I'd better get out of there. but I did not intend to let him go to bed feeling noble, so I grinned at him and controlled my voice.
"Okay," I told him. "I'll think it over. Sure, Cramer has a lot of good men. Let you know in the morning. I'll remember to turn the gong on."
I went up to my room.
The gong was a dingus under my bed. The custom was that when I retired at night I turned a switch, and if anyone put his foot down in the hall within ten feet of Wolfe's door the gong gonged. It had been installed on account of a certain occurrence some years previously, when Wolfe had got a knife stuck in him. The thing had never gone off except when we tested it, and in my opinion never would, but I never failed to switch it on because if Wolfe had stepped into the hall some night and the gong hadn't sounded it would have caused discussion.
==> This night, with a stranger in the house, I was glad it was there. I learned from Fritz that H. H. Hackett was sleeping in the south room, on the same floor as me, and on the basis of my brief acquaintance and my one look at him it wouldn't have surprised me if he had undertaken to sneak into Wolfe's room during the night and kill him, dispose of the body down in the furnace, and expect Fritz and me to take him for Wolfe and never catch on. Women and girls of appropriate age and configuration may call me Archie and welcome. With the rest of my fellow beings I am particular. The Hackett person would have had to know me seven years to get the privilege, and I neither desired nor intended that he should <==

 know me seven weeks.
In the morning, breakfast was all over the place, with Wolfe in his room, Hackett in the dining-room, and me in the kitchen with Fritz. Afterwards I spent an hour up in the plant rooms with Wolfe, on the matters we usually attended to in the office, together with consideration of the current problem. Wolfe asked if I had decided whether we should get a chauffeur for Hackett from the Homicide Squad.
I looked judicious. "I have," I told him, "thought it over from all angles. Unquestionably Cramer could give us a man who would be my superior in courage, wit, integrity, reflex time, and purity of morals. But here's the trouble— not one anything like as handsome as me. Not a chance. So I'll do it myself."
Wolfe cocked an eye at me. "I meant no offense. My intentions—"

"That's different," I told him. "If you see her and hear her you'll know she has a heart of platinum."
Major Jensen had phoned once and been told that Wolfe was engaged; apparently he wasn't as persistent as Jane. He be told Cramer that he had come to see Wolfe on Wednesday because on Tuesday morning his father had shown him the threat he had received in the mail and had announced that he was going to consult
Nero Wolfe about it; and the major, wishing his father's murderer to be caught and punished, had wanted to talk with Wolfe. It was Wolfe's veto of my suggestion that Major Jensen be invited to call, not on Hackett but on Wolfe himself, that showed me the state he was in.
Ordinarily it would have needed no suggestion from me, since the major, in his present situation, was a natural for a fat fee.
When I got down to the office Hackett was there in Wolfe's chair, eating cookies and getting crumbs on the desk. I had told him good morning previously, and having nothing else to tell him, ignored him. From the phone on my desk I got Jane Geer at her office.
==> "Archie," I told her. <==
She snapped, "Archie who?"
"Oh, come, come. We haven't sicked the police onto you, have we? Let's gossip a while."
"I am ringing off."

Wolfe spoke to the point. I hung up and turned to Hackett and spoke to the point. He was not to leave the house except as instructed by Wolfe or me. He seemed unimpressed and unconcerned, but nodded good-naturedly.
"All right," he said, "if that's the bargain I'll keep it. but there's two sides to a bargain. I was to be paid daily in advance, and I haven't been paid for today. A hundred dollars net."


Wolfe had told me the same, so I took five twenties from the expense wallet and forked it over.
==> "I must say," he commented, folding the bills neatly and stuffing them in his waistband pocket, "this is a large return for a small effort. I am aware that I may earn it - ah, suddenly and unexpectedly." He leaned toward me. "Though I may tell you confidentially, Archie, that I expect nothing to happen. I am sanguine by nature." <==
"Yeah," I told him, "me too." I opened the drawer of my desk, the middle one on the right, where I kept armament, got out the shoulder holster and put it on, and selected the gun that was my property - the other two belonged to Wolfe. There were only three cartridges in it, so I pulled the drawer open farther to get to the ammunition compartment and filled the cylinder. as I shoved the gun into the holster I happened to glance at Hackett and saw that he had a new face. The line of his lips was tight, and his eyes looked startled, wary, and concentrated.
"It hadn't occurred to me before," he said, and his voice had changed too. "This Mr. Wolfe is quite an article, and you're his man. I am doing this with the understanding that someone may mistake me for Mr. Wolfe and try to kill me, but I have only his word for it that that is actually the situation. If it's more complicated than that, and the intention is for you to shoot me yourself, I want to say emphatically that that would not be fair."
I grinned at him sympathetically, trying to make up for my blunder, realizing that I should not have dressed for the occasion in his presence. The sight of the gun, a real gun and real cartridges, had scared him stiff. If he ran out on us now and we had to advertise again to find a new one - my God, I had just handed him a hundred bucks!
"Listen," I told him earnestly, "you said a minute ago that you expect nothing to happen. You may be right. I'm inclined to agree with you. But in case somebody does undertake to perform, I am wearing this little number" - I patted under my arm where the gun was - "for two purposes: first, to keep you from getting hurt; and second, if you do get hurt, to hurt him worse."
It seemed to satisfy him, for his eyes got less concentrated, but he didn't resume with the ginger snaps. At least I had accomplished that much. Using a matter-of- fact tone, which I thought would reassure him, I explained that he was to go to

 Wolfe's room at eleven-thirty for instructions, which would include our afternoon outing.
==> To tell the truth, by the time the afternoon was over and I had him back in the house again, a little after five-thirty, I had to maintain a firm hold on such details as ginger snaps and his calling me Archie to keep from admiring him. During that extended expedition we made stops at Brooks Brothers, Rusterman's, the Churchill, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Botanical Gardens, and three or four others. He occupied the rear seat, of course, because Wolfe always did, and the mirror showed me that he sat back comfortably, taking in the sights, a lot more imperturbable than Wolfe himself would have been, since Wolfe disliked motion, detested bumps, and had a settled notion that all the other cars had turned out for the express purpose of colliding with his. <==
When we made one of our stops and Hackett got out to cross the sidewalk, he was okay. He didn't hurry or dodge or jerk or weave, but just walked. In Wolfe's hat and coat and stick, he might even have fooled me. I had to hand it to him, in spite of the fact that the whole show struck me as the biggest bust Wolfe had ever concocted. at night it might be different, but here in broad daylight, and with no discernible evidence that anyone was on our trail, I felt foolish, futile, and fatuous, and still I had to keep alert, covering all directions, with the gun in my hand resting on the seat.
Nothing happened. Not a damn thing. back at the house, I left Hackett in the office and went to the kitchen, where Wolfe was sitting at the big table drinking beer and watching Fritz make tomato juice. His daily routine was of course all shot.
I reported, "They tried to get him from the top of the Palisades with a howitzer, but missed him. He has a little bruise on his left elbow from the revolving door at
Rusterman's, but otherwise unhurt." Wolfe grunted. "How did he behave?" "Okay."
Wolfe grunted again. "After dark we may more reasonably expect results. I repeat what I told you at noon: you will take an active part in the interview with

 moved forward, and Jane retreated again, moving backwards without looking around and nearly tripping on Jensen's feet. Wolfe stopped at the corner of his desk and wiggled a finger at Hackett.
"Take another chair, sir, if you please?"
Hackett sidled out, without a word, and went to the red leather chair. Wolfe leaned over to peer at the hole in the back of his own chair, and then at the hole in the plaster, which I had chiseled to a diameter of four inches, grunted, and got himself seated.
"This," Jensen said, "makes it a farce."
Jane snapped, "I'm going," and headed for the door, but I had been expecting that and with only two steps had her by the arm with a good grip and was prepared to give her the twist if she went thorny on me. Jensen sprang to his feet, with both of his hands fists. Evidently in the brief space of forty-eight hours it had developed to the point where the sight of another man laying hands on his Jane started his adrenaline spurting in torrents. If he had come close enough to make it necessary to slap him with my free hand he might have got blood on his ear too, because I had my gun in that hand.
==> "Stop it!" Wolfe's voice was a whip. It turned us into a group of statuary. "Miss Geer, you may leave shortly, if you still want to, after I have said something. Mr. Jensen, sit down. Mr. Goodwin has a gun and is probably in a temper, and might hurt you. Archie, go to your desk, but be ready to use the gun. One of them is a murderer." <==
"That's a lie!" Jensen was visibly breathing. "And who the hell are you?"
"I introduced myself, sir. That gentleman is my temporary employee. When my life was threatened I hired him to impersonate me. If I had known the worst to be expected was a gash in the ear I could have saved some money and spared myself a vast amount of irritation.
Jane spat at him, "You fat coward!"
He shook his head. "No, Miss Geer. It is no great distinction not to be a coward, but I can claim it. Not cowardice. Conceit. I am insufferably conceited. I was convinced that the person who killed Mr. Jensen would be equally daring, witty, and effective in dealing with me. Should I be killed, I doubted if the murderer

==>  would ever be caught. Should another be killed in my place, I would still be alive to attend to the matter myself. Justified conceit, but still conceit." He turned abruptly to me. "Archie, get Inspector Cramer on the phone." <==
They both started talking at once, with vehemence.
I watched them from a corner of an eye while dialing. Wolfe cut them off.
"If you please! In a moment I shall offer you an alternative: the police or me. Meanwhile Mr. Cramer can help. One of you, of course, is putting all this on; to the other I wish to say that you might as well sit down and resign yourself to some inconvenience and unpleasantness." He glanced at Hackett. "If you want to get away from this uproar, there is your room upstairs ..."
"I think I'll stay here," Hackett declared. "I'm a little interested in this myself, since I nearly got killed."
"Cramer on," I told Wolfe.

"No."
"Good. That's sensible. Miss Geer?"
She wasn't conversing. Wolfe waited patiently for four seconds.
"Shall I phone the police, Miss Geer?"
Her head went from side to side in a negative, the way she had moved toward the door, as if someone or something was doing it for her.
==> Wolfe heaved a sigh. "Archie, take them to the front room and stay there till I send for you. Fritz will answer the bell. I am aware that it will be tiresome, but there's no help for it." <==
VIII
Yes, it got tiresome, lasting as it did a full two hours. at first I got some diversion out of the fact that Jane and Jensen showed no inclination to sit side by side on the sofa and hold hands. God knows where Wolfe had ever found that sofa and the velvet cushions; it had been there when I had first arrived. One or the other of them did sit on it now and again during their restless moving around, but not the two together. Wolfe's poison had done its work. It was interesting to watch it.
The one who had not fired the gun had got suspicious of the other one; and the other one, seeing that, obviously had figured that if he or she tried to be cordial on the basis of what the hell, darling, we couldn't be murderers, could we, it would be a giveaway, because the one would be thinking, If I'm suspicious why isn't he or she?

2. "There's a door to that bathroom from this room too. Over there. The one from the bathroom to the office is now locked."
3. "I beg your pardon." That was for a yawn.
She neither spoke to me nor looked at me. Jensen was about as bad. I don't

 remember any two hours in my experience with a lower score on joviality. So I appreciated the break in the monotony when, a little before nine, I heard the doorbell. Since the door from the front room to the hall was also soundproof, that was all I got out of it except for the faint vibration of footsteps and an even fainter sound of voices. But in about three minutes the door to the hall opened and Fritz came in. He shut the door behind him and spoke, not very loud.
==> "Archie, Mr. Wolfe wants you in the office. Inspector Cramer is there with Sergeant Stebbins. I am to stay here." <==
He held out his hand for the gun. I gave it to him and went.
If the situation in the front room had been unjovial, the one in the office was absolutely grim. One glance at Wolfe was enough to see that he was in a state of uncontrollable fury, because his forefinger was making the same circle, over and over, on the surface of his desk. Sergeant Purley Stebbins was standing by the wall, looking official. Inspector Cramer was in the red leather chair, with his face about the color of the chair.
Nobody bothered to glance at me. Wolfe snapped, "Your notebook."
I crossed to my desk and got book and pencil and sat down. "This," I observed, "is what comes of my not attending to the doorbell. If we didn't want company - "
"Pfui." Wolfe tapped a piece of paper on his desk. "Look at this."

"There were six velvet cushions on that sofa. There are only five. Did you remove it?"
"No, sir." Fritz gazed at the sofa and counted.
"That's right. They've been rearranged to take up the space. I don't understand it. They were all here yesterday when I cleaned in here."
"Are you sure of that?"
"Yes, sir. Positive."
==> "Look for it. Archie, help him. I want to know if that cushion is in this room." <==
It seemed like an odd moment to send out a general alarm for a sofa cushion, but since I had nothing else to do at the moment I obliged. Cramer and Purley went

 on solving a murder and Fritz and I went on hunting the cushion. Jensen watched both operations. Wolfe watched only one - Fritz's and mine. Jane pretended there was no one in the room but her.
I finally told Wolfe, "It's gone. It isn't in here." He muttered at me, "I see it isn't."
I stared at him. There was an expression on his face that I knew well. It wasn't exactly excitement, though it always stirred excitement in me. His neck was rigid, as if to prevent any movement of the head, so as not to disturb the brain, his eyes were half shut and not seeing anything, and his lips were moving, pushing out, then relaxing, then pushing out again. I knew it would take more than the loss of a velvet cushion to produce that effect on him. I stared at him.

==> Suddenly he turned and spoke. "Mr. Cramer! Please leave Mr. Stebbins in here with Miss Geer and Mr. Jensen. You can stay here too, or come with me, as you prefer. Fritz and Archie, come." He headed for the office. Cramer, knowing Wolfe's tones of voice almost as well as I did, spoke to Stebbins and then followed. Fritz and I also followed. So did Jane's voice. <==
"This is outrageous! I want - " I shut the door.
Wolfe waited until he was in his chair before he spoke. "I want to know if that cushion is on the premises. Search the house from the cellar up - except the south room; Mr. Hackett is in there lying down. Start in here." Cramer barked, "What the hell is all this about?"
"I'll give you an explanation," Wolfe told him, "when I have one. I'm going to sit here and work and must not be disturbed. It may take ten minutes; it may take ten hours. Go in there; stay here; go anywhere, but let me alone."
He leaned back and closed his eyes, and his lips started moving. Cramer slid farther back in his chair, crossed his legs, got out a cigar and sank his teeth in it.
Searching the office was quite different from searching the front room. In the first place, it was a lot bigger. Also, there were a lot more places where you could hide a cushion - files, drawers, bookshelves, magazine and newspaper

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 29286    window = 29281 29291


None of them could be ruled out, because the shelves were deep, and it was no trivial job to pull out all those books and slide them back again. Fritz went at it with his usual deliberate thoroughness, and I couldn't have been called a whirlwind either because I was using my brain along with my hands, trying to work out how and why the fact of a missing cushion crashed into the structure like a comet shattering a world. Now and then a glance at Wolfe showed me that he was still working, his lips moving and his eyes shut.
Half an hour or so had passed, maybe a little more, when I heard him let out a grunt. I nearly toppled off the steps, turning to look at him. He was in motion. He picked up his wastebasket, which was kept at the far corner of his desk, held it so that the light shone directly into it, inspected it, shook his head, put it down again, and began opening the drawers of his desk, all the way out, and inspecting their interiors, starting with the top one on the right side. The first two, the one at the top and the one in the middle, apparently didn't get him anything, but when he yanked out the double-depth one at the bottom as far as it would go, he looked in, bent over closer to see better, stuck a hand in and seemed to be poking around, closed the drawer, got himself erect, and announced:
"I've found it."
In those three little words there was at least two tons of self-satisfaction and smirk.
We all goggled at him.
==> He looked at me. "Archie. Get down off that thing and don't fall. Look in your desk and see if one of my guns has been fired." <==
I stepped down and went and opened the armament drawer. The first one I picked up was innocent. I tried the second with a sniff and a look and reported, "Yes, sir. There were six cartridges and now there are five.
Same as the cushions. The shell is here."
"Tchah! The confounded ass! Tell Miss Geer and Mr. Jensen that they may come in here if they care to hear what happened, or they may go home or anywhere else. We don't need them. Take Mr. Stebbins upstairs with you and bring Mr.

 Hackett down here. Use caution and search him with great care. He is an extremely dangerous man and an unsurpassable idiot."

Jensen popped up, "You haven't explained the flummery."
"I shall, Mr. Jensen." Wolfe got more comfortable in his chair. "But first that performance Tuesday evening." He was keeping his eyes on Hackett. "That was a masterpiece. You decided to kill Mr. Jensen first, which was lucky for me, and, since all apartment-house service staffs are short-handed, got a job there as doorman with no difficulty. All you had to do was await an opportunity, with no passers-by or other onlookers. It came the day after you mailed the threat, an ideal situation in every respect except the presence of the man he had hired to guard him. Arriving at the entrance to the apartment house, naturally they would have no suspicion of the doorman in uniform. Mr. Jensen probably nodded and spoke to you. With no one else in sight, and the elevator man ascending with a passenger, it was too good an opportunity to lose. Muffling the revolver with some piece of cloth, you shot Mr. Doyle in the back, and when Mr. Jensen whirled at the sound you shot him in the front and skedaddled for the stairs to the basement and started stoking the water heater. I imagine the first thing you fed it was the cloth with which you had muffled the gun."


Wolfe moved his eyes. "Does that rattle anywhere, Mr. Cramer?" "It sounds tight from here," Cramer conceded.
==> "That's good. Because it is for those murders that Mr. Hackett - or Mr. Root, I suppose I should say - must be convicted. He can't be electrocuted for hacking a little gash in his own ear." Wolfe's eyes moved again, to me. "Archie, did you find any tools in his pockets?" <==
"Only a Boy Scout's dream," I told him. "One of those knives with scissors, awl, nail file ..."
"Let the police have it to look for traces of blood.
Just the sort of thing Mr. Cramer does best." "The comedy can wait," Cramer growled. "I'll take it as is for Tuesday night and go on from there. What about today?"
Wolfe heaved a sigh. "You're rushing past the most interesting point of all: Mr. Hackett's answering my advertisement for a man. Was he sufficiently acute to realize that its specifications were roughly a description of me, suspect that I was the advertiser, and proceed to take advantage of it to approach me? Or was it merely that he was short of funds and attracted by the money offered? I lean to the latter, but I confess I am curious. I don't suppose, Mr. Root, you would care to clear that up for me?"
Mr. Root was not clearing up today.

Nobody seemed to have any irony or derision ready, but Jensen chipped in, "You still haven't explained the flummery."
Wolfe nodded at him. "I'm getting to it, sir. Naturally, from the moment he got in here, Mr. Root was concocting schemes, rejecting, considering, revising; and no doubt relishing the situation enormously. The device of the handkerchief to protect a hand firing a gun was no doubt a part of one of those schemes, but it served admirably for the one he finally used. This morning he learned that Miss Geer was to call on me at six o'clock, and he was to impersonate me. After lunch, in here alone, he got a cushion from the sofa in there, wrapped his revolver in it, and fired a bullet through the back of this chair into the wall. He could, if he wished, have held the thing right against the back of the chair, and probably did. He stuffed the cushion into the rear compartment of the bottom right-hand drawer of this desk, having observed that the contents of the front of the drawer indicated that it was rarely opened.
He put the gun in his pocket. He kept the chair pushed back to the wall to cover the hole in the plaster. The hole in the leather was not conspicuous and he took the risk of its being seen; when he was in the chair he covered the hole with his head."
"If the hole had been seen the bullet would have been found," Cramer muttered.
==> "I have already pronounced him," Wolfe said testily, "an unsurpassable fool. Even so, he knew that Archie would be out with him the rest of the afternoon, and I would be in my room. I had made a remark which informed him that I would not sit in that chair again until he was permanently out of it. At six o'clock Miss Geer arrived, unexpectedly accompanied by Mr. Jensen. They were shown into the front room, and that door was open. Mr. Root's brain moved swiftly, and so did the rest of him. He got one of my guns from Archie's desk, returned to this chair, opened the drawer where he had put the cushion, fired a shot into the cushion, dropped the gun in, and shut the drawer." <==
Wolfe sighed again. "Archie came dashing in, cast a glance at Mr. Root seated here, and went on to the front room. Mr. Root grasped the opportunity to do two things: return my gun to the drawer of Archie's desk, and use a blade of his knife, I would guess the awl, to tear a gash in the corner of his ear. That of course unproved the situation for him. But what improved it vastly more was the chance that came soon after, when Archie took him to the bathroom and left him there. He might have found another chance, but that was perfect.


He entered the front room from the bathroom, put his own gun, handkerchief attached, in the vase, and returned to the bathroom, and later rejoined the others here."
"Jesus!" Purley Stebbins said incredulously. "That guy would jump off the Empire State Building to catch an airplane by the tail."

"No doubt," Wolfe agreed. "I have called him a fool; and yet it was by no means utterly preposterous if I had not noticed the absence of that cushion. Since this desk sits flush with the floor, no sign of the bullet fired into the bottom drawer would be visible unless the drawer was opened, and why should it be? It was unlikely that Archie would have occasion to find that one of my guns in his desk had been fired, and what if he did? Mr. Root knows how to handle a gun without leaving fingerprints, which is simple. Confound it, no. It was entirely feasible for him to await an opportunity to kill me, this evening, tonight, tomorrow morning, with all suspicion aimed at Miss Geer and Mr. Jensen - and disappear." Cramer slowly nodded. "I'm not objecting. I'll buy it. But you must admit you've described quite a few things you can't prove."

"I don't have to. Neither do you. As I said before, Mr. Root will be put on trial for the murder of Mr. Jensen and Mr. Doyle, not for his antics here in my house. And I wish you would take him somewhere else. I've seen enough of him."
"I can't say I blame you," Cramer grinned, which was rare. He stood up. "Let's go, Mr. Root." after letting them out and watching Cramer and Purley manipulating Hackett-Root down the steps to the sidewalk and into the police car, I shut the door without bothering about the bolt and returned to the office. Jane and Jensen were standing side by side in front of Wolfe's desk, just barely not holding hands, beaming down at him.
"... more than neat," Jensen was saying. "It was absolutely brilliant."
"I still can't believe it," Jane declared. "It was wonderful."
"It was merely a job," Wolfe murmured, as if he knew what modesty was.

 father's murder. Later, when the police got the crazy idea that I was involved in it, I was even more anxious to engage you, but still you wouldn't see me, and now of course I understand why. I may not be in debt to you legally, but I am morally, and it will be a great satisfaction to pay it. I haven't my checkbook with me, so I'll have to mail you one - say, five thousand dollars?"
Wolfe shook his head. "I accept pay only from clients, as arranged in advance. If you send me a check I'll have to return it. If you have to send one in order to sleep, send it to the National War Fund."
I managed to keep my face straight. As for Wolfe's renunciation, his income for the year had already reached a point where out of an additional five grand he would have been able to keep about one-fifth. As for Jensen's generosity, if it is okay for males at one age to climb trees and turn somersaults in the presence of females, why isn't it okay for them at another age to wave checkbooks? The way Jane was looking at him reminded me of the way a fifth-grade girl looked at me once, out in Ohio, when I chinned myself fourteen times.
So they settled it on a basis of reciprocal nobility, and the pair turned to go. Not caring to appear churlish, I went to open the front door for them. As they were passing through, Jane suddenly realized I was there and stopped and impulsively extended her hand.
==> "I take it back, Archie. You're not a rat. Shake on it. Is he, Emil?" "He certainly is not," Emil baritoned heartily. <==
"Gee," I stammered with moist eyes, "this is the happiest day of my life. This will make a new rat of me."
I closed the door. back in the office, Wolfe, in his own chair with only one bullet hole that could easily be repaired, and with three bottles of beer on a tray in front of him, was leaning back with his hands resting on the chair arms and his eyes open only to slits, the picture of a man at peace.
He murmured at me, "Archie. Don't forget to remind me in the morning to telephone Mr. Viscardi about that tarragon."
"Yes, sir." I sat down. "And if I may, sir, I would like to offer a suggestion."

What?"
"Only a suggestion. Let's advertise for a man-eating tiger weighing around two hundred and sixty pounds capable off easy and normal movement. We could station him behind the big cabinet and when you enter he would lay on you from the rear."
It didn't faze him. He was enjoying the feel of his chair and I doubt if he heard me.

Jensen got sore, naturally, but Wolfe only murmured at him that he might succeed in interesting the police or that we would be glad to give him a list of reliable detective agencies which would provide companions for his movements as long as he remained alive - at sixty bucks for twenty-four hours. Jensen said that wasn't it, he wanted to hire Wolfe's brains.
Wolfe merely made a face and shook his head. Then Jensen wanted to know what about Goodwin? Wolfe said that Major Goodwin was an officer in the United States Army.
"He's not in uniform," Jensen growled.
Wolfe grunted. "He’ll waste his money. I doubt the urgency of his peril. A man planning a murder doesn't spend his energy clipping pieces out of advertisements of motion pictures."
That was Tuesday. The next morning, Wednesday, the papers headlined the murder of Ben Jensen on the front page. Eating breakfast in the kitchen with Fritz, as usual, I was only halfway through the report in the Times when the doorbell rang, and when I answered it.
==> I found on the stoop our old friend Inspector Cramer of the Homicide Squad. <==
II
Nero Wolfe said, "Not interested, not involved, and not curious."
He was a sight, as he always was when propped up in bed with his breakfast tray. The custom was for Fritz to deliver the tray to his room on the second floor at eight o'clock. It was now eight-fifteen, and already down the gullet were the peaches and cream, most of the unrationed bacon, and two-thirds of the eggs, not to mention coffee and the green tomato jam. The black silk coverlet was folded back, and you had to look to tell where the yellow percale sheet ended and the yellow pajamas began. Few people except Fritz and me ever got to see him like that, but he had stretched a point for Inspector Cramer, who knew that from nine

 to eleven he would be up in the plant rooms with the orchids and unavailable.

Nero Wolfe said, "Not interested, not involved, and not curious."
He was a sight, as he always was when propped up in bed with his breakfast tray. The custom was for Fritz to deliver the tray to his room on the second floor at eight o'clock.

"And I have told you what for," Wolfe said politely. "He had received that threat and said he wanted to hire my brains. I declined to work for him and he went away.
That was all."
"Why did you decline to work for him? What had he done to you?"

"Nothing." Wolfe poured coffee. "I don't do that kind of work. A man whose life is threatened anonymously is either in no danger at all, or his danger is so acute and so ubiquitous that his position is hopeless. My only previous association with Mr. Jensen was in connection with an attempt by an Army captain named Peter Root to sell him inside Army information for political purposes. Together we got the necessary evidence and Captain Root was court-martialed. Mr. Jensen was impressed, so he said, by my handling of that case. I suppose that was why he came to me when he wanted help."
"Did he think the threat came from someone connected with Captain Root?"

==> "No. Root wasn't mentioned. He said he had no idea who intended to kill him." Cramer humphed. "That's what he told Tim Cornwall too. Cornwall thinks you passed because you knew or suspected it was too hot to handle. Naturally Cornwall is bitter. He has lost his best man." <==
"Indeed," Wolfe said mildly. "If that was his best man ..."

So Cornwall says," Cramer insisted, "and he's dead. Name of Doyle, been in the game twenty years, with a good record. The picture as we've got it doesn't necessarily condemn him. Jensen went to Cornwall and Mayor yesterday about noon, and Cornwall assigned Doyle as a guard. We've traced all their movements - nothing special. In the evening Doyle went along to a meeting at a midtown club. They left the dub at eleven-twenty, and apparently went straight home, on the subway or a bus, to the apartment house where Jensen lived on Seventy-third Street near Madison. It was eleven-forty-five when they were found dead on the sidewalk at the entrance to the apartment house. Both shot in the heart with a thirty-eight, Doyle from behind and Jensen from the front. We have the bullets. No powder marks. No nothing."
Wolfe murmured sarcastically, putting down his coffee cup and indicating that since I was there I might as well remove the tray, "Mr. Cornwall's best man."
"Nuts," Cramer objected to the sarcasm. "He was shot in the back. There's a narrow passage ten paces away where the guy could have hid. Or the shots could have come from a passing car, or from across the street - though that would have taken some shooting, two right in the pump. We haven't found nobody who heard the shots. The doorman was in the basement stoking the water heater, the excuse for that being that they're short of men like everybody else. The elevator man was on his way to the tenth floor within passenger, a tenant. The bodies were discovered by two women on their way home from a movie. It must have happened not more than a minute before they came by, but they had just got off a Madison Avenue bus at the corner."

Wolfe got out of bed, which was an operation deserving an audience. He glanced at the clock on the bed table. It was eight-thirty-five.
"I know, I know," Cramer growled. "You've got to get dressed and get upstairs to your goddam horticulture. The tenant going up in the elevator was a prominent doctor who barely knew Jensen by sight. The two women who found the bodies are Seventh Avenue models who never heard of Jensen. The elevator man has worked there over twenty years without displaying a grudge, and Jensen was a generous tipper and popular with the bunch. The doorman is a fat nitwit who was hired two weeks ago only because of the manpower situation and doesn't know the tenants by name. Beyond those, all we have is the population of New York city and the guests who arrive and depart daily and nightly. That's why I came to you, and for God's sake, give me what you've got. You can see I need it."

Two minutes later, downstairs, as I opened the front door for Inspector Cramer's exit, he turned to me with his cigar tilted up from the corner of his mouth to about a quarter to one and observed, "One thing about that black silk bed cover, it can be used for his shroud when the time comes. Let me know, and I'll come and help sew on it."
I eyed him coldly. "You scold us when we lie, and you scold us when we tell the truth. What does the city pay you for anyhow?" back in the office there was the morning mail, which had been ignored on account of the interruption of the early visitor. I got busy with the opener. There was the usual collection of circulars, catalogues, appeals, requests for advice without enclosed check, and other items, fully up to the pre-war standard, and I was getting toward the bottom of the stack without encountering anything startling or promising when I slit another envelope and there it was.

I stared at it. I picked up the envelope and stared at that. I don't often talk to myself, but I said loud enough for me to hear, "My goodness." Then I left the rest of the mail for later and went and mounted the three flights to the plant rooms on the roof. Proceeding through the first three departments, past everything from rows of generating flasks to Cattleya hybrids covered with blooms, I found Wolfe in the potting room, with Theodore Horstmann, the orchid nurse, examining a crate of sphagnum that had just arrived.
"Well?" he demanded with no sign of friendliness.
The general idea was that when he was up there I interrupted him at my peril.

"I suppose," I said carelessly, "that I shouldn't have bothered you, but I ran across something in the mail that I thought you'd find amusing," and I put them on the bench before him, side by side: the envelope with his name and address printed on it by hand, in ink, and the piece of paper that had been clipped from something with scissors or a sharp knife, reading in large black script, printed but not by hand:

"I know it. Is he there? Also, what about that young woman, his fiancee, who raised such a ruction about it and called me a mongrel bloodhound? A

 contradiction in terms - not a good epithet. Her name is Jane Geer."
Wolfe's eyes half opened for an instant. "You have a habit of knowing how to locate personable young women without delay. Have you seen that one recently?"
"Oh," I said offhand, "I sort of struck up an acquaintance with her. I guess I can get in touch with her. But I doubt - "
==> "Do so. I want to see her. Excuse me for interrupting, but you have a train to catch. Also inform Inspector Cramer of this development and suggest that he investigate captain Root's background - his relatives and intimates - anyone besides Miss Geer who might thirst for vengeance at his disgrace. I'll do that. If Captain Root is in prison, arrange with General Fife to bring him here. I want to have a talk with him. Where is the clipping received yesterday by Mr. Jensen? Ask Mr. Cornwall and Mr. Cramer. There is the possibility that this is not another one like it, but the same one." <==
I shook my head. "No, sir. This one is clipped closer to the printing at the upper right."
"I noticed that, but ask anyway. Inspect the chain bolts on the doors and test the night gong in your room.
Fritz will sleep in your room tonight. I shall speak to Fritz and Theodore. All of this can easily be attended to by telephone except Miss Geer, and that is your problem. Do not for the present mention her to Mr. Cramer. I want to see her before he does. When will you return from Washington?"
'I should be able to catch a noon train back - my appointment's at nine. Getting here around five." I added earnestly, "If I can clear it with Carpenter to cross the ocean, I will of course arrange not to leave until this ad-clipper has been attended to. I wouldn't want - "
"Don't hurry back on my account. Or alter your plans. You receive a salary from the government."

Wolfe's tone was dry, sharp, and icy, plainly intended to pierce all my vital organs at once. He went on with it, "Please get General Fife on the phone. We'll begin by learning about Captain Root."

The program went smoothly, all except the Jane Geer number. If it hadn't been for her I'd have been able to make the six o'clock train with hours to spare.

==> Fife reported back on Root in thirty minutes, to the effect that Root was in the clink on government property down in Maryland and would be transported to New York without delay for an interview with Wolfe, which appeared to contradict the saying that democracies are always ungrateful. Cornwall said he had turned the clipping and envelope Jensen had received over to Inspector Cramer, and Cramer verified it and said he had it. But Cramer seemed to be too busy for an extended phone conversation, and I understood why when, shortly after we had finished lunch, he arrived at our place in person, sat down in the red leather chair and narrowed his eyes at Wolfe, emitted a hoarse, grating chuckle and said offensively: <==
"Interested, involved, and curious."
Naturally Wolfe tossed it back at him, but after three minutes of fast and hot tongue work they patched it up and discussed matters. Cramer had the Jensen clipping with him, and they compared the two and found they were from copies of the same magazine, a piece of information which I would have considered no bargain at a nickel. We emptied the bag on the Captain Root episode, all but the Jane Geer item, and Cramer said he would do a survey of Root's history and connections. as for the official investigation of the Jensen murder, they still had the entire population of the metropolitan area for suspects, which gave them plenty of room to move around in. When Cramer's recital made it evident that the squad had got nowhere at all, Wolfe saw fit to make a couple of cracks and Cramer returned the compliment, so the conference ended on the same breezy note it had begun with.
On Jane Geer the luck was low. When before noon I phoned the advertising agency she worked for I was told that she was somewhere in Long Island admiring some client's product for which she was to produce copy. When I finally did get her, after four o'clock, she went willful on me, presumably because she regarded my phoning five times in one day as evidence that my primal impulses had been aroused and I was beginning to pant. She would not come to Nero Wolfe's place unless I went after her and bought her a cocktail first.
So I met her a little after five at the Calico Room at the Churchill, and bought.

Wolfe's tone was dry, sharp, and icy, plainly intended to pierce all my vital organs at once. He went on with it, "Please get General Fife on the phone. We'll begin by learning about Captain Root."

The program went smoothly, all except the Jane Geer number. If it hadn't been for her I'd have been able to make the six o'clock train with hours to spare.
Fife reported back on Root in thirty minutes, to the effect that Root was in the clink on government property down in Maryland and would be transported to New York without delay for an interview with Wolfe, which appeared to contradict the saying that democracies are always ungrateful. Cornwall said he had turned the clipping and envelope Jensen had received over to Inspector Cramer, and Cramer verified it and said he had it. But Cramer seemed to be too busy for an extended phone conversation, and I understood why when, shortly after we had finished lunch, he arrived at our place in person, sat down in the red leather chair and narrowed his eyes at Wolfe, emitted a hoarse, grating chuckle and said offensively:
"Interested, involved, and curious."
==> Naturally Wolfe tossed it back at him, but after three minutes of fast and hot tongue work they patched it up and discussed matters. Cramer had the Jensen clipping with him, and they compared the two and found they were from copies of the same magazine, a piece of information which I would have considered no bargain at a nickel. We emptied the bag on the Captain Root episode, all but the Jane Geer item, and Cramer said he would do a survey of Root's history and connections. as for the official investigation of the Jensen murder, they still had the entire population of the metropolitan area for suspects, which gave them plenty of room to move around in. When Cramer's recital made it evident that the squad had got nowhere at all, Wolfe saw fit to make a couple of cracks and Cramer returned the compliment, so the conference ended on the same breezy note it had begun with. <==

She had put in a full day's work, but looking at her you might have thought she had come straight from an afternoon nap and a relaxing bath.

Fritz, who had been with Wolfe even longer than me, had his own ideas about certain details. When he answered the phone in the daytime between nine and five he said, "Mr. Nero Wolfe's office." At any other time he said, "Mr. Nero Wolfe's residence."
"Hello, Fritz. Archie. Calling from Washington. Where's Mr. Wolfe?"
"He's in bed. He had a hard day. And evening."
"Doing what?"
==> "He was very busy on the telephone. Also some callers. Mr. Cramer. And he had that stenographer from that place." <==
"Oh. He did. Using my typewriter. Do you happen to know whether he looked at the Star today?"
"The Star?' Fritz hesitated. "Not that I know of. He never does. There is only my copy, and it's in the kitchen."
"Get it, and look at an ad, a small one in a box, near the lower right corner on page eleven. Read it. I'll hold the wire."
I sat and waited. Before long he was back on.
"I read it." He sounded puzzled. "Are you calling clear from Washington to make a joke?"

"Archie." His tone was sharp. "Do you think I enjoy this idiotic horseplay?"
"No, sir. But why couldn't you just stay in the house? You do anyway. I've known you to not stick your nose out for a month. And be careful who gets in.
Until ..."
"Until what?"
"Until the bird that killed Jensen is caught."
==> "Bah." He glared at me. "By whom? By Mr. Cramer? What do you suppose he is doing now? Pfui. Major Jensen, Mr. Jensen's son, arriving home on leave from Europe five days ago, learned that during his absence his father had sued his mother for divorce. The father and son quarreled, which was not unique. But Mr. Cramer has a hundred men trying to collect evidence that will convict Major Jensen of killing his father! Utterly intolerable asininity. For what motive could Major Jensen have for killing me, or threatening to?" <==

Well, now." My eyebrows were up. "I wouldn't just toss it in the wastebasket. What if the major figured that sending you the same kind of message he sent his father would make everybody react the way you are?"
Wolfe shook his head. "He didn't. Unless he's a born fool. He would have known that merely sending me that thing would be inadequate, that he would have to follow it up by making good on the threat; and he hasn't killed me and I doubt if he intends to. General Fife has looked up his record for me. Mr. Cramer is wasting his time, his men's energy, and the money of the people of New York. I am handicapped. The men I have used and can trust have gone to war. You bounce around thinking only of yourself, deserting me. I am confined to this room, left to my own devices, with a vindictive bloodthirsty maniac waiting for an opportunity to murder me. I have no hint of his identity and no sniff of his scent."
He sure was piling it on. But I knew better than to contribute a note of skepticism when he was in one of his romantic moods, having been fired for that once, and besides, I wouldn't have signed an affidavit that he was exaggerating the situation. So I only asked him, "What about Captain Peter Root? Did they bring him?"
"Yes. He was here today and I talked with him. He has been in that prison for over a month and asserts that this cannot possibly be connected with him or his. He says Miss Geer has not communicated with him for six weeks or more. His mother is teaching school at Danforth, Ohio; that has been verified by Mr. Cramer; she is there. His father, who formerly ran a filling station at Danforth, abandoned wife and son ten years ago, and is said to be working in a war plant in Oklahoma. Wife and son prefer not to discuss him. No brother or sister. According to Captain Root, no one on earth who would conceivably undertake a ride on the subway, let alone multiple murder, to avenge him."

I'm surprised that I was able to speak at all. He had of course insulted me a million times, as I had him, but this was worse than an insult, there was no word for it. coming on top of the turndown I had got in Washington, which had reduced my buoyancy to a record low, it made me so mad that I knew I'd better get out of there. but I did not intend to let him go to bed feeling noble, so I grinned at him and controlled my voice.
"Okay," I told him. "I'll think it over. Sure, Cramer has a lot of good men. Let you know in the morning. I'll remember to turn the gong on."
I went up to my room.
The gong was a dingus under my bed. The custom was that when I retired at night I turned a switch, and if anyone put his foot down in the hall within ten feet of Wolfe's door the gong gonged. It had been installed on account of a certain occurrence some years previously, when Wolfe had got a knife stuck in him. The thing had never gone off except when we tested it, and in my opinion never would, but I never failed to switch it on because if Wolfe had stepped into the hall some night and the gong hadn't sounded it would have caused discussion.
This night, with a stranger in the house, I was glad it was there. I learned from Fritz that H. H. Hackett was sleeping in the south room, on the same floor as me, and on the basis of my brief acquaintance and my one look at him it wouldn't have surprised me if he had undertaken to sneak into Wolfe's room during the night and kill him, dispose of the body down in the furnace, and expect Fritz and me to take him for Wolfe and never catch on. Women and girls of appropriate age and configuration may call me Archie and welcome. With the rest of my fellow beings I am particular.

In the morning, breakfast was all over the place, with Wolfe in his room, Hackett in the dining-room, and me in the kitchen with Fritz. Afterwards I spent an hour up in the plant rooms with Wolfe, on the matters we usually attended to in the office, together with consideration of the current problem. Wolfe asked if I had decided whether we should get a chauffeur for Hackett from the Homicide Squad.
==> I looked judicious. "I have," I told him, "thought it over from all angles. Unquestionably Cramer could give us a man who would be my superior in courage, wit, integrity, reflex time, and purity of morals. But here's the trouble— not one anything like as handsome as me. Not a chance. So I'll do it myself." <==
Wolfe cocked an eye at me. "I meant no offense. My intentions—"
"Forget it. You're under a strain. Mr. Hackett's life is in jeopardy and it makes you nervous."
We got to details. Jane Geer was making a nuisance of herself. I understood now, of course, why Wolfe had refused to see her Wednesday evening. After sending me to get her he had conceived the strategy of hiring a double, and he didn't want her to get a look at the real Nero Wolfe because if she did she would be less likely to be deceived by the counterfeit and go to work on him. That meant she was seriously on his list, but I didn't take the trouble to inform him that in my opinion he could cross her off, since he would only have grunted.
She had phoned several times, insisting on seeing him, and had come to the house Friday morning and argued for five minutes with Fritz through the three- inch crack which the chain bolt permitted the door to open to. Now Wolfe had an idea for one of his elaborate charades. I was to phone her to come to see Wolfe at six o'clock that afternoon. When she came I was to take her in to Hackett. Wolfe would coach Hackett for the interview.
I looked skeptical. Wolfe said, "It will give her a chance to kill Mr. Hackett." I snorted. "With me right there to tell her when to cease firing!"

"Possibly not. Also, it will give me an opportunity to see her and tiear her. I shall be at the hole."
So that was really the idea. He would be in the passage, a start of an alcove, at the kitchen end of the downstairs hall, looking through into the office by means of the square hole in the wall. The hole was camouflaged on the office side by a picture that was transparent one way. He loved to have an excuse to use it, and it actually had been a help now and then.
"That's different," I told him. "If you see her and hear her you'll know she has a heart of platinum."
==> Major Jensen had phoned once and been told that Wolfe was engaged; apparently he wasn't as persistent as Jane. He be told Cramer that he had come to see Wolfe on Wednesday because on Tuesday morning his father had shown him the threat he had received in the mail and had announced that he was going to consult <==
Nero Wolfe about it; and the major, wishing his father's murderer to be caught and punished, had wanted to talk with Wolfe. It was Wolfe's veto of my suggestion that Major Jensen be invited to call, not on Hackett but on Wolfe himself, that showed me the state he was in.
Ordinarily it would have needed no suggestion from me, since the major, in his present situation, was a natural for a fat fee.
When I got down to the office Hackett was there in Wolfe's chair, eating cookies and getting crumbs on the desk. I had told him good morning previously, and having nothing else to tell him, ignored him. From the phone on my desk I got Jane Geer at her office.
"Archie," I told her.
She snapped, "Archie who?"

"That's a lie!" Jensen was visibly breathing. "And who the hell are you?"
"I introduced myself, sir. That gentleman is my temporary employee. When my life was threatened I hired him to impersonate me. If I had known the worst to be expected was a gash in the ear I could have saved some money and spared myself a vast amount of irritation.
Jane spat at him, "You fat coward!"
He shook his head. "No, Miss Geer. It is no great distinction not to be a coward, but I can claim it. Not cowardice. Conceit. I am insufferably conceited. I was convinced that the person who killed Mr. Jensen would be equally daring, witty, and effective in dealing with me. Should I be killed, I doubted if the murderer

==>  would ever be caught. Should another be killed in my place, I would still be alive to attend to the matter myself. Justified conceit, but still conceit." He turned abruptly to me. "Archie, get Inspector Cramer on the phone." <==
They both started talking at once, with vehemence.
I watched them from a corner of an eye while dialing. Wolfe cut them off.
"If you please! In a moment I shall offer you an alternative: the police or me. Meanwhile Mr. Cramer can help. One of you, of course, is putting all this on; to the other I wish to say that you might as well sit down and resign yourself to some inconvenience and unpleasantness." He glanced at Hackett. "If you want to get away from this uproar, there is your room upstairs ..."
"I think I'll stay here," Hackett declared. "I'm a little interested in this myself, since I nearly got killed."
"Cramer on," I told Wolfe.

First, examine the revolver for fingerprints and send me copies. Second, trace the revolver if possible. Third, fire a bullet from it and compare it both with the bullet
I am sending you and with the bullets that killed Mr. Jensen and Mr. Doyle. Let me know the results. That's all. No. Confound it, no! If you come yourself you will be handed the package at the door and not admitted. I'm busy." as he hung up I said, "The number has been filed off of the gun."
"Then it can't be traced."

 mark or any other mark and was a species that could be bought in at least a thousand stores in New York City alone, not to mention the rest of the country.
"We'll keep the handkerchief," Wolfe said.
Jensen demanded, "What the devil is it doing there?"

"I still say," Jensen still said, "that it's a damned farce."
"Even so, sir, you're one of the cast. Surely it is risking little to tell me where - "
"I was in the doorway to the hall, looking down the hall and wondering where Goodwin had gone to. For no particular reason. I was not at that precise moment looking at Miss Geer. But I regard it as - "
"That won't help me any. How you regard it. And I doubt if it will help you." Wolfe poured beer, which Fritz had brought. "Now we are ready to decide something."
==> He took them both in. "Miss Geer, you said you wanted to go to a lawyer, heaven protect you. But it would not be sensible to permit either of you to walk out of here, to move and act at your own will and discretion. Since that bullet was intended for me, I reject the notion utterly. On the other hand, we can't proceed intelligently until I get a report from Mr. Cramer. There is time to be passed. You can - " <==
Jane got up. "I'm going."
"One moment. You can either pass it here, in company with Mr. Goodwin and his gun, or I can phone Mr. Cramer, giving him an outline of the situation, and he can send men to get you. Which do you prefer?"
Jane was doing slow motion toward the door. She didn't exactly take a step; it was more as if something was pulling her that way without her doing anything about it. I called to her without leaving my chair, "Listen, honey, I wouldn't shoot you for a nickel, but I can easy catch you before you get out the front door and this time I'll wrap you up good."
She flung it at me: "Rat!"
Jensen was paying no attention to us. His eyes stuck to Wolfe. He asked, not with any venom, just asking, "Which do you prefer?" Evidently he had decided to give us an exhibition of self-control.

Wolfe returned his gaze. "I should think," he said dryly, "that you would rather stay here. As you probably know, Mr. Cramer is not fond of you, and he is somewhat heavy-handed. Not that he can be kept out of it indefinitely, but the

Jensen said, "I want to use the phone."
Wolfe shook his head. "No, sir. Shall I call Mr. Cramer?"
"No."

"Good. That's sensible. Miss Geer?"
She wasn't conversing. Wolfe waited patiently for four seconds.
"Shall I phone the police, Miss Geer?"
Her head went from side to side in a negative, the way she had moved toward the door, as if someone or something was doing it for her.

2. "There's a door to that bathroom from this room too. Over there. The one from the bathroom to the office is now locked."
3. "I beg your pardon." That was for a yawn.
She neither spoke to me nor looked at me. Jensen was about as bad. I don't

 remember any two hours in my experience with a lower score on joviality. So I appreciated the break in the monotony when, a little before nine, I heard the doorbell. Since the door from the front room to the hall was also soundproof, that was all I got out of it except for the faint vibration of footsteps and an even fainter sound of voices. But in about three minutes the door to the hall opened and Fritz came in. He shut the door behind him and spoke, not very loud.
==> "Archie, Mr. Wolfe wants you in the office. Inspector Cramer is there with Sergeant Stebbins. I am to stay here." <==
He held out his hand for the gun. I gave it to him and went.
If the situation in the front room had been unjovial, the one in the office was absolutely grim. One glance at Wolfe was enough to see that he was in a state of uncontrollable fury, because his forefinger was making the same circle, over and over, on the surface of his desk. Sergeant Purley Stebbins was standing by the wall, looking official. Inspector Cramer was in the red leather chair, with his face about the color of the chair.
Nobody bothered to glance at me. Wolfe snapped, "Your notebook."
I crossed to my desk and got book and pencil and sat down. "This," I observed, "is what comes of my not attending to the doorbell. If we didn't want company - "
"Pfui." Wolfe tapped a piece of paper on his desk. "Look at this."

I arose and looked. It was a search warrant. "The premises ... owned and inhabited by said Nero Wolfe ... situate ..."
Wowie. I was surprised that Cramer was still alive, or Wolfe either. Cramer growled, holding himself in, "I'll try to forget what you just said, Wolfe. It was totally uncalled for. Goddam it, you have given me a runaround too many times. There I was, with that gun. A bullet fired from it matched the bullet you sent me and also the two that killed Jensen and Doyle.

Wolfe had started making the circle again. "I repeat, sir," he murmured, "that your acceptance of your salary constitutes a fraud on the people of New York and you are a disgrace to an honorable profession."
Cramer’s face had reached the red of the chair and was going on from there. "Then," he said, "I won't try to forget it. We're going to search this house." He started to leave the chair.
"If you do you'll never catch the murderer of Mr. Jensen and Mr. Doyle." Cramer dropped back in the chair. "I won't? You'll prevent me?"

A grunt came from Purley Stebbins, but no one noticed it but me. I grinned at him. Cramer said, "The hell you have."
"Yes, sir. Your report on the gun and bullets settles it. But I confess the matter is a little complicated, and I do give you a formal warning: you are not equipped to handle it. I am." Wolfe shoved the warrant across the desk. "Tear that thing up."
Cramer slowly shook his head. "You see, Wolfe, I know you. God, don't I know you! But I'm willing to have a talk before I execute it."

"I wish," Cramer growled, gazing at him as if he were looking at a puzzle he had seen and worked at many times but had never got solved, "I wish I knew how much dressing you put on that."
"Not any. I have only one concern in this. I have no client. I withheld nothing and added nothing."
"Maybe." Cramer straightened up like a man of action. "Okay, we'll proceed on that basis and find out. First of all, I want to ask them some questions."
"I suppose you do." Wolfe detested sitting and listening to someone else ask questions, especially in his own office. "And Miss Geer is going to be difficult. She wants a lawyer. You are handicapped, of course, by your official status. Which one do you want first?"
Cramer stood up. "I've got to see that room before I talk to either of them. I want to see where things are. Especially that vase."

==> "I wish," Cramer growled, gazing at him as if he were looking at a puzzle he had seen and worked at many times but had never got solved, "I wish I knew how much dressing you put on that." <==
"Not any. I have only one concern in this. I have no client. I withheld nothing and added nothing."
"Maybe." Cramer straightened up like a man of action. "Okay, we'll proceed on that basis and find out. First of all, I want to ask them some questions."
"I suppose you do." Wolfe detested sitting and listening to someone else ask questions, especially in his own office. "And Miss Geer is going to be difficult. She wants a lawyer. You are handicapped, of course, by your official status. Which one do you want first?"
Cramer stood up. "I've got to see that room before I talk to either of them. I want to see where things are. Especially that vase."
I was amazed to see that Wolfe was leaving his chair too, knowing his attitude toward all nonessential movement, but as I went to open the door to the front room for them I reflected that while he hated hearing Cramer ask questions, under the circumstances he would hate even more not hearing him, in case conversation got started in the front room. Stebbins tagged in after them, and I brought up the rear.

Jane was seated on the piano bench. Jensen was on the sofa, but arose as we entered. Fritz was standing by a window, his hand with the gun coming up as Jensen moved.
Wolfe said, "This is Inspector Cramer, Miss Geer."

"Yes, I have." Jensen's voice had gone unused so long it squeaked, and he cleared his throat. "So the agreement not to call in the police was a farce too." He was bitter.

"I insist," Jane put in, in a voice with no resemblance to any I had ever heard her use before, "on my right to consult a lawyer."
"Just a minute now," Cramer told her in the tone he thought was soothing. "We're going to talk this over, but wait till I look around a little." He proceeded to inspect things, and so did Sergeant Stebbins. They considered distances, and the positions of various objects. Then there was this detail: from what segment of that room could a gun send a bullet through the open door to the office and on through the hole in Wolfe's chair and the one in the wall?
They were working on that together when Wolfe turned to Fritz and asked him, "What happened to the other cushion?"
Fritz was taken aback. "Other cushion?"
"There were six velvet cushions on that sofa. There are only five. Did you remove it?"

"No, sir." Fritz gazed at the sofa and counted.
"That's right. They've been rearranged to take up the space. I don't understand it. They were all here yesterday when I cleaned in here."

"Are you sure of that?"
"Yes, sir. Positive."
"Look for it. Archie, help him. I want to know if that cushion is in this room."
==> It seemed like an odd moment to send out a general alarm for a sofa cushion, but since I had nothing else to do at the moment I obliged. Cramer and Purley went <==

 on solving a murder and Fritz and I went on hunting the cushion. Jensen watched both operations. Wolfe watched only one - Fritz's and mine. Jane pretended there was no one in the room but her.
I finally told Wolfe, "It's gone. It isn't in here." He muttered at me, "I see it isn't."
I stared at him. There was an expression on his face that I knew well. It wasn't exactly excitement, though it always stirred excitement in me. His neck was rigid, as if to prevent any movement of the head, so as not to disturb the brain, his eyes were half shut and not seeing anything, and his lips were moving, pushing out, then relaxing, then pushing out again. I knew it would take more than the loss of a velvet cushion to produce that effect on him. I stared at him.
Suddenly he turned and spoke. "Mr. Cramer! Please leave Mr. Stebbins in here with Miss Geer and Mr. Jensen. You can stay here too, or come with me, as you prefer. Fritz and Archie, come." He headed for the office. Cramer, knowing Wolfe's tones of voice almost as well as I did, spoke to Stebbins and then followed. Fritz and I also followed. So did Jane's voice.

"This is outrageous! I want - " I shut the door.
Wolfe waited until he was in his chair before he spoke. "I want to know if that cushion is on the premises. Search the house from the cellar up - except the south room; Mr. Hackett is in there lying down. Start in here." Cramer barked, "What the hell is all this about?"
"I'll give you an explanation," Wolfe told him, "when I have one. I'm going to sit here and work and must not be disturbed. It may take ten minutes; it may take ten hours. Go in there; stay here; go anywhere, but let me alone."
He leaned back and closed his eyes, and his lips started moving. Cramer slid farther back in his chair, crossed his legs, got out a cigar and sank his teeth in it.
Searching the office was quite different from searching the front room. In the first place, it was a lot bigger. Also, there were a lot more places where you could hide a cushion - files, drawers, bookshelves, magazine and newspaper

 racks, cabinets, miscellaneous. It had a high ceiling, and the steps had to be used for all the upper shelves and file and cabinet compartments.
None of them could be ruled out, because the shelves were deep, and it was no trivial job to pull out all those books and slide them back again. Fritz went at it with his usual deliberate thoroughness, and I couldn't have been called a whirlwind either because I was using my brain along with my hands, trying to work out how and why the fact of a missing cushion crashed into the structure like a comet shattering a world. Now and then a glance at Wolfe showed me that he was still working, his lips moving and his eyes shut.
Half an hour or so had passed, maybe a little more, when I heard him let out a grunt. I nearly toppled off the steps, turning to look at him. He was in motion. He picked up his wastebasket, which was kept at the far corner of his desk, held it so that the light shone directly into it, inspected it, shook his head, put it down again, and began opening the drawers of his desk, all the way out, and inspecting their interiors, starting with the top one on the right side. The first two, the one at the top and the one in the middle, apparently didn't get him anything, but when he yanked out the double-depth one at the bottom as far as it would go, he looked in, bent over closer to see better, stuck a hand in and seemed to be poking around, closed the drawer, got himself erect, and announced:

They stood facing each other, with Jensen's right hand on Jane's left shoulder, and Jane's right hand, or perhaps just the fingers, on Jensen's left forearm. I left it to them to find the way to the office alone, told Purley Stebbins what our job was, and took him upstairs with me to the south room.
It was approximately ten minutes later that we delivered our cargo in the office. Even though Mr. Hackett staged one of the most convincing demonstrations of unwillingness to co-operate that I have ever encountered, beginning the instant I put a hand on him to frisk him, only about six of the ten minutes were devoted to persuading him that there were worse things than going downstairs. For the other four minutes I sat on him, examining my shin to see if his kicks had busted the skin and testing my wrist to decide if it was sprained, while Purley was in the bathroom washing blood off his cheek and neck and applying BandAids.


Not that Hackett had confined himself to kicking and scratching; he hadn't confined himself at all. Purley and I did the confining.
==> We got him to the office in one piece, nothing really wrong with him but a few bruises, and put him in a chair. Purley took an upright position right behind him, with the evident intention of standing by, so I went to my desk. Jane and Jensen were on a couple of chairs side by side, over near the big globe. Cramer was as before. <==
I said, "He was reluctant."
I'll say one thing for Wolfe, I've never seen him gloat over a guy about to get it. He was contemplating Hackett more as an extraordinary object that deserved study.
I said, "Purley thinks he knows him."
Purley, as was proper, spoke to his superior. "I swear, Inspector, I'm sure I've seen him somewhere, but I can't remember."
Wolfe nodded. "A uniform makes a difference. I suggest that he was in uniform."

"Uniform?" Purley scowled. "Army?"
==> Wolfe shook his head. "Mr. Cramer told me Wednesday morning that the doorman on duty at the apartment house at the time Mr. Jensen and Mr. Doyle were killed was a fat nitwit who had been hired two weeks ago and didn't know the tenants by name, and also that he claimed to have been in the basement stoking the water heater at the moment the murders were committed. A phone call would tell us whether he is still working there." <==
"He isn't," Cramer growled. "He left Wednesday afternoon because he didn't like a place where people got murdered. I never saw him. Some of my men did."
"Yeah," Purley said, gazing at Hackett's face. "By God, it's him. I thought he didn't have brains enough to know which end to pick up a shovel."
"He is," Wolfe declared, "a remarkable combination of fool and genius. He came to New York determined to kill Mr. Jensen and me. By the way, Mr. Hackett,

 you look a little dazed. Can you hear what I'm saying?"

Wolfe nodded. "I know. One more day and you would have killed me, with the suspicion centered on Miss Geer or Mr. Jensen, or both, on account of your flummery here this afternoon. And you would have disappeared, probably after again complaining that you don't like a place where people get murdered."
Jensen popped up, "You haven't explained the flummery."
"I shall, Mr. Jensen." Wolfe got more comfortable in his chair. "But first that performance Tuesday evening." He was keeping his eyes on Hackett. "That was a masterpiece. You decided to kill Mr. Jensen first, which was lucky for me, and, since all apartment-house service staffs are short-handed, got a job there as doorman with no difficulty. All you had to do was await an opportunity, with no passers-by or other onlookers. It came the day after you mailed the threat, an ideal situation in every respect except the presence of the man he had hired to guard him. Arriving at the entrance to the apartment house, naturally they would have no suspicion of the doorman in uniform. Mr. Jensen probably nodded and spoke to you. With no one else in sight, and the elevator man ascending with a passenger, it was too good an opportunity to lose. Muffling the revolver with some piece of cloth, you shot Mr. Doyle in the back, and when Mr. Jensen whirled at the sound you shot him in the front and skedaddled for the stairs to the basement and started stoking the water heater. I imagine the first thing you fed it was the cloth with which you had muffled the gun."


==> Wolfe moved his eyes. "Does that rattle anywhere, Mr. Cramer?" "It sounds tight from here," Cramer conceded. <==
"That's good. Because it is for those murders that Mr. Hackett - or Mr. Root, I suppose I should say - must be convicted. He can't be electrocuted for hacking a little gash in his own ear." Wolfe's eyes moved again, to me. "Archie, did you find any tools in his pockets?"
"Only a Boy Scout's dream," I told him. "One of those knives with scissors, awl, nail file ..."
"Let the police have it to look for traces of blood.
Just the sort of thing Mr. Cramer does best." "The comedy can wait," Cramer growled. "I'll take it as is for Tuesday night and go on from there. What about today?"
Wolfe heaved a sigh. "You're rushing past the most interesting point of all: Mr. Hackett's answering my advertisement for a man. Was he sufficiently acute to realize that its specifications were roughly a description of me, suspect that I was the advertiser, and proceed to take advantage of it to approach me? Or was it merely that he was short of funds and attracted by the money offered? I lean to the latter, but I confess I am curious. I don't suppose, Mr. Root, you would care to clear that up for me?"

Was he sufficiently acute to realize that its specifications were roughly a description of me, suspect that I was the advertiser, and proceed to take advantage of it to approach me? Or was it merely that he was short of funds and attracted by the money offered? I lean to the latter, but I confess I am curious. I don't suppose, Mr. Root, you would care to clear that up for me?"
Mr. Root was not clearing up today.
"Very well. I can offer no inducement. In any event, having answered the advertisement and received a message from me, you were of course delighted, and doubly delighted when you were hired." Wolfe's eyes described an arc, including everybody in the roundup.
"I invite comment, anything from irony to derision, on the fact that I paid a hundred dollars a day, to get him to live in my house, eat my food, and sit in my chair, to a man who had resolved to kill me. I can afford the invitation only because, in spite of that overwhelming handicap, I shall go on living and he will not."

"I invite comment, anything from irony to derision, on the fact that I paid a hundred dollars a day, to get him to live in my house, eat my food, and sit in my chair, to a man who had resolved to kill me. I can afford the invitation only because, in spite of that overwhelming handicap, I shall go on living and he will not."

Nobody seemed to have any irony or derision ready, but Jensen chipped in, "You still haven't explained the flummery."
Wolfe nodded at him. "I'm getting to it, sir. Naturally, from the moment he got in here, Mr. Root was concocting schemes, rejecting, considering, revising; and no doubt relishing the situation enormously. The device of the handkerchief to protect a hand firing a gun was no doubt a part of one of those schemes, but it served admirably for the one he finally used. This morning he learned that Miss Geer was to call on me at six o'clock, and he was to impersonate me. After lunch, in here alone, he got a cushion from the sofa in there, wrapped his revolver in it, and fired a bullet through the back of this chair into the wall. He could, if he wished, have held the thing right against the back of the chair, and probably did. He stuffed the cushion into the rear compartment of the bottom right-hand drawer of this desk, having observed that the contents of the front of the drawer indicated that it was rarely opened.
He put the gun in his pocket. He kept the chair pushed back to the wall to cover the hole in the plaster. The hole in the leather was not conspicuous and he took the risk of its being seen; when he was in the chair he covered the hole with his head."
==> "If the hole had been seen the bullet would have been found," Cramer muttered. <==
"I have already pronounced him," Wolfe said testily, "an unsurpassable fool. Even so, he knew that Archie would be out with him the rest of the afternoon, and I would be in my room. I had made a remark which informed him that I would not sit in that chair again until he was permanently out of it. At six o'clock Miss Geer arrived, unexpectedly accompanied by Mr. Jensen. They were shown into the front room, and that door was open. Mr. Root's brain moved swiftly, and so did the rest of him. He got one of my guns from Archie's desk, returned to this chair, opened the drawer where he had put the cushion, fired a shot into the cushion, dropped the gun in, and shut the drawer."
Wolfe sighed again. "Archie came dashing in, cast a glance at Mr. Root seated here, and went on to the front room. Mr. Root grasped the opportunity to do two things: return my gun to the drawer of Archie's desk, and use a blade of his knife, I would guess the awl, to tear a gash in the corner of his ear. That of course unproved the situation for him. But what improved it vastly more was the chance that came soon after, when Archie took him to the bathroom and left him there. He might have found another chance, but that was perfect.


He entered the front room from the bathroom, put his own gun, handkerchief attached, in the vase, and returned to the bathroom, and later rejoined the others here."

"Jesus!" Purley Stebbins said incredulously. "That guy would jump off the Empire State Building to catch an airplane by the tail."
==> "No doubt," Wolfe agreed. "I have called him a fool; and yet it was by no means utterly preposterous if I had not noticed the absence of that cushion. Since this desk sits flush with the floor, no sign of the bullet fired into the bottom drawer would be visible unless the drawer was opened, and why should it be? It was unlikely that Archie would have occasion to find that one of my guns in his desk had been fired, and what if he did? Mr. Root knows how to handle a gun without leaving fingerprints, which is simple. Confound it, no. It was entirely feasible for him to await an opportunity to kill me, this evening, tonight, tomorrow morning, with all suspicion aimed at Miss Geer and Mr. Jensen - and disappear." Cramer slowly nodded. "I'm not objecting. I'll buy it. But you must admit you've described quite a few things you can't prove." <==
"I don't have to. Neither do you. As I said before, Mr. Root will be put on trial for the murder of Mr. Jensen and Mr. Doyle, not for his antics here in my house. And I wish you would take him somewhere else. I've seen enough of him."
"I can't say I blame you," Cramer grinned, which was rare. He stood up. "Let's go, Mr. Root." after letting them out and watching Cramer and Purley manipulating Hackett-Root down the steps to the sidewalk and into the police car, I shut the door without bothering about the bolt and returned to the office. Jane and Jensen were standing side by side in front of Wolfe's desk, just barely not holding hands, beaming down at him.
"... more than neat," Jensen was saying. "It was absolutely brilliant."
"I still can't believe it," Jane declared. "It was wonderful."
"It was merely a job," Wolfe murmured, as if he knew what modesty was.

She neither spoke to me nor looked at me. Jensen was about as bad. I don't

 remember any two hours in my experience with a lower score on joviality. So I appreciated the break in the monotony when, a little before nine, I heard the doorbell. Since the door from the front room to the hall was also soundproof, that was all I got out of it except for the faint vibration of footsteps and an even fainter sound of voices. But in about three minutes the door to the hall opened and Fritz came in. He shut the door behind him and spoke, not very loud.
"Archie, Mr. Wolfe wants you in the office. Inspector Cramer is there with Sergeant Stebbins. I am to stay here."
He held out his hand for the gun. I gave it to him and went.
==> If the situation in the front room had been unjovial, the one in the office was absolutely grim. One glance at Wolfe was enough to see that he was in a state of uncontrollable fury, because his forefinger was making the same circle, over and over, on the surface of his desk. Sergeant Purley Stebbins was standing by the wall, looking official. Inspector Cramer was in the red leather chair, with his face about the color of the chair. <==
Nobody bothered to glance at me. Wolfe snapped, "Your notebook."
I crossed to my desk and got book and pencil and sat down. "This," I observed, "is what comes of my not attending to the doorbell. If we didn't want company - "
"Pfui." Wolfe tapped a piece of paper on his desk. "Look at this."
I arose and looked. It was a search warrant. "The premises ... owned and inhabited by said Nero Wolfe ... situate ..."
Wowie. I was surprised that Cramer was still alive, or Wolfe either. Cramer growled, holding himself in, "I'll try to forget what you just said, Wolfe. It was totally uncalled for. Goddam it, you have given me a runaround too many times. There I was, with that gun. A bullet fired from it matched the bullet you sent me and also the two that killed Jensen and Doyle. That's the gun, and you sent it to me. All right, then you've got a client, and when you've got a client you keep

 him right in your pocket. I would have been a goddam fool to come here and start begging you. I've begged you before."
Wolfe had started making the circle again. "I repeat, sir," he murmured, "that your acceptance of your salary constitutes a fraud on the people of New York and you are a disgrace to an honorable profession."
Cramer’s face had reached the red of the chair and was going on from there. "Then," he said, "I won't try to forget it. We're going to search this house." He started to leave the chair.
"If you do you'll never catch the murderer of Mr. Jensen and Mr. Doyle." Cramer dropped back in the chair. "I won't? You'll prevent me?"
"Bah." Wolfe was disgusted. "Next you'll be warning me formally that obstruction of justice is a crime. I didn't say that the murderer wouldn't be caught, I said you wouldn't catch him. Because I already have."
==> A grunt came from Purley Stebbins, but no one noticed it but me. I grinned at him. Cramer said, "The hell you have." <==
"Yes, sir. Your report on the gun and bullets settles it. But I confess the matter is a little complicated, and I do give you a formal warning: you are not equipped to handle it. I am." Wolfe shoved the warrant across the desk. "Tear that thing up."
Cramer slowly shook his head. "You see, Wolfe, I know you. God, don't I know you! But I'm willing to have a talk before I execute it."
"No, sir." Wolfe was murmuring again. "I will not submit to duress. I would even prefer to deal with district Attorney Skinner. Tear it up, or proceed to execute it."
That was a dirty threat. Cramer's opinion of Skinner was one of the defects of our democratic system of government. Cramer looked at the warrant, at Wolfe, at me, and back at the warrant. Then he picked it up and tore. I reached for the pieces and dropped them in the wastebasket.
Wolfe didn't look gratified because he was still too sore to let any other emotion in, but he did quit murmuring and allowed himself to talk. "Confound it," he said. "Don't ever waste your time like that again. Or mine. Can the gun be

 traced?"
"No. The number's gone. It dates from about nineteen-ten. And there are no prints on it that are worth a damn. Nothing but smudges."
Wolfe nodded. "Naturally. A much simpler technique than wiping it clean or going around in gloves."
He glanced at Stebbins. "Please sit down, sir. Your standing there annoys me." Back to Cramer. "The murderer is in this house."
"I suspected he was. Is he your client?"
==> Wolfe let that one go by without even waving at it. Leaning back in his chair, adjusting himself with accompanying grunts, and interlacing his fingers at the Greenwich meridian on his equator, he was ready to forget the search warrant and get down to business. I winked at Purley, but he pretended not to see it. He had his notebook too, but hadn't put anything in it yet. <==
"The main complication," Wolfe said in his purring tone, "is this. There are a man and a woman in the front room. Granting that one of them is the murderer, which one?"
Cramer frowned at him. "You didn't say anything about granting. You said that you had caught the murderer."
"So I have. He or she is in there, under guard. I suppose I'll have to tell you what happened, if I expect you to start your army of men digging, and it looks as though that's the only way to go about it. I have no army. To begin with, when I received that threat I hired a man who resembles me - superficially - in physical characteristics to be visible, both in this house and on the street, and I kept to my room. Nothing occurred - "
"Not involved, not inter - "
"Please don't interrupt," Wolfe snapped. "I'm telling you what happened."

"Please don't interrupt," Wolfe snapped. "I'm telling you what happened."
==> He did so. I have a high opinion of myself as a reporter of a series of events, but, listening to Wolfe as an expert, I had to admit I couldn't have done much better. He didn't waste any words, but he got it all in. Purley nearly bit the end of his <==

 tongue off, trying to get it all in his notebook, but I didn't bother.
Wolfe finished. Cramer sat scowling. Wolfe purred, "Well, sir, there's the problem. I doubt if it can be solved with what we have, or what is available on the premises. You'll have to get your men started on the indicated lines. Ill be available for consultation."
"I wish," Cramer growled, gazing at him as if he were looking at a puzzle he had seen and worked at many times but had never got solved, "I wish I knew how much dressing you put on that."
"Not any. I have only one concern in this. I have no client. I withheld nothing and added nothing."

"No, sir." Fritz gazed at the sofa and counted.
"That's right. They've been rearranged to take up the space. I don't understand it. They were all here yesterday when I cleaned in here."
"Are you sure of that?"
"Yes, sir. Positive."
"Look for it. Archie, help him. I want to know if that cushion is in this room."
==> It seemed like an odd moment to send out a general alarm for a sofa cushion, but since I had nothing else to do at the moment I obliged. Cramer and Purley went <==

 on solving a murder and Fritz and I went on hunting the cushion. Jensen watched both operations. Wolfe watched only one - Fritz's and mine. Jane pretended there was no one in the room but her.
I finally told Wolfe, "It's gone. It isn't in here." He muttered at me, "I see it isn't."
I stared at him. There was an expression on his face that I knew well. It wasn't exactly excitement, though it always stirred excitement in me. His neck was rigid, as if to prevent any movement of the head, so as not to disturb the brain, his eyes were half shut and not seeing anything, and his lips were moving, pushing out, then relaxing, then pushing out again. I knew it would take more than the loss of a velvet cushion to produce that effect on him. I stared at him.
Suddenly he turned and spoke. "Mr. Cramer! Please leave Mr. Stebbins in here with Miss Geer and Mr. Jensen. You can stay here too, or come with me, as you prefer. Fritz and Archie, come." He headed for the office. Cramer, knowing Wolfe's tones of voice almost as well as I did, spoke to Stebbins and then followed. Fritz and I also followed. So did Jane's voice.

I had no hand in the phone call to General Fife - or rather, as I learned later, to Colonel Voss, who was on duty that evening at the downtown G-2 headquarters - because I was busy with the chores. First, with regard to Jane and Jensen. When I delivered Wolfe's message to them, in a few well-chosen words, they blinked in bewilderment, which was understandable. Then they both opened the valves and here came the steam. I silenced them by mere force of personality.
I told Jensen, "You came to see Wolfe to get him to help catch the murderer of your father. He has not only helped, he has done it singlehanded, practically without getting out of bed. For God's sake, what more do you want?"
I told Jane, "You wanted to avoid publicity as a suspect in a murder case so you can be a vice-president. Wolfe has done the avoiding for you. As my contribution, I have made you acquainted with this prominent major. You should beef?"
Naturally they voted for joining the throng in the office, and their pose during the balloting was significant.
==> They stood facing each other, with Jensen's right hand on Jane's left shoulder, and Jane's right hand, or perhaps just the fingers, on Jensen's left forearm. I left it to them to find the way to the office alone, told Purley Stebbins what our job was, and took him upstairs with me to the south room. <==
It was approximately ten minutes later that we delivered our cargo in the office. Even though Mr. Hackett staged one of the most convincing demonstrations of unwillingness to co-operate that I have ever encountered, beginning the instant I put a hand on him to frisk him, only about six of the ten minutes were devoted to persuading him that there were worse things than going downstairs. For the other four minutes I sat on him, examining my shin to see if his kicks had busted the skin and testing my wrist to decide if it was sprained, while Purley was in the bathroom washing blood off his cheek and neck and applying BandAids.


Not that Hackett had confined himself to kicking and scratching; he hadn't confined himself at all. Purley and I did the confining.
We got him to the office in one piece, nothing really wrong with him but a few bruises, and put him in a chair. Purley took an upright position right behind him, with the evident intention of standing by, so I went to my desk. Jane and Jensen were on a couple of chairs side by side, over near the big globe. Cramer was as before.

It was approximately ten minutes later that we delivered our cargo in the office. Even though Mr. Hackett staged one of the most convincing demonstrations of unwillingness to co-operate that I have ever encountered, beginning the instant I put a hand on him to frisk him, only about six of the ten minutes were devoted to persuading him that there were worse things than going downstairs. For the other four minutes I sat on him, examining my shin to see if his kicks had busted the skin and testing my wrist to decide if it was sprained, while Purley was in the bathroom washing blood off his cheek and neck and applying BandAids.


==> Not that Hackett had confined himself to kicking and scratching; he hadn't confined himself at all. Purley and I did the confining. <==
We got him to the office in one piece, nothing really wrong with him but a few bruises, and put him in a chair. Purley took an upright position right behind him, with the evident intention of standing by, so I went to my desk. Jane and Jensen were on a couple of chairs side by side, over near the big globe. Cramer was as before.
I said, "He was reluctant."
I'll say one thing for Wolfe, I've never seen him gloat over a guy about to get it. He was contemplating Hackett more as an extraordinary object that deserved study.
I said, "Purley thinks he knows him."
Purley, as was proper, spoke to his superior. "I swear, Inspector, I'm sure I've seen him somewhere, but I can't remember."

Wolfe shook his head. "Mr. Cramer told me Wednesday morning that the doorman on duty at the apartment house at the time Mr. Jensen and Mr. Doyle were killed was a fat nitwit who had been hired two weeks ago and didn't know the tenants by name, and also that he claimed to have been in the basement stoking the water heater at the moment the murders were committed. A phone call would tell us whether he is still working there."
"He isn't," Cramer growled. "He left Wednesday afternoon because he didn't like a place where people got murdered. I never saw him. Some of my men did."

 you look a little dazed. Can you hear what I'm saying?"
Hackett made no sound and didn't flutter an eyelid.
"I guess you can," Wolfe went on. "This will interest you. I requested Military Intelligence to have an examination made of the effects of Captain Peter Root at the prison in Maryland. A few minutes ago I phoned for a report, and got it. Captain Root was lying when he stated that he was not in communication with his father and had not been for years. There are several letters from his father among his belongings, dated in the past two months, and they make it evident that his father, whose name is Thomas Root, regards him as a scion to be proud of. To the point of mania." Wolfe wiggled a finger at Hackett. "I offer the conjecture that you are in a position to know whether that is correct or not. Is it?"

"I have already pronounced him," Wolfe said testily, "an unsurpassable fool. Even so, he knew that Archie would be out with him the rest of the afternoon, and I would be in my room. I had made a remark which informed him that I would not sit in that chair again until he was permanently out of it. At six o'clock Miss Geer arrived, unexpectedly accompanied by Mr. Jensen. They were shown into the front room, and that door was open. Mr. Root's brain moved swiftly, and so did the rest of him. He got one of my guns from Archie's desk, returned to this chair, opened the drawer where he had put the cushion, fired a shot into the cushion, dropped the gun in, and shut the drawer."
Wolfe sighed again. "Archie came dashing in, cast a glance at Mr. Root seated here, and went on to the front room. Mr. Root grasped the opportunity to do two things: return my gun to the drawer of Archie's desk, and use a blade of his knife, I would guess the awl, to tear a gash in the corner of his ear. That of course unproved the situation for him. But what improved it vastly more was the chance that came soon after, when Archie took him to the bathroom and left him there. He might have found another chance, but that was perfect.


He entered the front room from the bathroom, put his own gun, handkerchief attached, in the vase, and returned to the bathroom, and later rejoined the others here."
==> "Jesus!" Purley Stebbins said incredulously. "That guy would jump off the Empire State Building to catch an airplane by the tail." <==
"No doubt," Wolfe agreed. "I have called him a fool; and yet it was by no means utterly preposterous if I had not noticed the absence of that cushion. Since this desk sits flush with the floor, no sign of the bullet fired into the bottom drawer would be visible unless the drawer was opened, and why should it be? It was unlikely that Archie would have occasion to find that one of my guns in his desk had been fired, and what if he did? Mr. Root knows how to handle a gun without leaving fingerprints, which is simple. Confound it, no. It was entirely feasible for him to await an opportunity to kill me, this evening, tonight, tomorrow morning, with all suspicion aimed at Miss Geer and Mr. Jensen - and disappear." Cramer slowly nodded. "I'm not objecting. I'll buy it. But you must admit you've described quite a few things you can't prove."
"I don't have to. Neither do you. As I said before, Mr. Root will be put on trial for the murder of Mr. Jensen and Mr. Doyle, not for his antics here in my house. And I wish you would take him somewhere else. I've seen enough of him."
"I can't say I blame you," Cramer grinned, which was rare. He stood up. "Let's go, Mr. Root." after letting them out and watching Cramer and Purley manipulating Hackett-Root down the steps to the sidewalk and into the police car, I shut the door without bothering about the bolt and returned to the office. Jane and Jensen were standing side by side in front of Wolfe's desk, just barely not holding hands, beaming down at him.
"... more than neat," Jensen was saying. "It was absolutely brilliant."
"I still can't believe it," Jane declared. "It was wonderful."

Nobody paid any attention to me. I sat down and yawned. Jensen seemed to be hesitating about something, then abruptly got it out.

 fighting Germans or Japs, and anyhow, we had just deposited a five-figure check from a certain client.
Jensen got sore, naturally, but Wolfe only murmured at him that he might succeed in interesting the police or that we would be glad to give him a list of reliable detective agencies which would provide companions for his movements as long as he remained alive - at sixty bucks for twenty-four hours. Jensen said that wasn't it, he wanted to hire Wolfe's brains.
Wolfe merely made a face and shook his head. Then Jensen wanted to know what about Goodwin? Wolfe said that Major Goodwin was an officer in the United States Army.
"He's not in uniform," Jensen growled.
Wolfe grunted. "He’ll waste his money. I doubt the urgency of his peril. A man planning a murder doesn't spend his energy clipping pieces out of advertisements of motion pictures."
==> That was Tuesday. The next morning, Wednesday, the papers headlined the murder of Ben Jensen on the front page. Eating breakfast in the kitchen with Fritz, as usual, I was only halfway through the report in the Times when the doorbell rang, and when I answered it. <==
I found on the stoop our old friend Inspector Cramer of the Homicide Squad.

Nero Wolfe said, "Not interested, not involved, and not curious."
He was a sight, as he always was when propped up in bed with his breakfast tray. The custom was for Fritz to deliver the tray to his room on the second floor at eight o'clock. It was now eight-fifteen, and already down the gullet were the peaches and cream, most of the unrationed bacon, and two-thirds of the eggs, not to mention coffee and the green tomato jam. The black silk coverlet was folded back, and you had to look to tell where the yellow percale sheet ended and the yellow pajamas began. Few people except Fritz and me ever got to see him like that, but he had stretched a point for Inspector Cramer, who knew that from nine

It was now eight-fifteen, and already down the gullet were the peaches and cream, most of the unrationed bacon, and two-thirds of the eggs, not to mention coffee and the green tomato jam. The black silk coverlet was folded back, and you had to look to tell where the yellow percale sheet ended and the yellow pajamas began. Few people except Fritz and me ever got to see him like that, but he had stretched a point for Inspector Cramer, who knew that from nine <==

 to eleven he would be up in the plant rooms with the orchids and unavailable.
"In the past dozen years," Cramer said in his ordinary growl, without any particular feeling, "you have told me, I suppose, in round figures, ten million lies."
The commas were chews on his unlighted cigar. He looked the way he always did when he had been working all night - peevish and put upon but under control, all except his hair, which had forgotten where the part went.
Wolfe, who was hard to rile at breakfast, swallowed toast and jam and then coffee, ignoring the insult. Cramer said, "He came to see you yesterday morning, twelve hours before he was killed. You don't deny that."

YOU ARE ABOUT TO DIE - AND I WILL WATCH YOU DIE!

"It sure is a coincidence," I remarked, grinning at him.
III
I thought he would at least mutter "Indeed," but he didn't. He looked at the exhibits for a moment without touching them, sent me a sharp glance indicating an instantaneous suspicion that I was implicated, and said without any perceptible quiver, "I'll look over the mail at eleven o'clock as usual."
==> It was the grand manner all right. Seeing he was impervious, I retrieved the exhibits without a word, returned to the office, and busied myself with the chores - letters to write, vital statistics of orchids to enter on cards, and similar manly tasks. Nor did he fudge on the time. It was eleven on the dot when he came down, got into his oversized chair behind his desk, and began the routine - going through the mail I had not discarded, signing checks, inspecting the bank balance, dictating letters and memos, glancing down at his calendar pad, and ringing for beer. Not until Fritz had brought the beer and he had irrigated his interior did he lean back in his chair, let his eyes go half shut, and observe: <==
"Archie, you could easily have clipped that thing from the magazine, bought an envelope and printed my name and address on it, stamped it and mailed it. Nothing would have been simpler."
I grinned at him and shook my head. "Not my style. besides, what for? I never exert myself without a purpose. Besides again, would I be apt to infuriate and embitter you at this moment, when I know General Carpenter will phone for your opinion?"
"You will, of course, postpone your trip to Washington."
I let my frank, open countenance betray surprise. "I can't. I have an appointment with a lieutenant general; anyhow, why?" I indicated the envelope and clipping on his desk. "That tomfoolery? No panic is called for. I doubt the urgency of your peril. A man planning a murder doesn't spend his energy clipping pieces out of adver—"
"You are going to Washington?"

es, sir. I have a date. Of course I could phone Carpenter and tell him your nerves are a little shaky on account of an anony—"
"When do you leave?"
"I have a seat on the six o'clock train, but I could take a later—" "Very well. Then we have the day. Your notebook."
Wolfe leaned forward to pour beer and drink, and then leaned back again. "I offer a comment on your jocosity. When Mr. Jensen called here yesterday and showed us that thing we had no inkling of the character of the person who had sent it. It might have been merely the attempt of a coward to upset his digestion. We no longer enjoy that ignorance. This person not only promptly killed Mr. Jensen, with wit equal to his determination, but also killed Mr. Doyle, a stranger, whose presence could not have been foreseen. We now know that this person is cold-blooded, ruthless, quick to decide and to act, and an egomaniac."
==> "Yes, sir. I agree. If you go to bed and stay there until I get back from Washington, letting no one but Fritz enter the room, I may not be able to control my tongue when with you but actually I will understand and I won't tell anybody. You need a rest anyway. And don't lick any envelopes." <==
"Bah." Wolfe wiggled a finger at me. "That thing was not sent to you. Presumably you are not on the agenda."
"Yes, sir."
"And this person is dangerous and requires attention." "I agree."
"Very well." Wolfe shut his eyes. "Take notes as needed. It may be assumed, if this person means business with me as he did with Mr. Jensen, that this is connected with the case of Captain Peter Root. I had no other association whatever with Mr. Jensen - learn the whereabouts of Captain Root."
"The court-martial gave him three years in the cooler."

Wolfe's eyes half opened for an instant. "You have a habit of knowing how to locate personable young women without delay. Have you seen that one recently?"
"Oh," I said offhand, "I sort of struck up an acquaintance with her. I guess I can get in touch with her. But I doubt - "
"Do so. I want to see her. Excuse me for interrupting, but you have a train to catch. Also inform Inspector Cramer of this development and suggest that he investigate captain Root's background - his relatives and intimates - anyone besides Miss Geer who might thirst for vengeance at his disgrace. I'll do that. If Captain Root is in prison, arrange with General Fife to bring him here. I want to have a talk with him. Where is the clipping received yesterday by Mr. Jensen? Ask Mr. Cornwall and Mr. Cramer. There is the possibility that this is not another one like it, but the same one."
I shook my head. "No, sir. This one is clipped closer to the printing at the upper right."
"I noticed that, but ask anyway. Inspect the chain bolts on the doors and test the night gong in your room.
==> Fritz will sleep in your room tonight. I shall speak to Fritz and Theodore. All of this can easily be attended to by telephone except Miss Geer, and that is your problem. Do not for the present mention her to Mr. Cramer. I want to see her before he does. When will you return from Washington?" <==
'I should be able to catch a noon train back - my appointment's at nine. Getting here around five." I added earnestly, "If I can clear it with Carpenter to cross the ocean, I will of course arrange not to leave until this ad-clipper has been attended to. I wouldn't want - "
"Don't hurry back on my account. Or alter your plans. You receive a salary from the government."
Wolfe's tone was dry, sharp, and icy, plainly intended to pierce all my vital organs at once. He went on with it, "Please get General Fife on the phone. We'll begin by learning about Captain Root."

The program went smoothly, all except the Jane Geer number. If it hadn't been for her I'd have been able to make the six o'clock train with hours to spare.

I took her. I paid the check and we went out and got a taxi. during the brief ride downtown and crosstown she got more realistic. She said, among other things, "I was taken in by Peter Root. I thought he was innocent and was being made the goat. So I expressed myself accordingly, and why shouldn't I? But I am over all that, as you know unless you are a two-faced subhuman Pithecanthropus, and

 this business about the murder of that Jensen, which I read about in the morning paper, is utter poppycock. I'm a working girl. After my experience with the charming, irresistible Peter I wouldn't marry a combination of Winston Churchill and Victor Mature. I wouldn't even marry you. I have a future. I intend to become the first female vice-president of the biggest advertising agency in the country. I never will, or anyway not for years, if my name is made public as a suspect in a murder case. The publicity about me in the Peter Root business didn't help me any, and this would about finish me."
"Don't," I advised her, "take that line with Nero Wolfe. His attitude toward women as business executives is a little peculiar, not to mention his attitude toward women."
"I'll handle Nero Wolfe." "Hooray. No one ever has yet."
==> I didn't get to see her try, because she didn't get to see Wolfe. Since chain-bolt orders were in effect, my key wouldn't let us in and I had to ring the doorbell for Fritz. I had just pushed the button when who should appear, mounting the steps to join us on the stoop, but the Army officer that they use for a model when they want to do a picture conveying the impression that masculine comeliness will win the war. I admit he was handsome; I admitted it to myself right then, when I first saw him. He looked preoccupied and concentrated, but even so he found time for a glance at Jane, which was actually nothing against him, especially when you consider that she also found time for a glance at him. at that moment the door swung open and I spoke to Fritz. "Okay, thanks. Is Mr. Wolfe in the office?" <==
"No, he's up in his room."
"All right, I'll take it." Fritz departed, and I maneuvered into position to dominate the scene, on the doorsill facing out. I spoke to the masculine model.
"Yes, Major? This is Nero Wolfe's place."
"I know it is." He had a baritone voice that suited him to a T. "I want to see him. My name is Emil Jensen. I am the son of Ben Jensen, who was killed last night."
"Oh." There wasn't much resemblance, but that's nature's lookout. I have enough

 have a theory that generals should be rubbed liberally with neat's-foot oil before being taken out and shot. Though I doubt if I would have bothered with the oil in the case of General Carpenter that morning if I had had a free hand.
I was a major. So I sat and said yessir, yessir, yessir, while he told me that he had given me the appointment only because he thought I wanted to discuss something of importance, and that I would stay where I was put, and that the question of my going overseas had been decided long ago and I would shut my trap about it. I never found out whether Wolfe had phoned him or not.
He didn't phone Wolfe. He didn't even pat me on the head and tell me there, there, be a good soldier. He merely said, in effect, nuts. Then he observed that since I was in Washington I might as well confer with the staff on various cases, finished and unfinished, and would I report immediately to Colonel Dickey.
I doubt if I made a good impression, considering my state of mind. They kept me around, conferring, all day Thursday and most of Friday. I phoned Wolfe that I was detained. By explaining the situation on Thirty-fifth Street I could have got permission to beat it back to New York, but I wasn't going to give that collection of brass headgear an excuse to giggle around that Nero Wolfe didn't have brains enough to arrange to keep on breathing, in his own house, without me there to look after him. Besides, I knew that Carpenter would have phoned Wolfe, out of courtesy as well as concern, and Wolfe's reaction to that when I got back would be apt to displease me. but I was tempted to hop a plane when, late Thursday evening, I saw the ad in the Star. I had been too busy all day, and at dinner with a bunch of them and after, to take a look at a New York paper. I was alone in my hotel room when it caught my eye, bordered and spaced to make a spot:
WANTED A MAN weighing about 260-270, around 5 ft. 11, 45-56 years old, medium in coloring, waist not over 48, capable of easy and normal movement. Temporary. Hazardous. $100 a day. Send photo with letter. Box 292 Star.
==> I read it through four times, stared at it disapprovingly for an additional two minutes, and then reached for the phone and put in a New York call. It was going on midnight, but Wolfe never went to bed early. But when the connection was made, after a short wait, it wasn't his voice that I heard. It was Fritz Brenner's. <==
"Mr. Nero Wolfe's residence."


Fritz, who had been with Wolfe even longer than me, had his own ideas about certain details. When he answered the phone in the daytime between nine and five he said, "Mr. Nero Wolfe's office." At any other time he said, "Mr. Nero Wolfe's residence."
"Hello, Fritz. Archie. Calling from Washington. Where's Mr. Wolfe?"

"He's in bed. He had a hard day. And evening."
"Doing what?"
"He was very busy on the telephone. Also some callers. Mr. Cramer. And he had that stenographer from that place."
"Oh. He did. Using my typewriter. Do you happen to know whether he looked at the Star today?"

"Get it, and look at an ad, a small one in a box, near the lower right corner on page eleven. Read it. I'll hold the wire."
I sat and waited. Before long he was back on.
"I read it." He sounded puzzled. "Are you calling clear from Washington to make a joke?"
"I am not. I don't feel like joking. The Army won't let me go anywhere. They turned me down. As you read the ad, who did it make you think of?"
"Well - it entered my mind that it was just about a good description of Mr. Wolfe."

"General Carpenter."
"Oh. The devil." He looked worried. "Then it will have to go to him, and he's tied up. I'll tell you what we'd better do."
He told me what we'd better do. I listened attentively, but it didn't register. Doomed was no word for it.


==> I was sunk for the duration, possibly for life. I told him there was no great rush, it could wait till morning. I would ask Major Zabreskie myself, and managed to break away from him. I got into a corridor, made it to the ground floor, used all my faculties, and succeeded in breaking through to the open air. My trained mind and years of experience as a detective got me onto the right bus. Five minutes at the hotel were enough to get my bag and pay my bill, and I shared a taxi to the airport and bought a ticket to New York. Eating could wait, but it didn't. I did. There was no room on either the six-thirty or the seven-thirty, so, with both appetite and time, I tried four kinds of sandwiches and found them all edible. Finally I got a seat on the eight-thirty plane, and when it landed at La Guardia Field an hour and a half later I began to feel safe. Surely I could elude them in the throngs of the great metropolis. Actually I was offering ten to one that by morning everybody at the Pentagon would have forgotten that I had been there. arriving at Wolfe's house on Thirty-fifth Street a little before eleven, I didn't get out my key because I knew the door would be bolted and I would need help. I gave the button three short pushes as usual, and in a moment there were footsteps, and the curtain was pulled aside, and Fritz was peering at me through the glass panel. Satisfied, he let me in and greeted me with a tone and expression indicating that he was pleased to see me. I saw Wolfe was in the office, since the door to it was open and the light shining through, so I breezed down the hall and on in. <==
"I am a fug—" I began, and stopped. Wolfe's chair behind his desk, his own chair and no one else's under any circumstances, was occupied by the appropriate mass of matter in comparatively human shape, in other words by a big fat man, but it wasn't Nero Wolfe. I had never seen him before.
V
Fritz, who had stayed to bolt the door, came at me from behind, talking. The occupant of the chair neither moved nor spoke, but merely leered at me. I would have called it a leer. I became aware that Fritz was telling me that Mr. Wolfe was up in his room.
The specimen in the chair said in a husky croak, "I suppose you're Goodwin. Archie. Have a good trip?"

That was enough of that. I marched out to the hall and up a flight, went to Wolfe's door and tapped on it, and called, "Archie!" Wolfe's voice told me to come in, and I entered. He was seated in his number two chair, under the light, reading a book. He was fully dressed, and there was nothing in his appearance to indicate that he had lost his mind.
I did not intend to give him the satisfaction of sitting there smirking and enjoying fireworks. "Well," I said casually, "I got back. If you're sleepy we can wait till morning for conversation."
"I'm not sleepy." He closed the book with a finger inserted at his page. "Are you going to Europe?"
"You know damn well I'm not." I sat down. "We can discuss that at some future date when I'm out of the army. It's a relief to find you all alive and well around here. It's very interesting down in Washington. Everybody on their toes."

"No doubt. Did you stop in the office downstairs?"
==> "I did. So you put that ad in the Star yourself. How do you pay him, cash every day? Did you figure out the deductions for income tax and social security? I sat down at my desk and began to report to him. I thought it was you. Until he ordered Fritz to bring him a highball, and I know you hate highballs. Deduction. It reminds me of the time your daughter from Yugoslavia showed up and got us in a mess. Now your twin. At a century per diem it will amount to thirty-six thousand, five hundred - " <==
"Archie. Shut up."
"Yes, sir. Shall I go down and chat with him?"


Wolfe put the book down and shifted in his chair with the routine grunts. When the new equilibrium was established he said, "You will find details about him on a slip of paper in the drawer of your desk. He is a retired architect named H. H. Hackett, out of funds, and an unsurpassed nincompoop with the manners of a wart hog. I chose him, from those answering the advertisement, because his appearance and build were the most suitable and he is sufficiently an ass to be willing to risk his life for a hundred dollars a day."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 28981    window = 28976 28986


 to the point of rashness. He can probably be tempted to proceed with his program. I am aware that if you drive Mr. Hackett around, and accompany him into the car and out of it, crossing sidewalks at all hours of the day and night, you may get killed. That sort of thing was understood when I employed you and paid you. Now the government pays you. Perhaps Mr. Cramer has a man who resembles you and could be assigned to this. He would have to be a good man, alert and resourceful, for there's no point to this if an attempt on Mr. Hackett's life leaves us as empty-handed as we are now. You can give me your decision in the morning."
I'm surprised that I was able to speak at all. He had of course insulted me a million times, as I had him, but this was worse than an insult, there was no word for it. coming on top of the turndown I had got in Washington, which had reduced my buoyancy to a record low, it made me so mad that I knew I'd better get out of there. but I did not intend to let him go to bed feeling noble, so I grinned at him and controlled my voice.
"Okay," I told him. "I'll think it over. Sure, Cramer has a lot of good men. Let you know in the morning. I'll remember to turn the gong on."
I went up to my room.
The gong was a dingus under my bed. The custom was that when I retired at night I turned a switch, and if anyone put his foot down in the hall within ten feet of Wolfe's door the gong gonged. It had been installed on account of a certain occurrence some years previously, when Wolfe had got a knife stuck in him. The thing had never gone off except when we tested it, and in my opinion never would, but I never failed to switch it on because if Wolfe had stepped into the hall some night and the gong hadn't sounded it would have caused discussion.
==> This night, with a stranger in the house, I was glad it was there. I learned from Fritz that H. H. Hackett was sleeping in the south room, on the same floor as me, and on the basis of my brief acquaintance and my one look at him it wouldn't have surprised me if he had undertaken to sneak into Wolfe's room during the night and kill him, dispose of the body down in the furnace, and expect Fritz and me to take him for Wolfe and never catch on. Women and girls of appropriate age and configuration may call me Archie and welcome. With the rest of my fellow beings I am particular. The Hackett person would have had to know me seven years to get the privilege, and I neither desired nor intended that he should <==

 know me seven weeks.
In the morning, breakfast was all over the place, with Wolfe in his room, Hackett in the dining-room, and me in the kitchen with Fritz. Afterwards I spent an hour up in the plant rooms with Wolfe, on the matters we usually attended to in the office, together with consideration of the current problem. Wolfe asked if I had decided whether we should get a chauffeur for Hackett from the Homicide Squad.
I looked judicious. "I have," I told him, "thought it over from all angles. Unquestionably Cramer could give us a man who would be my superior in courage, wit, integrity, reflex time, and purity of morals. But here's the trouble— not one anything like as handsome as me. Not a chance. So I'll do it myself."
Wolfe cocked an eye at me. "I meant no offense. My intentions—"

I went up to my room.
The gong was a dingus under my bed. The custom was that when I retired at night I turned a switch, and if anyone put his foot down in the hall within ten feet of Wolfe's door the gong gonged. It had been installed on account of a certain occurrence some years previously, when Wolfe had got a knife stuck in him. The thing had never gone off except when we tested it, and in my opinion never would, but I never failed to switch it on because if Wolfe had stepped into the hall some night and the gong hadn't sounded it would have caused discussion.
This night, with a stranger in the house, I was glad it was there. I learned from Fritz that H. H. Hackett was sleeping in the south room, on the same floor as me, and on the basis of my brief acquaintance and my one look at him it wouldn't have surprised me if he had undertaken to sneak into Wolfe's room during the night and kill him, dispose of the body down in the furnace, and expect Fritz and me to take him for Wolfe and never catch on.

"Forget it. You're under a strain. Mr. Hackett's life is in jeopardy and it makes you nervous."
We got to details. Jane Geer was making a nuisance of herself. I understood now, of course, why Wolfe had refused to see her Wednesday evening. After sending me to get her he had conceived the strategy of hiring a double, and he didn't want her to get a look at the real Nero Wolfe because if she did she would be less likely to be deceived by the counterfeit and go to work on him. That meant she was seriously on his list, but I didn't take the trouble to inform him that in my opinion he could cross her off, since he would only have grunted.
She had phoned several times, insisting on seeing him, and had come to the house Friday morning and argued for five minutes with Fritz through the three- inch crack which the chain bolt permitted the door to open to. Now Wolfe had an idea for one of his elaborate charades. I was to phone her to come to see Wolfe at six o'clock that afternoon. When she came I was to take her in to Hackett. Wolfe would coach Hackett for the interview.

Wolfe would coach Hackett for the interview. <==
I looked skeptical. Wolfe said, "It will give her a chance to kill Mr. Hackett." I snorted. "With me right there to tell her when to cease firing!"
"I admit it is unlikely. Also, it will convince her that Mr. Hackett' is me." "Which still will not shorten his life or lengthen yours."


"Possibly not. Also, it will give me an opportunity to see her and tiear her. I shall be at the hole."

"He has reformed. I showed him a lock of your hair. I showed him a picture of Elsa Maxwell and told him it was you. This time he won't let me come after you."
"Neither will I."
"Okay. Be here at six o'clock and you will be received. Six o'clock today, p.m. Will you?"
She admitted that she would. I made a couple of other calls and did some miscellaneous chores. But I found that my jaw was getting clamped tighter and tighter on account of an irritating noise. Finally I spoke to the occupant of Wolfe's chair. "What kind of cookies are those?"
"Ginger snaps." Evidently the husky croak was his normal voice. "I didn't know we had any."
==> "We didn't. I asked Fritz. He doesn't seem to know about ginger snaps, so I walked over to Ninth Avenue and got some." <==
"When? This morning?" "Just a little while ago."
I turned to my phone, buzzed the plant rooms, got Wolfe, and told him, "Mr. Hackett is sitting in your chair eating ginger snaps. Just a little while ago he walked to Ninth Avenue and bought them. If he pops in and out of the house whenever he sees fit, what are we getting for our hundred bucks?"
Wolfe spoke to the point. I hung up and turned to Hackett and spoke to the point. He was not to leave the house except as instructed by Wolfe or me. He seemed unimpressed and unconcerned, but nodded good-naturedly.
"All right," he said, "if that's the bargain I'll keep it. but there's two sides to a bargain. I was to be paid daily in advance, and I haven't been paid for today. A hundred dollars net."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 29031    window = 29026 29036


It seemed to satisfy him, for his eyes got less concentrated, but he didn't resume with the ginger snaps. At least I had accomplished that much. Using a matter-of- fact tone, which I thought would reassure him, I explained that he was to go to

 Wolfe's room at eleven-thirty for instructions, which would include our afternoon outing.
To tell the truth, by the time the afternoon was over and I had him back in the house again, a little after five-thirty, I had to maintain a firm hold on such details as ginger snaps and his calling me Archie to keep from admiring him. During that extended expedition we made stops at Brooks Brothers, Rusterman's, the Churchill, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Botanical Gardens, and three or four others. He occupied the rear seat, of course, because Wolfe always did, and the mirror showed me that he sat back comfortably, taking in the sights, a lot more imperturbable than Wolfe himself would have been, since Wolfe disliked motion, detested bumps, and had a settled notion that all the other cars had turned out for the express purpose of colliding with his.
When we made one of our stops and Hackett got out to cross the sidewalk, he was okay. He didn't hurry or dodge or jerk or weave, but just walked. In Wolfe's hat and coat and stick, he might even have fooled me. I had to hand it to him, in spite of the fact that the whole show struck me as the biggest bust Wolfe had ever concocted. at night it might be different, but here in broad daylight, and with no discernible evidence that anyone was on our trail, I felt foolish, futile, and fatuous, and still I had to keep alert, covering all directions, with the gun in my hand resting on the seat.
==> Nothing happened. Not a damn thing. back at the house, I left Hackett in the office and went to the kitchen, where Wolfe was sitting at the big table drinking beer and watching Fritz make tomato juice. His daily routine was of course all shot. <==
I reported, "They tried to get him from the top of the Palisades with a howitzer, but missed him. He has a little bruise on his left elbow from the revolving door at
Rusterman's, but otherwise unhurt." Wolfe grunted. "How did he behave?" "Okay."
Wolfe grunted again. "After dark we may more reasonably expect results. I repeat what I told you at noon: you will take an active part in the interview with

 Miss Geer, but you will restrain yourself. If you permit yourself to get fanciful, there is no telling what the effect may be on Mr. Hackett. As you know, his instructions are precise, but his discipline is questionable. See that she speaks up, so I can hear her. Seat her at the corner of my desk farthest from you so I will have a good view of her. The view through that hole is restricted."

"Certainly I smell it."
"Okay. Let's join Mr. Wolfe and discuss it. Through there." I indicated the door to the office with a flourish of the gun.
Jane started jabbering, but I paid no attention. She was merely jabbering, something indignant about a put-up job and so on. She was disinclined to enter the office, but when Jensen went she followed him and I brought up the rear.
"This is Mr. Nero Wolfe," I said. "Sit down." I was using my best judgment and figured I was playing it right because Wolfe was nowhere in sight. I had to decide what to do with them while I found the gun and maybe the bullet. Jane was still trying to jabber, but she stopped when Jensen blurted, "Wolfe has blood on his head!"
I stared at Hackett. He was standing up behind the desk, leaning forward with his hand resting on the desk, looking the three of us over with an expression that left it open whether he was dazed, scared, or angry, or all three. He didn't seem to hear Jensen's words. When I did I saw the blood on Hackett's left ear and dribbling down the side of his neck.
==> I took in a breath and yelled, "Fritz!" <==
He appeared instantly, probably having been standing by in the hall by Wolfe's direction. I told him to come here, and when he came handed him my gun. "If anybody reaches for a handkerchief, shoot."
"Those instructions," Jensen said sharply, "are dangerous if he - "

He's all right."
"I would like you to search me." Jensen stuck his hands toward the ceiling.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 29074    window = 29069 29079


"Those instructions," Jensen said sharply, "are dangerous if he - "

He's all right."
"I would like you to search me." Jensen stuck his hands toward the ceiling.
"That," I said, " is more like it," and crossed to him and explored him from neck to ankles, invited him to relax in a chair, and turned to Jane. She darted me a look of pure and lofty disgust and backed away as from a noxious miasma.
==> I remarked, "If you refuse to stand inspection and then you happen to make a gesture and Fritz shoots you in the tummy, don't blame me." <==
She darted more looks, but took it. I felt her over not quite as comprehensively as I had Jensen, took her bag and glanced in it and returned it to her, and then stepped around Wolfe's desk to examine Hackett's blood. He wasn't screaming or moaning, but the expression on his face was something. After Jensen had announced the blood, he had put his hand up to feel, and he was staring at the red on his fingers with his big jaw hanging open.
"My head?" he croaked. "Is it my head?"
The exhibition he was making of himself was no help to Nero Wolfe's reputation for intrepidity. After a brief look I told him distinctly, "No, sir. Nothing but a nick in the upper outside corner of your ear." I wiped with my handkerchief. "You might go to the bathroom and use a towel."
"I am not - hurt?"
I could have murdered him. Instead, I told Fritz, standing there with my gun, that unnecessary movements were still forbidden, and took Hackett to the bathroom in the far corner and shut the door behind me.

While I showed him the ear in the mirror and dabbed on some iodine and taped on a bandage, I told him to stay in there until his nerves calmed down and then rejoin us, act detached and superior, and let me do the talking.
He said he would, but at that moment I would have traded him for one wet cigarette. as I reappeared in the office, Jane shot at me, "Did you search him?" I ignored her and circled around Wolfe's desk for a look at the back of the chair. The head-rest was upholstered in brown leather; and about eight inches from the top and a foot from the side edge, a spot that would naturally have been on a line behind Hackett's left ear as he sat, there was a hole in the leather. I looked

 behind, and there was another hole on the rear side. I looked at the wall back of the chair and found still another hole, torn into the plaster. From the bottom draw of my desk I got a screwdriver and hammer, started chiseling, ran against a stud, and went to work with the point of my knife. When I finally turned around I held a small object between my thumb and finger. As I did so Hackett emerged from the bathroom, apparently more composed.
"Bullet," I said informatively. "Thirty-eight. Passed through Mr. Wolfe's ear and the back of his chair and ruined the wall. Patched plaster is an eyesore."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 29096    window = 29091 29101


"Sure." My tone cut slices off of them. "He tied a pillow around it, held it at arm's length, pointing it at his ear, and pulled the trigger. How would you like to try demonstrating it? Keeping the bullet within an inch of your frontal lobe?"
He never stopped gazing at me. "I am," he declared, "being completely objective. With some difficulty. I agree it is highly improbable."


"If I understand what happened - " Hackett began, but I doubted if he was going to offer anything useful, so I cut him off.
==> "Excuse me, sir. The bullet helps, but the gun would help still more. Let's be objective too. We might possibly find the object in the front room." I moved, touching his elbow to take him along. "Fritz, see that they stay put." <==
"I," said Jensen, getting up, "would like to be present - "
"The hell you would." I wheeled to him. My voice may have gone up a notch. "Sit down, brother. I am trying not to fly off the handle. I am trying not to be rude. Whose house is this, with bullets zipping around? I swear to God Fritz will shoot you in the knee."
He had another remark to contribute, and so did Jane, but I disregarded them and wrangled Hackett ahead of me into the front room and shut the soundproof door. Hackett began to talk, but I shut him off. He insisted he had something to say. I told him to spill it.
"It seems incredible," he asserted, meeting my eye and choosing his words, "that one of them could have shot at me from in here, through the open door, without me seeing anything."
"You said that before, in the bathroom. You also said you didn't remember whether your eyes were open or shut, or where you were looking, when you heard that shot." I moved my face to within fourteen inches of his. "See here. If you are suspecting that I shot at you, or that Wolfe did, you have got fleas or other insects playing tag in your brain and should have it attended to.

One thing alone: the way the bullet went, straight past your ear and into the chair back, it had to come from in front, the general direction of that door and this room.
It couldn't have come from the door in the hall or anywhere else, because we haven't got a gun that shoots a curve. I can't help it if your eyes were focused somewhere else or were closed or you went temporarily blind. You will please sit in that chair against the wall and not move or talk."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 29115    window = 29110 29120


"Yes, it's a gun, recently fired, and not mine or Wolfe's. Is it yours? No? Good. Okay, keep your shirt on. We're going back in there, and there will be sufficient employment for my brain without interference from you. Do not try to help me. See how long you can go without speaking a word. Just look wise as if you knew it all. If this ends as it ought to, you'll get an extra hundred. Agreed?"
I'll be damned if he didn't say, "Two hundred. I was shot at. I came within an inch of getting killed."
I told him he'd have to talk the second hundred out of Wolfe and opened the door to the office and followed him through. He detoured around Jane Geer and went and sat in the chair he had just escaped being a corpse in. I swiveled my own chair to face it out and sat down too.
Jensen demanded sharply, "What have you got there?"

==> This," I said cheerfully, "is a veteran revolver, a Granville thirty-eight, which has been fired not too long ago." I lowered it gently onto my desk. "Fritz, give me back my gun." He brought it. I kept it in my hand. <==
"Thank you. I found this other affair in the vase on the table in there, dressed in a handkerchief. Five unused cartridges and one used. It's a stranger here. Never saw it before. It appears to put the finishing touch on a critical situation."
Jane exploded. She cabled me an unspeakable rat. She said she wanted a lawyer and intended to go to one immediately. She called Hackett three or four things. She said it was the dirtiest frame-up in history. "Now," she told Hackett, "I know damned well you framed Peter Root. I let that skunk Goodwin talk me out of it!"
She was out of her chair, spitting fire. It was spectacular. "You won't get away with it this time! You incredible louse!"
Hackett was trying to talk back to her, making his voice louder and louder, and when she stopped for breath he could be heard.
"... will not tolerate it;! You come here and try to kill me! You nearly do kill me! Then you abuse me about a Peter Root and I have never heard of Peter Root!" He was putting real feeling into it; apparently he had either forgotten that he was supposed to be Nero Wolfe, or had got the notion, in all the excitement, that he really was Nero Wolfe. He was proceeding, "Young lady, listen to me! I will not -"

"We'll keep the handkerchief," Wolfe said.
Jensen demanded, "What the devil is it doing there?"
Wolfe's eyes went shut. He was, of course, tasting Jensen's expression, tone of voice, and mental longitude and latitude, to try to decide whether innocent curiosity was indicated or a camouflage for guilt. He always shut his eyes when he tasted. In a moment they opened again halfway.
"If a man has recently shot a gun," he said, "and has had no opportunity to wash, an examination of his hand will furnish incontestable proof. You probably know that. One of you, the one who fired that shot, certainly does. The handkerchief protected the hand. Under a microscope it would be found to contain many minute particles of explosive and other residue. The fact that it is a man's handkerchief doesn't help. Major Jensen would naturally possess a man's handkerchief. If Miss Geer decided to use a handkerchief in that manner, naturally she wouldn't use a woman's handkerchief. anyway, it wouldn't be big enough."
"You asked me to stay while you said something," Jane snapped. She and Jensen were back in their chairs. "You haven't said anything yet. Where were you when the shot was fired?"
==> "Pfui." Wolfe sighed. "Fritz, pack the gun and bullet in a carton, carefully with tissue paper, and give it to the man when he comes. First bring me beer. Do any of you want beer?" <==
Evidently no one did.
"Very well. Miss Geer. To assume, or pretend to assume some elaborate hocus- pocus by the inmates of this house is inane. At the moment the shot was fired I was standing near the kitchen talking with Mr. Goodwin. Since then I have been at a spot from which part of this room can be seen and voices heard."
His eyes went to Jensen and back to Jane. "One of you two people is apt to make a mistake, and I want to prevent it if possible. I have not yet asked you where you were and what you were doing at the instant the shot was fired. Before I do so I want to say this, that even with the information at hand it is demonstrable

 that the shot came from the direction of that door to the front room, which was standing open. Mr. Hackett could not have fired it; you, Mr. Jensen, satisfied yourself of that. Mr. Brenner was in the kitchen. Mr. Goodwin and I were together. I warn you - one of you - that this is sufficiently provable to satisfy a jury in a murder trial. Now what if you both assert that at the instant you heard the shot you were together, close together perhaps, looking at each other? For the one who fired the gun that would be a blessing indeed. For the other it might be disastrous in the end; for when the truth is disclosed, as it will be, the question of complicity will arise. How long have you two known each other?"

"I still say," Jensen still said, "that it's a damned farce."
"Even so, sir, you're one of the cast. Surely it is risking little to tell me where - "
"I was in the doorway to the hall, looking down the hall and wondering where Goodwin had gone to. For no particular reason. I was not at that precise moment looking at Miss Geer. But I regard it as - "
==> "That won't help me any. How you regard it. And I doubt if it will help you." Wolfe poured beer, which Fritz had brought. "Now we are ready to decide something." <==
He took them both in. "Miss Geer, you said you wanted to go to a lawyer, heaven protect you. But it would not be sensible to permit either of you to walk out of here, to move and act at your own will and discretion. Since that bullet was intended for me, I reject the notion utterly. On the other hand, we can't proceed intelligently until I get a report from Mr. Cramer. There is time to be passed. You can - "
Jane got up. "I'm going."
"One moment. You can either pass it here, in company with Mr. Goodwin and his gun, or I can phone Mr. Cramer, giving him an outline of the situation, and he can send men to get you. Which do you prefer?"
Jane was doing slow motion toward the door. She didn't exactly take a step; it was more as if something was pulling her that way without her doing anything about it. I called to her without leaving my chair, "Listen, honey, I wouldn't shoot you for a nickel, but I can easy catch you before you get out the front door and this time I'll wrap you up good."
She flung it at me: "Rat!"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 469    window = 464 474

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 29193    window = 29188 29198


"No."
"Good. That's sensible. Miss Geer?"
She wasn't conversing. Wolfe waited patiently for four seconds.
"Shall I phone the police, Miss Geer?"
Her head went from side to side in a negative, the way she had moved toward the door, as if someone or something was doing it for her.
==> Wolfe heaved a sigh. "Archie, take them to the front room and stay there till I send for you. Fritz will answer the bell. I am aware that it will be tiresome, but there's no help for it." <==
VIII
Yes, it got tiresome, lasting as it did a full two hours. at first I got some diversion out of the fact that Jane and Jensen showed no inclination to sit side by side on the sofa and hold hands. God knows where Wolfe had ever found that sofa and the velvet cushions; it had been there when I had first arrived. One or the other of them did sit on it now and again during their restless moving around, but not the two together. Wolfe's poison had done its work. It was interesting to watch it.
The one who had not fired the gun had got suspicious of the other one; and the other one, seeing that, obviously had figured that if he or she tried to be cordial on the basis of what the hell, darling, we couldn't be murderers, could we, it would be a giveaway, because the one would be thinking, If I'm suspicious why isn't he or she?

==> Naturally I watched for something, any kind of sign, from which I could get a notion who was the one and who was the other, but now I leaned one way and now the other, and got nowhere. at seven-thirty we were all invited to the dining- room, but they wouldn't go. When Fritz brought trays in to us I had no trouble dealing with my share of melon, broiled pork loin wafers, salad with Wolfe's own dressing, blueberry pie, and coffee, and Jensen was with me nose and nose, but Jane wouldn't even look at hers. <==
I was, I admit, in no condition to place a bet, even to risk as much as a busted shoestring. The only way I could have solved the problem would have been to blindfold myself and whichever one I touched first was it. Anyway, I was licked before I started, because bold and daring, which were words Wolfe had used, was putting it mildly. He or she had of course arrived at the house with the gun ready, dressed in the handkerchief, in pocket or handbag, but only with the idea of using it if opportunity offered, for it couldn't possibly have been planned just as it happened. For split-second decision and action I had never seen anything to equal it. Entered the room. Saw, through the open door, Wolfe (supposedly) seated at his desk. Got hand on gun, protected by handkerchief. Waited. Instant came, in about a minute, when Wolfe's eyes were closed or he was looking elsewhere, and also, simultaneously, the other one was either looking in the hall or was at the piano with back turned, depending on who was who. Aimed and fired. When the other one glanced in all directions, that provided the chance to put the gun in the vase.
The devil of it was, try to crack it. Unless you could make it fairly overwhelming by way of motive or possession of the gun or something else from the buildup, how were you going to get a jury to convict either of them? Not to mention the little item that what was really wanted was conviction not for felonious assault on Hackett, but for the murder of Jensen and Doyle. during the two hours I spoke to Jane three times, at well-spaced intervals, as follows:
1. "Do you want a drink of water or something?"
2. "There's a door to that bathroom from this room too. Over there. The one from the bathroom to the office is now locked."
3. "I beg your pardon." That was for a yawn.

2. "There's a door to that bathroom from this room too. Over there. The one from the bathroom to the office is now locked."

She neither spoke to me nor looked at me. Jensen was about as bad. I don't

==>  remember any two hours in my experience with a lower score on joviality. So I appreciated the break in the monotony when, a little before nine, I heard the doorbell. Since the door from the front room to the hall was also soundproof, that was all I got out of it except for the faint vibration of footsteps and an even fainter sound of voices. But in about three minutes the door to the hall opened and Fritz came in. He shut the door behind him and spoke, not very loud. <==
"Archie, Mr. Wolfe wants you in the office. Inspector Cramer is there with Sergeant Stebbins. I am to stay here."
He held out his hand for the gun. I gave it to him and went.
If the situation in the front room had been unjovial, the one in the office was absolutely grim. One glance at Wolfe was enough to see that he was in a state of uncontrollable fury, because his forefinger was making the same circle, over and over, on the surface of his desk. Sergeant Purley Stebbins was standing by the wall, looking official. Inspector Cramer was in the red leather chair, with his face about the color of the chair.
Nobody bothered to glance at me. Wolfe snapped, "Your notebook."
I crossed to my desk and got book and pencil and sat down. "This," I observed, "is what comes of my not attending to the doorbell. If we didn't want company - "

"Not any. I have only one concern in this. I have no client. I withheld nothing and added nothing."
"Maybe." Cramer straightened up like a man of action. "Okay, we'll proceed on that basis and find out. First of all, I want to ask them some questions."
"I suppose you do." Wolfe detested sitting and listening to someone else ask questions, especially in his own office. "And Miss Geer is going to be difficult. She wants a lawyer. You are handicapped, of course, by your official status. Which one do you want first?"
Cramer stood up. "I've got to see that room before I talk to either of them. I want to see where things are. Especially that vase."
I was amazed to see that Wolfe was leaving his chair too, knowing his attitude toward all nonessential movement, but as I went to open the door to the front room for them I reflected that while he hated hearing Cramer ask questions, under the circumstances he would hate even more not hearing him, in case conversation got started in the front room. Stebbins tagged in after them, and I brought up the rear.
==> Jane was seated on the piano bench. Jensen was on the sofa, but arose as we entered. Fritz was standing by a window, his hand with the gun coming up as Jensen moved. <==
Wolfe said, "This is Inspector Cramer, Miss Geer."
She didn't make a sound or move a muscle.
Wolfe said, "I believe you've met the inspector, Mr. Jensen."

"Yes, I have." Jensen's voice had gone unused so long it squeaked, and he cleared his throat. "So the agreement not to call in the police was a farce too." He was bitter.
"There was no such agreement. I said that Mr. Cramer couldn't be kept out of it indefinitely. The bullet that was fired at me - at Mr. Hackett - came from the gun that was found in that vase" - Wolfe pointed at it - "and so did those that killed your father and Mr. Doyle. So the field has become - ah, restricted."
"I insist," Jane put in, in a voice with no resemblance to any I had ever heard her use before, "on my right to consult a lawyer."
"Just a minute now," Cramer told her in the tone he thought was soothing. "We're going to talk this over, but wait till I look around a little." He proceeded to inspect things, and so did Sergeant Stebbins. They considered distances, and the positions of various objects. Then there was this detail: from what segment of that room could a gun send a bullet through the open door to the office and on through the hole in Wolfe's chair and the one in the wall?
==> They were working on that together when Wolfe turned to Fritz and asked him, "What happened to the other cushion?" <==
Fritz was taken aback. "Other cushion?"
"There were six velvet cushions on that sofa. There are only five. Did you remove it?"
"No, sir." Fritz gazed at the sofa and counted.
"That's right. They've been rearranged to take up the space. I don't understand it. They were all here yesterday when I cleaned in here."
"Are you sure of that?"

"Look for it. Archie, help him. I want to know if that cushion is in this room."
It seemed like an odd moment to send out a general alarm for a sofa cushion, but since I had nothing else to do at the moment I obliged. Cramer and Purley went

==>  on solving a murder and Fritz and I went on hunting the cushion. Jensen watched both operations. Wolfe watched only one - Fritz's and mine. Jane pretended there was no one in the room but her. <==
I finally told Wolfe, "It's gone. It isn't in here." He muttered at me, "I see it isn't."
I stared at him. There was an expression on his face that I knew well. It wasn't exactly excitement, though it always stirred excitement in me. His neck was rigid, as if to prevent any movement of the head, so as not to disturb the brain, his eyes were half shut and not seeing anything, and his lips were moving, pushing out, then relaxing, then pushing out again. I knew it would take more than the loss of a velvet cushion to produce that effect on him. I stared at him.
Suddenly he turned and spoke. "Mr. Cramer! Please leave Mr. Stebbins in here with Miss Geer and Mr. Jensen. You can stay here too, or come with me, as you prefer. Fritz and Archie, come." He headed for the office. Cramer, knowing Wolfe's tones of voice almost as well as I did, spoke to Stebbins and then followed. Fritz and I also followed. So did Jane's voice.
"This is outrageous! I want - " I shut the door.
Wolfe waited until he was in his chair before he spoke. "I want to know if that cushion is on the premises. Search the house from the cellar up - except the south room; Mr. Hackett is in there lying down. Start in here." Cramer barked, "What the hell is all this about?"

"I'll give you an explanation," Wolfe told him, "when I have one. I'm going to sit here and work and must not be disturbed. It may take ten minutes; it may take ten hours. Go in there; stay here; go anywhere, but let me alone."
He leaned back and closed his eyes, and his lips started moving. Cramer slid farther back in his chair, crossed his legs, got out a cigar and sank his teeth in it.
Searching the office was quite different from searching the front room. In the first place, it was a lot bigger. Also, there were a lot more places where you could hide a cushion - files, drawers, bookshelves, magazine and newspaper

Searching the office was quite different from searching the front room. In the first place, it was a lot bigger. Also, there were a lot more places where you could hide a cushion - files, drawers, bookshelves, magazine and newspaper

 racks, cabinets, miscellaneous. It had a high ceiling, and the steps had to be used for all the upper shelves and file and cabinet compartments.
==> None of them could be ruled out, because the shelves were deep, and it was no trivial job to pull out all those books and slide them back again. Fritz went at it with his usual deliberate thoroughness, and I couldn't have been called a whirlwind either because I was using my brain along with my hands, trying to work out how and why the fact of a missing cushion crashed into the structure like a comet shattering a world. Now and then a glance at Wolfe showed me that he was still working, his lips moving and his eyes shut. <==
Half an hour or so had passed, maybe a little more, when I heard him let out a grunt. I nearly toppled off the steps, turning to look at him. He was in motion. He picked up his wastebasket, which was kept at the far corner of his desk, held it so that the light shone directly into it, inspected it, shook his head, put it down again, and began opening the drawers of his desk, all the way out, and inspecting their interiors, starting with the top one on the right side. The first two, the one at the top and the one in the middle, apparently didn't get him anything, but when he yanked out the double-depth one at the bottom as far as it would go, he looked in, bent over closer to see better, stuck a hand in and seemed to be poking around, closed the drawer, got himself erect, and announced:
"I've found it."
In those three little words there was at least two tons of self-satisfaction and smirk.
We all goggled at him.
He looked at me. "Archie. Get down off that thing and don't fall. Look in your desk and see if one of my guns has been fired."
