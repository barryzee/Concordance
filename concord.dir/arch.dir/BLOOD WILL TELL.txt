REX STOUT
==> NATURALLY MOST OF THE ITEMS in the mail that is delivered to the old brownstone on West 35th Street are addressed to Nero Wolfe, but since I both work and live there eight or ten out of a hundred are addressed to me. It is my custom to let my share wait until after I have opened Wolfe’s, looked it over, and put it on his desk, but sometimes curiosity butts in. As it did that Tuesday morning when I came to an elegant cream-colored envelope, outsize, addressed to me on a typewriter, with the return address in the corner engraved in dark brown: <==
JAMES NEVILLE VANCE
Two Nineteen Horn Street New York 12 New York
Never heard of him. It wasn’t flat; it bulged with something soft inside. Like everybody else, I occasionally get envelopes containing samples of something that bulges them, but not expensive envelopes with engraving that isn’t phony. So I slit it open and removed the contents. A folded sheet of paper that matched the envelope, including the engraved name and address, had a message typed in the center:
Archie Goodwin - Keep this until you hear from me. JNV
"This" was a necktie, a four-in-hand, neatly folded to go in the envelope. I stretched it out - long, narrow, maybe silk, light tan, almost the same color as the stationery, with thin brown diagonal lines. A Sutcliffe label, so certainly silk, say twenty bucks. But he should have sent it to the cleaners instead of me, because it had a spot, a big one two inches long, near one end, about the same tone of brown as the thin lines; but the lines’ brown was clean and live and the spot’s brown was dirty and dead. I sniffed at it, but I am not a beagle. Having seen a few dried bloodstains here and there, I knew the dirty color was right, but that’s

 no phenolphthalin test. Even so, I told myself as I dropped the tie in a drawer, supposing that James Neville Vance worked in a butcher shop and forgot his bib, why pick on me? As I closed the drawer I shrugged.
==> That’s the way to take it when you get a bloodstained (maybe) necktie in the mail from a stranger, just shrug, but I admit that in the next couple of hours I did something and didn’t do something else. What I did do was ring Lon Cohen at the Gazette to ask a question, and an hour later he called back to say that James Neville Vance, now in his late fifties, still owned all the real estate he had inherited from his father, still spent winters on the Riviera, and was still a bachelor; and what did he want of a private detective? I reserved that. What I didn’t do was take a walk. When nothing is stirring and Wolfe has given me no program I usually go out after the routine morning chores to work my legs and have a look at the town and my fellow men, not to mention women, but that morning I skipped it because JNV might come or phone. It had been an honest shrug, but you can’t shrug all day. <==
I might as well have had my walk because the phone call didn’t come until a quarter past eleven, after Wolfe had come down to the office from his two-hour morning session with the orchids up in the plant rooms on the roof. He had put a spray of Cymbidium Doris in the vase on his desk and got his personal seventh of a ton disposed in his oversize custom-made chair, and was scowling at the dust jacket of a book, one of the items that had been addressed to him, when the phone rang and I got it.
"Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie Goodwin speaking." "Is this Archie Goodwin?"
Three people out of ten will do that. I am always tempted to say no, it’s a trained dog, and see what comes next, but I might get barked at. So I said, "It is. In person."
"This is James Neville Vance. Did you receive something in the mail from me?"
His voice couldn’t decide whether to be a squeak or a falsetto and had the worst features of both. "Yes, presumably," I said. "Your envelope and letterhead."

"And an enclosure." "Right."


"Please destroy it. Burn it. I intended - But what I intended doesn’t matter now... I was mistaken. Burn it. I’m sorry to have bothered you."
He hung up.
==> I cradled the phone and swiveled. Wolfe had opened the book to the title page and was eying it with the same kind of look a man I know has for a pretty girl he has just met. <==
"If I may interrupt," I said. "Since there’s nothing urgent in the mail I have an errand, personal or professional, I don’t know which." I got the envelope, letterhead, and enclosure from the drawer, rose, and handed them to him. "If that spot on the tie is blood, my theory was that someone stabbed or shot James Neville Vance and got rid of the corpse all right but didn’t know what to do with the tie, so he sent it to me, but that phone call was a bagpipe saying he was James Neville Vance, and he had been mistaken, and I would please burn what he had sent me by mail. So evidently - "
"A bagpipe?"
"I merely meant he squeaked. So evidently he couldn’t burn it himself because he didn’t have a match, and now he’s impersonating James Neville Vance, who owns - or owned - various gobs of real estate, and it is my duty as a citizen and a licensed private detective to expose and denounce - "
"Pfui. Some floundering numskull."
"Okay. I’ll go out back to burn it. It’ll smell." He grunted. "It may not be blood."

It was a baritone, no trace of a squeak. I told the grill, "I have something that belongs to you and I want to return it."
"You have something that belongs to me?" "Right."
"What is it and where did you get it?"
"Correction. I think it belongs to you. It’s a four-in-hand silk tie, Sutcliffe label, the same color as this house, with diagonal lines the same color as the trim. Cream and brown."
"Who are you and where did you get it?"
==> I got impatient. "Here’s a suggestion," I said. "Install closed-circuit television so you can see the vestibule from up there, and phone me at the office of Nero Wolfe, where I work, and I’ll come back. It will take a week or so and set you back ten grand, but it’ll be worth it to see the tie without letting me in. After you’ve identified it I’ll tell you where I got it. If you don’t - " <==
"Did you say Nero Wolfe? The detective?"


"Yes."
"But what - This is ridiculous."

"Yes."

"I agree. Completely. Give me a ring when you’re ready."

"Yes."
"But what - This is ridiculous."
"I agree. Completely. Give me a ring when you’re ready."
"But I - All right. Use the elevator. I’m in the studio, the top floor - four."
==> There was a click at the door, and on the third click I pushed it open and entered. To my surprise the small hall was not more cream and brown but a deep rich red with black panel-borders, and the door of the do-it-yourself elevator was stainless steel. When I pushed the button and the door opened, and, inside, pushed the 4 button and was lifted, there was practically no noise or vibration - very different from the one in the old brownstone which Wolfe always used and I never did. <==
Stepping out when the door opened, I got another surprise. Since he had called it the studio I was expecting to smell turpentine and see a clutter of vintage Vances, but at first glance it was a piano warehouse. There were three of them in the big room, which was the length and width of the house.
The man standing there waited to speak until my glance got to him. Undersized, with too much chin for his neat smooth face, no wrinkles, he wasn’t as impressive as his stationery, but his clothes were - cream-colored silk shirt and brown made-to-fit slacks. He cocked his head, nodded, and said, "I recognize you. I’ve seen you at the Flamingo." He came a step. "What’s this about a tie? Let me see it."
"It’s the one you sent me," I said.
He frowned. "The one I sent you?"
"There seems to be a gap," I said. "Are you James Neville Vance?" "I am. Certainly."

"It must be mine. I can settle that. Come along."
He headed for the rear and I followed, back beyond the second piano, and then down spiral stairs, wide for a spiral, with carpeted steps and a polished wooden rail. At the bottom, the rear end of a good-sized living room, he turned right through an open door and we were in a bedroom. He crossed to another door and opened it, and I stopped two steps off. It was a walk-in closet. A friend of mine once told me that a woman’s clothes closet will tell you more about her than any other room in the house, and if that goes for a man too there was my chance to get the lowdown on James Neville Vance, but I was interested only in his neckties. They were on a rack at the right, three rows of them, quite an assortment, some cream and brown but by no means all. He fingered through part of one row, repeated it, turned and emerged, and said, "It’s mine. I had nine and gave one to somebody, and there are only seven." He shook his head. "I can’t imagine ..." He let it hang. "What on earth ..." He let that hang too.
"And your stationery," I said.
"Yes. Of course."
"And the phone call telling me to burn it. With a squeak." "Yes. You asked if I had any ideas or suggestions. Have you?"
==> "I could have, but they would be expensive. I work for Nero Wolfe and it would be on his time, and the bill would be bad news. You must know who has access to your stationery and that closet, and you ought to be able to make some kind of a guess about who and why. And you won’t need the tie. It came to me in the mail, so actually and legally it’s in my possession, and I ought to keep it." I put a hand out. "If you don’t mind?" <==
"Of course." He handed it over. "But I might - You’re not going to burn it?"
"No indeed." I stuck it in my side pocket. The envelope and letterhead were back in my breast pocket. "I have a little collection of souvenirs. If and when you have occasion to produce it for - "
A bell tinkled somewhere, a soft music tinkle, possibly music of the future. He frowned and turned and started for the front, and I followed, back through the

 open door, and across the living room to another door, which he opened. Two men were there in a little foyer - one a square little guy in shirt sleeves and brown denim pants, and the other, also square but big, a harness bull.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 73928    window = 73923 73933


"Ring before you - I’d better come." He crossed the sill and when I was out closed the door. Four of us in the elevator didn’t leave much room. When it stopped at 2 and they stepped out I stepped out too, into another small foyer. Vance pressed a button on a doorjamb, waited half a minute, pressed it again, kept his finger on it for five seconds, and waited some more. "All right, Bert," he said and moved aside. Bert put a key in the lock - a Rabson, I noticed - turned it, turned the knob, pushed the door open, and made room for Vance to enter. Then the cop, and then me. Two steps in, Vance stopped, faced the rear, and raised his baritone. "Bonny! It’s Jim!"
I saw it first, a blue slipper on its side on the floor with a foot in it, extending beyond the edge of a couch. I moved automatically but stopped short. Let the

 cop do his own discovering. He did; he saw it too and went; and when he had passed the end of the couch he stopped shorter than I had, growled, "Godalmighty," and stood looking down. Then I moved, and so did Vance. When Vance saw it, all of it, he went stiff, gawking, then he made a sort of choking noise, and then he crumpled. It wasn’t a faint; his knees just quit on him and he went down, and no wonder. Even live blood on a live face makes an impression, and when the face is dead and the blood has dried all over one side and the ear, plenty of it, you do need knees.
I don’t say I wasn’t impressed, but my problem wasn’t knees. It took me maybe six seconds to decide. Bert had joined us and was reacting. Vance had grabbed the back of the couch to pull himself up. The cop was squatting for a close-up of the dead face. No one knew if I was there or not, and in another six seconds I wasn’t. I went to the door, easy, let myself out, took the elevator down, and on out to the sidewalk. A police car was double-parked right in front, and the cop at the wheel, seeing me emerge from that house, gave me an eye but let it go at that as I headed west. Approaching Sixth Avenue, I felt sweat trickling down onto my cheek and got out my handkerchief. The sun was at the top on a warm August day, but I don’t sweat when I’m walking, and besides, why didn’t I know it before it collected enough to trickle? There you are. One man’s knees buckle immediately and another man starts sweating five minutes later and doesn’t know it.
==> It was a quarter to one when I climbed out of a taxi in front of the old brownstone on West 35th Street, mounted the seven steps of the stoop, and used my key. Before proceeding down the hall to the office I used my handkerchief thoroughly; Wolfe, who misses nothing, had never seen me sweat and wouldn’t now. When I entered he was at his desk with the new book, and he took his eyes from it barely enough for a sidewise glance at me as I crossed to my desk. I sat and said, "I don’t like to interrupt, but I have a report." <==
He grunted. "Is it necessary?"
"It’s desirable. There’s nearly half an hour till lunch, and if someone comes, for instance an officer of the law, it would be better if you knew about it."
He let the book down a little. "What the devil are you into now?"
"That’s the report. Ten minutes will do it, fifteen at the outside, even verbatim."

I started in, verbatim, and by the time I was telling Vance he should install closed-circuit television he was leaning back with his eyes closed. Merely force of habit. When I mentioned the title of the privately printed book he made a noise - he says all music is a vestige of barbarism - and when I came to the end he snorted and opened his eyes.
"I don’t believe it," he said flatly. "You’ve omitted something. A death by violence, and, not involved and with no commitment, you left? Nonsense." He straightened up.
I nodded. "You’re not interested and you don’t intend to be, so you didn’t bother to look at it. I was present at the discovery of a dead body, obviously murdered. If I had hung around I would have been stuck. In another minute the cop would have ordered us to stay put, and he would have taken my name and recognized it. When Homicide came, probably Stebbins but no matter who, he would have learned why I was there, if not from me, then from Vance, and he would have taken the envelope and letterhead and necktie, and I wanted them for souvenirs. As I told Vance, they are actually and legally in my possession."
"Pfui."
"I disagree. Of course I would have liked to stay long enough to get a sample of that blood to have it compared with the spot on the tie. If it was the same I would be the first to know it and it’s nice to be first. Also of course, Vance will tell them about me, and the question is can I be hooked for obstructing justice if I refuse to hand over the tie? I don’t see how; There’s nothing to connect it with the homicide until and unless her blood is compared with the spot."
==> Wolfe granted. "Flummery. Provoking the police is permissible only when it serves a purpose." <==
"Certainly. And if James Neville Vance comes or calls to say that he expects to be charged with the murder of Mrs. Kirk, if that’s who she was, partly because of the tie he didn’t send me, and he wants to hire you, wouldn’t it be convenient to have the tie? And the envelope and letterhead?"
"I have no expectation of being engaged by Mr. Vance. Nor desire."
"Sure. Because you would have to work. I remarked yesterday that the gross take

 for the first seven months of nineteen sixty-two is nine grand behind nineteen sixty-one. I am performing one of the main functions you pay me for."

 for the first seven months of nineteen sixty-two is nine grand behind nineteen sixty-one. I am performing one of the main functions you pay me for."
"Not brilliantly," he said and picked up the book. Merely a childish gesture, since Fritz would enter in eight minutes to announce lunch. I went and opened the safe and stashed my souvenirs on a shelf in the inner compartment.
43
INSPECTOR CRAMER of Homicide South came at ten minutes past six.
==> I had been functioning all afternoon, I don’t say brilliantly. During lunch, in the dining room across the hall, while listening to Wolfe’s table talk with one ear, I decided to make myself scarce while I considered the matter. There was no sense in getting out on a limb just for the hell of it, and a homicide dick might show any minute, so as we left the table I told Wolfe that since we had no expectations or desires I was going out on some personal chores. He gave me a sharp glance, made a face, and headed for the office. As I was turning to the front the phone rang and I went in and got it. If it was the DA’s office inviting me to call, I would make up my mind on the way downtown. <==
It was Lon Cohen. He had compliments. "No question about it, Archie," he said, "you’d be worth your weight in blood rubies to any newspaper in town, especially the Gazette. At nine-thirty you phone for dope on James Neville Vance. At twelve-twenty, less than three hours later, a cop finds a body in his house and both you and he are present. Marvelous. Any leg man can find out what happened, but knowing what’s going to happen - you’re one in ten million. What’s on the program for tomorrow? I only want a day at a time."
I was a little short with him because my problem was the program for today.
I was out of the house and halfway to Eighth Avenue, no destination in mind, when I realized I was ignoring the main point - no, two main points. One, if a dick came before Wolfe went up to the plant rooms at four o’clock, Wolfe might possibly give him the souvenirs, to keep me out of trouble. Two, if the spot on the tie wasn’t blood and its being sent to me was just some kind of a gag, and it had no connection with a murder, I was stewing about nothing. So I turned and went back. Wolfe, at his desk with his book, apparently paid no attention as I opened the safe and took out the souvenirs, but of course he saw. I pocketed

 them and left.

Twenty minutes later I was seated in a room on the tenth floor of a building on 43rd Street, telling a man at a desk, "This is for me personally, Mr. Hirsh, not for Mr. Wolfe, but it’s possible that he may have a use for it before long." I put the tie on the desk and pointed to the spot. "How long will it take to tell what that is?"
He bent his head for a look without touching it. "Maybe ten minutes, maybe a week."
"How long will it take to tell if it’s blood?"

At nine-thirty you phone for dope on James Neville Vance. At twelve-twenty, less than three hours later, a cop finds a body in his house and both you and he are present. Marvelous. Any leg man can find out what happened, but knowing what’s going to happen - you’re one in ten million. What’s on the program for tomorrow? I only want a day at a time."
I was a little short with him because my problem was the program for today.
I was out of the house and halfway to Eighth Avenue, no destination in mind, when I realized I was ignoring the main point - no, two main points. One, if a dick came before Wolfe went up to the plant rooms at four o’clock, Wolfe might possibly give him the souvenirs, to keep me out of trouble. Two, if the spot on the tie wasn’t blood and its being sent to me was just some kind of a gag, and it had no connection with a murder, I was stewing about nothing. So I turned and went back. Wolfe, at his desk with his book, apparently paid no attention as I opened the safe and took out the souvenirs, but of course he saw. I pocketed

 them and left.
==> Twenty minutes later I was seated in a room on the tenth floor of a building on 43rd Street, telling a man at a desk, "This is for me personally, Mr. Hirsh, not for Mr. Wolfe, but it’s possible that he may have a use for it before long." I put the tie on the desk and pointed to the spot. "How long will it take to tell what that is?" <==
He bent his head for a look without touching it. "Maybe ten minutes, maybe a week."
"How long will it take to tell if it’s blood?"
He got a glass from a drawer and took another look. "It’s a fairly fresh stain. That it isn’t blood, negative for hemoglobin, ten minutes. That it is blood, thirty or forty minutes. That it is or isn’t human blood, up to ninety minutes, maybe less. To type it with certainty if it’s human, at least five hours."
"I only need yes or no on the human. Would you have to ruin the whole spot?" "Oh, no. Just a few threads."
"Okay, I’ll wait. As I say, it’s not for Mr. Wolfe, but I’ll appreciate it very much. I’ll be in the anteroom."

"You might as well wait here." He rose, with the tie. "I’ll have to do it myself. It’s vacation time and we’re shorthanded."
An hour and a half later, at twenty minutes to five, I was in a down elevator, the tie back in my pocket minus only a few threads. It was human blood, and the stain was less than a week old, probably much less. So I wasn’t in a stew for nothing, but now what? Of course I could go back to the office and try for fingerprints on the envelope and letterhead, but that would have been just passing time since I had nothing to compare them with. Or I could phone James Neville Vance, tell him what the spot was, and ask if he now had any ideas or suggestions, but that would have been pushing it, since I didn’t know whether he had told the cops why I was there.
Considering, as I emerged to the sidewalk, how little I did know, next to nothing, that it was either go home and sit on it or learn something somehow, and that the

Gazette building was only a five-minute walk, I turned east at 44th Street. Lon Cohen’s room is on the twentieth floor, two doors down the hall from the corner office of the publisher. When I walked in, having been announced, he was at one of the three phones on his desk, and I sat. When he hung up he swiveled and said, "No welcome. If you were a real pal you would have told me this morning and we could have had a photographer there."

As for today, Kirk had phoned police headquarters a little before noon, saying that he had dialed his wife’s number six times in eighteen hours and got no answer; that he had gone to the house around eleven o’clock, got no response to his ring from the vestibule, used his key to get in, pushed the button at the apartment door repeatedly and heard the bell, without result, and departed without entering; and that he wanted the police to take a look. He had been asked to be there to let a cop use his key but had declined.


Bonny Kirk had last been seen alive, to present knowledge, by a man from a package store who had delivered a bottle of vodka to her at the apartment door, and been paid by her, a little before one o’clock Monday afternoon. The unopened vodka bottle, found under the couch with blood on it, had been used to smash Bonny Kirk’s skull sometime between one P.M. and eight P.M. Monday, the latter limit having been supplied by the medical examiner.
Among those who had been summoned or escorted to the DA’s office were Martin Kirk, James Neville Vance, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Fougere, and Bert Odom, the janitor. Presumably some of them, perhaps all, were still there.
==> For all that and a lot more I’m leaving out I didn’t owe Lon anything, since on our give-and-take record to date I had a credit balance, and I didn’t mention the necktie. Of course he wanted to know who Wolfe’s client was and what about Vance, and it never hurts to have Wolfe’s name in the paper, not to mention mine, but since the whole point was that Wolfe was short on clients I decided to save it. Naturally he didn’t believe it, that Wolfe had no client, and when I got up to go he said, "No welcome and no fare you well either." <==
I took a taxi because Wolfe likes to find me in the office when he comes down from the plant rooms at six o’clock, and he pays me and I had spent the day on personal chores, but with the traffic at that hour I might as well have walked, and it was ten past six when the hackie finally made it. As I was climbing out, a car I recognized pulled up just behind, and as I stood a man I also recognized got out of it - a big solid specimen with a big red face topped by an old felt hat even on a hot August day. As he approached I greeted him, "I’ll be damned. You yourself?"
Ignoring me, he called to my hackie, "Where did you get this fare?" Apparently the hackie recognized Inspector Cramer of Homicide South, for he called back, "Forty-second and Lexington, Inspector."
"All right, move on." To me: "We’ll go in."
I shook my head. "I’ll save you the trouble. Mr. Wolfe has a new book and there’s no point in annoying him. The tie was mailed to me, not him, and he knows nothing about it and doesn’t want to."
"I’d rather get that from him. Come on."

Nothing doing. He’s sore enough as it is, and so am I. I’ve wasted a day. I’ve learned that the spot on the tie is human blood, but what - "
"How did you learn that?"
"I had it tested at a laboratory."

"Nuts. Evidence of what? Even with blood it’s not evidence if it isn’t the same type as the victim’s. As for leaving the scene, I wasn’t concerned and no one told me to stay. As for tampering, it’s still a perfectly good spot with just a few threads gone. I had to know if it was blood because if it wasn’t I was going to keep it, and if a court ordered me to fork it over I would have fought it. I wanted to find out who had sent it to me and why, and I still do. But since it’s blood I couldn’t fight an order." I got the souvenirs from my pockets. "Here. When you’re through with them I want them back."
"You do." He took them and looked them over. "There’s a typewriter in Vance’s place. Did you take a sample from it for comparison?"
"You know damn well I didn’t, since he has told you what I said and did."
"He could forget. Is this the tie you got in the mail this morning and is this the envelope it came in?"
"Yes. Now that’s an idea. I could have got another set from Vance. I wish I’d thought of it."
==> "You could have. I know you. I’m taking you down, but we’ll go in first. I want to ask Wolfe a question." <==
"I’m not going in, and one will get you ten you won’t get in. He’s not interested and doesn’t intend to be. I could come down after dinner. We’re having lobsters, simmered in white wine with tarragon, and a white wine sauce with the tomalley and coral - "
"I’m taking you." He aimed a thumb at the car. "Get in."

I GOT HOME well after midnight and before going up two flights to bed hit the refrigerator for leftover lobster and a glass of milk, to remove both hunger and the taste of the excuse for bread and stringy corned beef I had been supplied with at the DA’s office.
Since my connection with their homicide had been short and simple, the twenty seconds I had spent in the Kirk apartment, and my connection with Vance hadn’t been a lot longer, an hour of me should have been more than enough, including typing the statement for me to sign, and it wasn’t until after nine o’clock that I realized, from a question by Assistant DA Mandel, what the idea was. They actually thought that the tie thing might be some kind of dodge that I had been in on, and they were keeping me until they got a report on the stain. So I cooled down and took it easy, got on speaking terms with a dick who was put in a room with me to see that I didn’t jump out a window, got him to produce a deck for some friendly gin, and in two hours managed to lose $4.70. I called time at that point and paid him because he was getting sleepy and it would have been next to impossible to keep him ahead.
I got my money’s worth. Around midnight someone came and called him out, and when he returned ten minutes later and said I was no longer needed I gave him a friendly grin, a good loser, no hard feelings, and said, "So the blood’s the same type, huh?" And he nodded and said, "Yeah, modern science is wonderful."
==> So, I told myself as I got the lobster out, I got not only my money’s worth but my time’s worth, and by the time I was upstairs and in my pajamas I had decided that if Wolfe wasn’t interested I certainly was, and I was going to find out who had sent me that tie even if I had to take a month’s leave of absence. <==
Except in emergencies I get a full eight hours’ sleep, and that was merely a project, not an emergency, so I didn’t get down for breakfast, which I eat in the kitchen, until after ten o’clock. As I got orange juice from the refrigerator and Fritz started the burner under the cake griddle he asked where I had dined, and I said he knew darned well I hadn’t dined at all, since I had phoned that I was at the DA’s office, and he nodded and said, "These clients in trouble."
"Look, Fritz," I told him, "you’re a chef, not a diplomat, so why do you keep that up? You know we’ve had no client for a month and you want to know if we’ve hooked one, so why don’t you just ask? Repeat after me, ‘Have we got a client?’

 Try it."
"Archie." He turned a palm up. "You would have to say yes or no. The way I do it, you can biaiser if you wish."

 Try it."
"Archie." He turned a palm up. "You would have to say yes or no. The way I do it, you can biaiser if you wish."
I had to ask him how to spell it so I could look it up when I went to the office. Sitting, I picked up the Times, and my brow went up when I saw that it had made the front page. Probably on account of Martin Kirk; the Times loves architects as much as it hates disk jockeys and private detectives. It had nothing useful to add to what I had got from Lon, but it mentioned that Mrs. Kirk had been born in Manhattan, Kansas. Any other paper which had dug up that detail would have had a feature piece about born in Manhattan and died in Manhattan.
==> After three griddle cakes with homemade sausage and one with thyme honey, and two cups of coffee, I made it to the office in time to have the desks dusted, fresh water in the vase, biaiser looked up, and the mail opened, when Wolfe came down from the plant rooms. I waited until the orchids were in the vase and he had sat and glanced through the mail to tell him that it now looked as if someone had sent me a hot piece of evidence in a homicide, and I intended to find out why, of course on my own time, and anyway he wouldn’t be needing me since apparently there was nobody that needed him. <==
His lips tightened. "Evidence? Merely a conjecture."
"No, sir. I took it to Ludlow and it’s human blood. So I gave it to Cramer. Of
course you’ve read the Times?" "Yes."
"The blood is the same type as Mrs. Kirk’s. If it was or is a floundering numskull, obviously I’d better see - "
The doorbell rang.

"The blood is the same type as Mrs. Kirk’s. If it was or is a floundering numskull, obviously I’d better see - "
The doorbell rang.
I got up and went, telling myself it was even money it was James Neville Vance, but it wasn’t. A glance at the one-way glass panel in the front door settled that. It was a panhandler who had run out of luck and started ringing doorbells - a tall, lanky one pretending he had to lean against the jamb to keep himself upright. Opening the door, I said politely, "It’s a hard life. Good morning."
==> He got me in focus with bleary eyes and said, "I would like to see Nero Wolfe. <==

 My name is Martin Kirk."
If you think I should have recognized him from the pictures Lon had shown me, I don’t agree. You should have seen him. I told him Mr. Wolfe saw people only by appointment, but I’d ask. "You’re the Martin Kirk who lives at Two-nineteen Horn Street?"
He said he was, and I invited him in, ushered him into the front room and to a seat, which he evidently needed, went to the office by way of the connecting door, closed the door, and crossed to Wolfe’s desk. "I’m on my own time now," I told him. "It’s Martin Kirk. He asked to see you, but of course you’re not interested. May I use the front room?"
He took a deep breath, in through his nose and out through his mouth, then glared at me for five seconds and growled, "Bring him in."

Unheard of. Absolutely contrary to nature - his nature. The Nero Wolfe I thought I knew would at least have wanted me to pump him first. With a genius you never know. As I returned to the front room and told Kirk to come, I decided that the idea must be to show me that I would be a sap to waste my time. He would make short work of Martin Kirk. So as Kirk flopped into the red leather chair near the end of Wolfe’s desk he snapped at him, "Well, sir? I have read the morning paper. Why do you come to me?"
Kirk pressed the heels of his palms against his eyes. He groaned. He lowered his hands and the bleary eyes blinked a dozen times. "You’ll have to make allowances," he said. "I just left the district attorney’s office. I was there all night and no sleep."

Wolfe made a face. That complicated it. The mere thought of a man going without food was disagreeable, and to have one there in his house was intolerable. He had to either get him out in a hurry or feed him. "Why should I

 make allowances?" he demanded.

"Did you kill your wife?"
"No. But they think I did, and they think they can prove it. I haven’t got a lawyer, and I don’t know any lawyer I want to go to. I came to you because I know about you - partly that, and partly because they asked me a lot of questions about you - about you and Archie Goodwin." He looked at me, blinking to manage the change of focus. "You’re Archie Goodwin, aren’t you?"

He looked at me, blinking to manage the change of focus. "You’re Archie Goodwin, aren’t you?"
==> I told him yes and he went back to Wolfe. "They asked if I knew you or Goodwin, if I had ever met you, and they seemed to think I had - no, they did think I had. It seemed to have some connection with something that was mailed to Goodwin, and something about a necktie, and something about a phone call he got yesterday. I’m sorry to be so vague, but I said you’d have to make allowances, I’m not myself. I haven’t been myself since - I found - " His jaw had started to work and he stopped to control it. "My wife," he said. "They kept at me that she wasn’t much of a wife, and all right, she wasn’t, but if a woman - I mean if a man - " <==
He stopped again to handle his jaw. In a moment he went on, "So I came to you partly because I thought you might know about a necktie and a phone call and something that was mailed to Goodwin. Do you?"
"Possibly." Wolfe was regarding him. "Mr. Kirk. You said you can pay me, but I don’t sell information; I sell only services."
"That’s what I want, your services."
"You want to hire me to investigate this affair?" "Yes. That’s why I’m here."
"And you can pay me without undue strain?" "Yes. I have - Yes. Do you want a check now?"

Kirk actually tried to smile, and it made me want to feed him myself. "I know about you," he said. "You’re hard. And you charge high fees. I can pay you, don’t worry about that. They think I killed my wife. They let me go, but they - "
"Did you kill your wife?"
"No. But they think I did, and they think they can prove it. I haven’t got a lawyer, and I don’t know any lawyer I want to go to.

==> I had to shut my eyes a second to keep from gawking. That wasn’t only unheard of, it was unbelievable. Taking on a job, which meant that he would have to work, without the usual dodging and stalling - that could be on account of the lag in receipts; but taking a murder suspect for a client offhand, no questions asked but the routine did you kill her and can you pay me, without the faintest notion whether he was guilty or not and how much the cops had on him - that simply wasn’t done, not by anybody, let alone Nero Wolfe. I had to clamp my teeth on my lip to sit and take it. As Kirk got out a checkfold and a pen Wolfe pushed a button on his desk, and in a moment Fritz came. <==
"A tray, please," Wolfe told him. "The madrilène is ready?" "Yes, sir."
"And the pudding?"
"Yes, sir."
"A bowl of each, cheese with water cress, and hot tea."

AN HOUR LATER, when the doorbell rang again, Kirk was still there and still the client, and I would still have had to toss a coin to decide where I stood on the question, did he or didn’t he?
==> Wolfe had of course refused to either talk or listen until the tray had come and gone. Kirk had said he couldn’t eat, but when Wolfe insisted he tried, and if a man can swallow anything he can swallow Fritz’s madrilène with beet juice, and after one spoonful of his lemon sherry pudding with brown sugar sauce there’s no argument. The cheese and water cress were still on the tray when I took it to the kitchen, but the bowls were empty. <==
When I returned Wolfe had started in. "... so I’ll reverse the process," he was saying. "I’ll tell you and then ask you. Are you sufficiently yourself to

 comprehend?"
"I’m better. I didn’t think I could eat. I’m glad you made me." He didn’t look any better.
Wolfe nodded. "The brain can be hoodwinked but not the stomach. First, then, your statement that you didn’t kill your wife is of course of no weight. I have assumed that you didn’t for reasons of my own, which I reserve. Do you know or suspect who did kill her?"

"Then attend. An item in yesterday’s mail to this house was an envelope addressed to Mr. Goodwin, typewritten. A paper inside had a typewritten note saying, ‘Archie Goodwin, keep this until you hear from me, JNV.’ The envelope and paper were the engraved stationery of James Neville Vance. Also in the envelope was a four-in-hand necktie, cream-colored with brown diagonal stripes, and it had a spot on it, a large brown stain."
Kirk was squinting, concentrating. "So that’s how it was. They never told me exactly..."
"They wouldn’t. Neither would I if I weren’t engaged in your interest. At a quarter past eleven yesterday morning Mr. Goodwin got a phone call, and a voice that squeaked, presumably for disguise, said it was James Neville Vance and asked him to burn what he had received in the mail. Mr. Goodwin, provoked, went to Two-nineteen Horn Street and was admitted by Vance, who identified the tie as one of his but denied that he had sent it. As Mr. Goodwin was about to go a policeman arrived who wanted access to your apartment, and he was with Mr. Vance and the policeman when your wife’s body was discovered, but he left immediately. Later he took - "

"About two months ago."
"Where is it now?"
"I suppose - I don’t know."
"When you moved to a hotel room two weeks ago you took personal effects. Including that tie?"
"I don’t know. I didn’t notice. I took all my clothes, but I wasn’t noticing things like ties. I’ll see if it’s there."
==> "It isn’t." Wolfe took a deep breath, leaned back, and closed his eyes. Kirk looked at me, blinking, and was going to say something, but I shook my head. He had said enough already to make me think it might have been better all around if I had burned the damned souvenirs and crossed it off. He put his palms to his temples and massaged. <==
Wolfe opened his eyes and straightened up. He regarded Kirk, not cordially. "It’s a mess," he stated. "I have questions of course, but you’ll answer them more to the point if I first expound this necktie tangle. Are your wits up to it? Should you sleep first?"
"No. If I don’t - I’m all right."
"Pfui. You can’t even focus your eyes properly. I’ll merely describe it and ignore the intricacies. Assuming that the blood on the tie is in fact your wife’s blood, there are three obvious theories. The police theory must be that when you killed your wife the blood got on the tie, either inadvertently or by your deliberate act,

 and to implicate Vance you used his stationery to mail it to Mr. Goodwin. It was probably premeditated, since you had the stationery at hand. I don’t ask if that was possible; the police must know it was. You had been in his apartment, hadn’t you?"

"They were already public property - our little public." He swallowed. "I knew when I married her that she was promis - no, she wasn’t promiscuous, she was too sensitive for that. She was incredibly beautiful. You know that?"
"No."
"She was. I thought then that she was simply curious about men, and impetuous - and a little reckless. I didn’t know until after we had been married a few months that she had no moral sense about sexual relations - not just no moral sense, no sense. She was sensitive, very sensitive, but that’s different. But I was stuck. I don’t mean I was stuck just because I was married to her, that’s simple enough nowadays, I mean I was really stuck. Do you know what it’s like to have all your feelings and desires, all the desires that really matter, to have them all centered on a woman, one woman?"
"No."
"I do." He shook his head, jerked it from side to side several times. "What got me started?"
==> He could have meant either what got him started on that woman or what got him started talking about her. Wolfe, assuming the latter, said, "I asked you about Mr. Vance. Was he one of the objects of her curiosity?" <==
"Good Lord, no."
"You can’t be sure of that."
"Oh yes I can. She never bothered to pretend. I tell you, she had no sense. I did some work for Vance on a couple of buildings, and I had that apartment before I

as married. For her he was a nice old guy, rather a bore, who let her use one of his pianos when she felt like it. I am sure."

It would be fatuous not to assume, tentatively at least, that whoever killed your wife sent the necktie to Mr. Goodwin, either to involve Mr. Vance or with some design more artful. So he had access to Vance’s stationery and either to his tie rack or to yours; and he had had enough association with your wife to want her dead.

He stopped abruptly. Wolfe eyed him. "His name?" "No. He didn’t want her dead."

==> "We’ll return to him later." Wolfe glanced up at the clock and shifted his bulk in the chair. "Now you. Not to try you; to learn the extent of your peril. I want the answers you have given the police. I don’t ask where you were Monday afternoon because if you were excluded by an alibi you wouldn’t be here. Why did you move to a hotel room two weeks ago? What you have told the police." <==
"I told them the truth. I had to decide what to do. Seeing my wife and hearing her, having her touch me - it had become impossible."
"Did you decide what to do?"
"Yes. I decided to try to persuade her to have a baby. I thought that might make her ... might change her. I realized I couldn’t be sure the baby was mine, but there was no way out of that. That’s what I told the police, but it wasn’t true. The baby idea was only one of many that I thought of, and I knew it was no good, I knew I couldn’t take it, not knowing if I was its father. I didn’t actually decide anything."
"But you dialed her phone number six times between four o’clock Monday afternoon and ten o’clock Tuesday morning. What for?"
"What I told the police? To say I wanted to see her, to persuade her to have a baby."

You could pity me or you could sneer at me, but I wouldn’t give a damn, it wouldn’t mean a thing. Say I was obsessed, and what does that mean? I still had my faculties, I could do my work pretty well, and I could even think straight about her, as far as thinking went. One of the ideas I had, I realized that the one thing I could do that would settle it was to kill her. I knew I couldn’t do it, but I realized that that was the one sure thing, and I wished I could do it." <==
He opened the fists and closed them again. "I hadn’t seen her or heard her voice for two weeks, and I dialed the number, and when there was still no answer the sixth time I went there. When there was no answer to my ring from the vestibule and I went in and took the elevator I intended to use my key upstairs too, but I didn’t. I simply couldn’t. She might be there and - and not alone. I left and went

 to a bar and bought a drink but didn’t drink it. I wanted to know if her things were there, and I thought of phoning Jimmy Vance, but finally decided to phone police headquarters instead. Even if they found her there and someone with her, that might - "
The doorbell rang, and I went, again giving myself even money that it was Vance, and losing again. It was a girl, or woman, and she had a kind of eyes that I had met only twice before, once a woman and once a man. I have a habit, when it’s a stranger on the stoop, of taking a five-second look through the one-way glass and tagging him or her, to see how close I can come. From inside, the view through the glass is practically clear, but from the outside it might as well be wood. But she could see through. Of course she couldn’t, but she was face-to- face with me, and her eyes, slanted up, had exactly the look they would have if she were seeing me. They were nice enough hazel eyes, but I hadn’t liked it the other two times it had happened, and I didn’t like it then. Not trying to tag her, I opened the door.
"I beg your pardon," she said. "I believe Mr. Kirk is here? Martin Kirk?"

It wasn’t possible. They wouldn’t put a female dick on his tail, and even if they did she wouldn’t be it, with that attractive little face and soft little voice. But there she was. "I beg your pardon," I said, "but what makes you think so?"

"That’s an odd name. Nero Wolfe? What does he - Is he a lawyer?"
Either she meant it or she was extremely good. If the former, it would be a pleasure to tell Wolfe and see him grunt. "No," I said. Let her work for it.

"I beg your pardon," she said. "I believe Mr. Kirk is here? Martin Kirk?"
It wasn’t possible. They wouldn’t put a female dick on his tail, and even if they did she wouldn’t be it, with that attractive little face and soft little voice. But there she was. "I beg your pardon," I said, "but what makes you think so?"
"He must be. I saw him come in and I haven’t seen him come out." "Then he’s here. And?"
"Would you mind telling me whose house - who lives here?" "Nero Wolfe. It’s his house and he lives here."
"That’s an odd name. Nero Wolfe? What does he - Is he a lawyer?"
==> Either she meant it or she was extremely good. If the former, it would be a pleasure to tell Wolfe and see him grunt. "No," I said. Let her work for it. <==
"Is Mr. Kirk all right?"
"We haven’t been introduced," I said. "My name is Archie Goodwin and I live here. Your turn."


Her mouth opened and closed again. She considered it, her eyes meeting mine exactly as they had when she couldn’t see me. "I’m Rita Fougere," she said. "Mrs. Paul Fougere. Will you tell Mr. Kirk I’m here and would like to see him?"

==> It was my turn to consider. The rule didn’t apply - the rule that I am to take no one in to Wolfe without consulting him; she wanted to see Kirk, not Wolfe. And I was riled. The tie had been mailed to me, not him, but he hadn’t even glanced at me before taking Kirk on and feeding him. I was by no means satisfied that Kirk was straight, and I wanted to see how he took it when Paul Fougere’s wife suddenly appeared. <==
"You might as well tell him yourself," I said. "Also you might as well know that Nero Wolfe is a private detective, and so am I. Come in."
I made room for her and she entered, and after shutting the door I preceded her down the hall and into the office. As I approached Wolfe’s desk I said, "Someone to see Mr. Kirk," and I was right there when he twisted around and saw her, said "Rita!" and left the chair. She offered both hands, and he took them. "Martin, Martin," she said, low, with those eyes at him.
"But how ..." He let her hands go. "How did you know I was here?" "I followed you."
"Followed me?"
She nodded. "From down there. I was there too, and when I left and had got into a taxi you came out. I called to you but you didn’t hear me, and when you got another taxi I told my driver to follow. I saw you come in here, and I waited outside, and when you didn’t come out, a whole hour - "

"But what - You shouldn’t, Rita. You can’t - There’s nothing you can do. Were you there all night too?"
"No, just this morning. I was afraid - your face, the way you looked. I was terribly afraid. I know I can’t - or maybe I can. If you’ll come - Have you eaten anything?"

She started a hand to touch him but let it drop. "I’ll wait for you," she said. "I’ll be outside."
"If you please." It was Wolfe. His eyes were at the client. "You have a chore, Mr. Kirk. I need to know if that article is among your belongings in your room, and you will please go and find out and phone me. Meanwhile I’ll talk with Mrs. Fougere. If you will, madam? I’m working for Mr. Kirk."

"Nonsense," Wolfe snapped. "She has been questioned by the police. And she’s your friend?"

He said he would and headed for the hall, and I went to see him out. When I returned Mrs. Fougere was in the red leather chair, which would have held two of her, and Wolfe, leaning back, was regarding her without enthusiasm. He would rather tackle almost any man than any woman on earth.

"That will do. What did you say when the police asked if you were in the habit of lunching with Mr. Kirk?"
"It wasn’t a habit. He had left his wife and he - he needed friends." "You’re strongly attached to him?"
"Yes."
"Is he attached to you?"
"No."
==> Wolfe grunted. "If this were a hostile examination your answers would be admirable, but for me they’re a little curt. Do you know how your husband spent Monday afternoon?" <==
"I know how he says he did. He went to Long Island City to look at some equipment and got back too late to go to the office. He went to a bar and had drinks and came home a little before seven, and we went out to a restaurant for dinner." She made a little gesture. "Mr. Wolfe, I don’t want to be curt. If I thought I knew anything that would help Martin, anything at all, I’d tell you."
"Then we’ll see what you know. What if I establish that your husband killed Mrs. Kirk?"

She took a moment. "Do you mean if you proved it? If you got him arrested for it?"
Wolfe nodded. "That would probably be necessary to clear Mr. Kirk."

"Yes."
"They knew you were?"
"Yes."

"They knew you were?"
"Yes."
"You were complacent about it?"
"No." It came out a whisper, and she repeated it. "No." Her mouth began working, and she clamped her jaw to stop it. "Of course," she said, "you think I might have killed her. If I had, it would have been on account of Martin, not my husband. She was ruining Martin’s life, making it impossible for him. But she couldn’t ruin my husband’s life because he’s too - well, too shallow."
She stopped, breathed, and went on, "I wouldn’t have dreamed that I would ever be saying things like this, to anyone, but I said some of them even to the police. Now I would say anything if it would help Martin. I wasn’t complacent about Paul and Bonny; it just didn’t matter, because nothing mattered but Martin. I was an ignorant little fool when I married Paul, I thought I might as well because I had never been in love and I thought I never would be. When they began asking me questions yesterday I decided I wouldn’t try to hide how I feel about Martin, and anyway, I don’t think I could, now. I did before."
==> Wolfe looked at the clock. Twenty to one. Thirty-five minutes till lunch. "You say she couldn’t have ruined your husband’s life because he’s too shallow. Do you utterly reject the possibility that he killed her?" <==
She took a breath. "I don’t - That’s too strong. If he was there with her and she

 said something or did something... I don’t know."
"Do you know if he had in his possession some of the personal stationery of James Neville Vance? A letterhead, an envelope?"
Her eyes widened. "What? Jimmy Vance?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74212    window = 74207 74217


Mr. Kirk?"
"No, never. He drinks scotch."
"Does Mr. Vance?"
"Yes. He got my husband started on it. The police asked me all this." "Naturally. Do you drink vodka?"
"No. I drink sherry." She shook her head. "I don’t understand - maybe you’ll tell me. All the questions the police asked me - they seem to be sure it was one of us, Martin or Paul or Jimmy Vance or me. Now you too. But it could have been some other man that Bonny ... or someone, a burglar or something - couldn’t it?"
==> "Not impossible," Wolfe conceded, "but more than doubtful. Because of the circumstance that prompted my question about Mr. Vance’s stationery, and now this question: What kind of a housekeeper are you? Do you concern yourself with the condition of your husband’s clothing?" <==
She nearly smiled. "You ask the strangest questions. Yes, I do. Even though we’re not - Yes, I sew on buttons."
"Then you know what he has, or had. Have you ever seen among his things a cream-colored necktie with diagonal brown stripes, narrow stripes?"
She frowned. "That’s Jimmy Vance again, those are his colors. He has a tie like that, more than one probably."
"He had nine. Again a simple question. Have you ever seen one of them in your husband’s possession? Not necessarily in his hands or on his person; say in one of his drawers?"
"No. Mr. Wolfe, this circumstance - what is it? You say Martin knows about it, but I’m answering your questions, and I - "

"Of course you made sure."

Yes. Positive."
"Hold the wire." I turned. "Kirk. The article isn’t there." He nodded. "As expected."

"Martin?"
"Yes. Rita?"
"Yes. Where are you?"
"In my room at the hotel. You’re still there?"
"Yes. What are you going to do? Are you going to your office?"

I cut in. "Hold it. I’ve told Mr. Wolfe and he’ll have instructions. Hold the wire." I turned. "He says he’s going to see Vance. Shall I tell him to lay off or will you?"
"Neither. He’s had no sleep and not much to eat. Tell him to come this evening, say nine o’clock, if he’s awake, and report on his talk with Mr. Vance."
"You tell him," I said and hung up. Being a salaried employee, I should of course keep my place in the presence of company, and that’s exactly what I was doing, keeping my place. I had had enough and then some, and Wolfe’s glare, which of course came automatically, was wasted because my head was turned and he had my profile, including the set of my jaw. When Rita was through with the phone he took it, spoke briefly with his client, cradled it, and looked at the clock. Six minutes to lunch.

Do you want me any more?" she asked him. "I’d like to go." "Later perhaps," he said. "If you’ll phone a little after six?"

"Good Lord no. I’m going to see Jimmy Vance. Then I’m going to see Nero Wolfe again. Someone has - "
==> I cut in. "Hold it. I’ve told Mr. Wolfe and he’ll have instructions. Hold the wire." I turned. "He says he’s going to see Vance. Shall I tell him to lay off or will you?" <==
"Neither. He’s had no sleep and not much to eat. Tell him to come this evening, say nine o’clock, if he’s awake, and report on his talk with Mr. Vance."
"You tell him," I said and hung up. Being a salaried employee, I should of course keep my place in the presence of company, and that’s exactly what I was doing, keeping my place. I had had enough and then some, and Wolfe’s glare, which of course came automatically, was wasted because my head was turned and he had my profile, including the set of my jaw. When Rita was through with the phone he took it, spoke briefly with his client, cradled it, and looked at the clock. Six minutes to lunch.

Do you want me any more?" she asked him. "I’d like to go." "Later perhaps," he said. "If you’ll phone a little after six?"
I got up and spoke. "If you don’t mind, Mrs. Fougere." I crossed to the door to the front room and opened it. "If you’ll wait in here just a few minutes?"

She looked at Wolfe, saw that he had no comment, and came. When she had crossed the sill I closed the door, which is as soundproof as the wall, went to Wolfe’s desk, and said, "If it blows up in your face you’re not going to blame it on me. I merely called your attention a couple of times to the fact that a fee would be welcome. I didn’t say it was desperate, that you should grab a measly grand from a character who is probably going to be tagged for the big one. And now when he says he is going to see Vance, to handle the tie question on his own - and the tie was sent to me, not you - you not only don’t veto it, you don’t even tell me to go and sit in. Also she’s going there too, that’s obvious, and you merely tell her to phone you later. I admit you’re a genius, but when you took his check you couldn’t possibly have had the faintest idea whether he was guilty or not, and even now you don’t know the score. They may have him absolutely wrapped up. The tie was mailed to me and I gave it to Cramer, and I’m asking, not respectfully."
He nodded. "Well said. A good speech." "Thank you. And?"

"I didn’t tell you to go because it’s lunchtime. Also I doubt if you would get anything useful. Naturally I’ll have to see Mr. Vance - and Mr. Fougere. As for desperation, when I took Mr. Kirk’s check I knew it was extremely improbable that he had killed his wife, and I - "
"How?"
He shook his head. "You call me to account? You know everything that I know; ponder it yourself. If instead of lunch you choose to be present at a futile conversation, do so by all means. I will not be hectored into an explanation you shouldn’t need."
Fritz entered to announce lunch, saw what the atmosphere was, and stood. I went and opened the door to the front room, passed through, and told Rita, "All right, Mrs. Fougere. I’m going along."

WHEN YOU’RE GOOD and sore at someone it’s simple. You cuss him out, to his face if he’s available and privately if he isn’t, and you take steps if and as you can. When you’re sore at yourself it’s even simpler; the subject is right there and can’t skip. But when you’re sore at yourself and someone else at the same time you’re in a fix. If you try to concentrate on one the other one horns in and gets you off balance, and that was the state I was in as I stood aside in the vestibule of Two-nineteen Horn Street while Rita Fougere used her key on the door. In the taxi on the way down I had told her about the necktie problem. She might as well get it from me as later from Kirk, and she might as well understand why Kirk wanted to see Vance.
I supposed she would want to go first to her own apartment on the ground floor; surely any woman would whose face needed attention as much as hers - but no. Straight to the elevator and up, and out at the third floor, and she pressed the button at Vance’s door. It opened, and Vance was there. His face wasn’t as neat and smooth as it had been the day before, and he had on a different outfit - a conservative gray suit, a white shirt, and a plain gray tie. Of course the DA’s office had had him down too. He said "Rita!" and put out a hand, then saw me, but I can’t say what kind of a welcome I would have got because Kirk interrupted, stepping over and telling Rita she shouldn’t have come. She said something, but he wasn’t listening because he had noticed me.
==> "I’m glad you’re here," he said. "It’s not very clear in my mind, what Nero Wolfe told me about the tie. I was just going to tell Vance about him. Rita, please! You can’t - this is my trouble." <==
"Listen, Martin," she said, "you shouldn’t be here. I know now why they think it was one of us, so it’s our trouble. You should leave it to him - Nero Wolfe. You shouldn’t be talking about it with anybody, not even me. Isn’t that right, Mr. Goodwin?"
"Mr. Wolfe knew he was coming," I said. I have mentioned that I was sore. "Mr. Wolfe has been called a wizard by various people, and with a wizard you never know. Of course he had me come." I had to force my tongue to let that through, but a private scrap should be kept private.
Vance was frowning at me. "Nero Wolfe had you come? Here?"

A bell tinkled. I was between Vance and the door, and I moved to let him by. He opened the door and a man stepped in, darted a glance around, and squeaked, "What, a party? A hell of a time for a party, Jimmy."

I say he squeaked because he did, but it was obviously his natural squeak, not the kind on the phone that had told me to burn the tie, though it didn’t fit his six feet and broad shoulders and handsome, manly face. "It’s no party, Paul," Vance told him, but Paul ignored him and was at Rita. "My pet, you’re a perfect fright. You look godawful." He wheeled to Kirk. "And look at you, Martin my boy. Only why not? Why are you still loose?" He looked at me. "Are you a cop?"

"Can it," Paul cut in. "You’ve got a nerve to ask anybody anything. Why are you loose? Okay, you killed her, she’s dead. What kind of a dodge are you trying

 with one of Jimmy’s neckties with a spot on it?"
"No," Kirk said. "I didn’t kill her."
"Oh, can it. I was thinking maybe you do have some guts after all. She decorated you with one of the finest pairs of horns on record, and you never moved a finger. You just took it lying down - or I should say standing up. I thought it would be hard to find a poorer excuse for a man, but yesterday when I heard what had happened - "
==> Of course I had heard and read of a man slapping another man, but that was the first time I had ever actually seen it - a smack with an open palm on the side of the head. Kirk said nothing, he merely slapped him, and Paul Fougere said nothing either, he merely started a fist for Kirk’s jaw. I didn’t move. Since Fougere was four inches broader and twenty pounds heavier, I fully expected to see Kirk go down, and in any situation I am supposed to take any necessary steps to protect the interests of a client, but if Wolfe wanted that client protected he could come and do it himself. <==
But I got a surprise and so did Fougere. He landed once, a glancing blow on the shoulder as Kirk twisted and jerked his head back, but that was all. Not that Kirk had any technique. I would guess that the point was that at last he was doing something he had really wanted to do for a long time, and while spirit isn’t all, it’s a lot. He clipped Fougere at least twenty times, just anywhere - face, neck, chest, ribs - never with enough steam to floor him or even stagger him. But one of the wild pokes got the nose fair and square, and the blood started. It was up to me because Vance was busy keeping Rita off, and when the blood had Fougere’s mouth and chin pretty well covered I got Kirk from behind and yanked him back and then stepped in between.
"You’re going to drip," I told Fougere. "I suppose you know where the bathroom is."
He was panting. He put his hand to his mouth, took it away, saw the blood, and turned and headed for the rear. I pivoted. Kirk, also panting, was on a chair, head down, inspecting his knuckles. They probably had no skin left. Vance was staring at him, apparently as surprised as Fougere had been. Rita was positively glowing. With color in her face she was more than attractive. "Should I go?" she asked me. "Does he need help?"
That’s true love. Martin the Great had hit him, so he must be in a bad way. It

That’s true love. Martin the Great had hit him, so he must be in a bad way. It

 would have been a shame to tell her it had been just pecks. I said no, he’d probably make it, and went to help Kirk examine his knuckles. They weren’t so bad.
"Why didn’t you stop them?" Vance demanded.
"I thought I did," I said. "With a mauler like Kirk you have to time it."
==> "I wouldn’t have thought..." He let it go. "Did you say he went to Nero Wolfe?" <==
"No, he did. But I can confirm it, I was present. He has hired Nero Wolfe. That’s why I’m here. I am collecting information that will establish the innocence of Mr. Wolfe’s client. Have you got any?"
"I’m afraid I haven’t." He was frowning. "But of course he is innocent. What Paul Fougere said, that’s ridiculous. I hope he didn’t tell the police that. But with their experience, I don’t suppose - "
The bell tinkled. Vance went to the door and opened it, and in came the law. Anyone with half an eye would know it was the law even if they had never seen or heard of Sergeant Purley Stebbins. Two steps in he stopped for a look and saw me.
"Yeah," he said, "I thought so. You and Wolfe are going to be good and sick of this one. I hope you try to hang on." His eyes went right. Fougere had appeared at the rear of the room. "Everybody, huh? I’m sorry to interrupt, Mr. Vance."
He moved. "You’re wanted downtown for more questions, Mr. Kirk. I’ll take you."

"We’ve got some new ones. I might as well ask one of them now. Did you buy a typewriter at the Midtown Office Equipment Company on July nineteenth and trade in your old one?"
"Yes. I don’t know - July nineteenth - about then, yes."
"Okay. We want you to identify the one you traded in. Come along."

"Okay. We want you to identify the one you traded in. Come along."

 "Are you arresting me?"
"If you prefer it that way I can. Material witness. Or if you balk I’ll phone for a warrant and keep you company till it comes, maybe an hour. With Goodwin here I’ve got to toe the line. He’s hell on wheels, Goodwin is."
Kirk made it to his feet. "All right," he mumbled. He had been without sleep for thirty hours and maybe more. Rita Fougere aimed those eyes at me.
==> I bowed out. Being hell on wheels is fine and dandy if you have anywhere to steer for, but I hadn’t. I went and opened the door and on out, took the elevator down, exchanged no greeting with the driver of the police car out front, though we had met, walked till I found a taxi, and told the hackie 618 West 35th Street; and when he said that was Nero Wolfe’s house I actually said such is fame. That’s the shape I was in. <==
Wolfe was at table in the dining room, putting a gob of his favorite cheese on a wafer. When I entered he looked up and said politely, "Fritz is keeping the kidneys warm."
I stopped three steps in. "Many thanks," I said even more politely. "You were right as usual; the conversation was futile. They had a tail on Kirk, here and to the hotel and on to Horn Street. When Purley Stebbins arrived at Vance’s apartment he knew Kirk was there and he wasn’t surprised to see me. He had come for your client and took him. They have found the typewriter that addressed that envelope to me and the message. It belonged to Kirk, but on July nineteenth he traded it in on another one. Since you don’t talk business at meals, I’ll eat in the kitchen."
I wheeled, hell on wheels, and went to the kitchen.

NEARLY FOUR HOURS LATER, at six o’clock, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Fougere were in the office, waiting for Wolfe to come down from the plant rooms - she in the red leather chair and he in one of the yellow ones in front of Wolfe’s desk. To my surprise he had two marks, a red slightly puffed nose and a little bruise under his left eye. I hadn’t thought Kirk had shown that much power, but of course with bare knuckles it doesn’t take much.

When Purley Stebbins arrived at Vance’s apartment he knew Kirk was there and he wasn’t surprised to see me. He had come for your client and took him. They have found the typewriter that addressed that envelope to me and the message. It belonged to Kirk, but on July nineteenth he traded it in on another one. Since you don’t talk business at meals, I’ll eat in the kitchen."
I wheeled, hell on wheels, and went to the kitchen.

NEARLY FOUR HOURS LATER, at six o’clock, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Fougere were in the office, waiting for Wolfe to come down from the plant rooms - she in the red leather chair and he in one of the yellow ones in front of Wolfe’s desk. To my surprise he had two marks, a red slightly puffed nose and a little bruise under his left eye. I hadn’t thought Kirk had shown that much power, but of course with bare knuckles it doesn’t take much.

I bowed out. Being hell on wheels is fine and dandy if you have anywhere to steer for, but I hadn’t. I went and opened the door and on out, took the elevator down, exchanged no greeting with the driver of the police car out front, though we had met, walked till I found a taxi, and told the hackie 618 West 35th Street; and when he said that was Nero Wolfe’s house I actually said such is fame. That’s the shape I was in.

Nothing had happened to change my attitude or opinion. When I went to the office after finishing with the kept-warm kidneys and accessories Wolfe permitted me to report on the conversation and slugging match at Vance’s apartment, leaning back and closing his eyes to show he was listening, but he didn’t even grunt when I told the Stebbins part, though ordinarily it gets under his skin, way under, when a client is hauled in. When I was through I said it was a good thing he knew Kirk was innocent since otherwise the typewriter development might make him wonder.
His eyes opened. "I didn’t say I knew it. I said it was extremely improbable that he had killed his wife, and it still is. Any of the others could have managed access to his typewriter for a few minutes, in his absence."
"Sure. And when his wife told him she had let someone use it, it made him so mad he got rid of it the next day. She could confirm it, but she’s dead. Tough. Or his getting rid of it just then could have been coincidence, but that would be even tougher. Judges and juries hate coincidence, and I’ve heard you make remarks about it."

"Only when it’s in my way, not when it serves me." He straightened up and reached for his book. "Can Mrs. Fougere have her husband here at six o’clock?"
"I haven’t asked her. I doubt it. They’re not chummy, and he’s the wrong end of the horse."
"Perhaps ..." He considered it. He shook his head. "No. I must see him. Tell her to tell him, or you tell him, that he has slandered my client before witnesses, and he will either sign a retraction and apology or defend a suit for defamation of character. I’ll expect him at six o’clock." He picked up the book and opened it.

Cut. I hadn’t expected him to open up, since he is as pigheaded as I am steadfast, but he could have made some little comment. As I looked up the Fougere number and dialed it, I was actually considering something I had never done and thought I never would: retract, apologize, and ask him please to tell me, as a favor to an old associate and loyal assistant, what the hell was in his mind, if anything. But of course I didn’t. When I hung up after getting no answer from the Fougere number, I had an idea: I would ask him if he wanted me to phone Parker. With a client collared as a material witness and probably headed for the coop on a murder charge, it should be not only routine but automatic for him to

 get Parker. But I looked at his face as he sat, comfortable, his eyes on the book, and vetoed it. He would merely say no and go on reading. It would have improved my feelings to pick up something and throw it at him, but not the situation, so I arose, went to the hall and up two flights to my room, stood at the window, and reviewed the past thirty hours, trying to spot the catch I had missed, granting there had been one. The trouble was I was sore. You can work when you’re sore, or eat or sleep or fight, but you can’t think straight.
==> My next sight of Wolfe was at two minutes past six when the elevator brought him down from the plant rooms and he entered the office. The slander approach had got results. The fifth time I tried the Fougere number, a little after four, Paul had answered, and I poured it on. On the phone his squeak sounded more like the one that had told me to burn the tie, but of course it would. A voice on a phone, unless it’s one you know well, is tricky. He said he’d come. An hour later Rita phoned. She was too frantic to be practical. She wanted to know if we had heard from Kirk, and were we doing anything and if so what, and shouldn’t Kirk have a lawyer. Being sore, I told her Wolfe was responsible to his client, not to her, that Kirk would of course need a lawyer, if and when he was charged with something, and that we were expecting her husband at six o’clock. When she said she knew that and she was coming along, I said she might as well have saved the dime. I am rude to people only when I am being rude to myself, or they have asked for it. I admit she hadn’t asked for it. <==
For Wolfe, being rude is no problem at all. When he entered he detoured around the red leather chair to his desk, gave Rita a nod, sat, narrowed his eyes at the husband, and snapped, "You’re Paul Fougere?"
It’s hard to snap back with a squeak, but Fougere did the best he could with what he had. "You’re Nero Wolfe?"
"I am. Did you kill that woman?"
I had known when I let them in that Fougere had decided on his line. It’s easy to see when a man’s all set. So the unexpected question flustered him. "You know damn well I didn’t," he said. "You know who did, or you ought to."
"Possibly I don’t. Do you?"

"You were the only other one that heard me. I’m telling you now, I can’t prove it and I shouldn’t have said it." Back to Wolfe: "That covers it. Now try hooking me for defamation of character."
"Pfui." Wolfe flipped a hand to dismiss it. "I never intended to. That was only to get you here. I wanted to tell you something and ask you something. First, you’re a blatherskite. You may perhaps know that Mr. Kirk didn’t kill his wife, but you can’t possibly know that he did. Manifestly you’re either a jackass or a murderer, and conceivably both." He turned his head. "Archie. A twenty-dollar bill, please."
I went to the safe and got a twenty from the petty cash drawer and came back and offered it, but he shook his head. "Give it to Mrs. Fougere." To Paul: "I assume your wife is an acceptable stakeholder. Give her a dollar. Twenty to one Mr. Kirk did not kill his wife."
"You’ve got a bet." Fougere got out his wallet, extracted a bill, and handed it to me. "You keep it, Goodwin. My wife might spend it. I suppose his conviction decides it? Do I have to wait until after the appeals and all the horsing around?"

"Then you know why attention is centered on you four, both the police’s attention and mine. You all had opportunity; any of you could have been admitted to that apartment Monday afternoon by Mrs. Kirk, and Mr. Kirk had a key. The means, the vodka bottle, was at hand. What about motive? Let’s consider that. That’s what I want to discuss with you. You are well acquainted with those three people and their relationships, both with one another and with Mrs. Kirk. Your adroit handling of my charge of slander showed that you have a facile and ingenious mind. I invite you to exercise it. Start with yourself. If you killed Mrs. Kirk, what was your motive?"
Fougere pronounced a word that isn’t supposed to be used with a lady present, and since some lady may read this I’ll skip it. He added, "I didn’t."

"I know. I’ll rephrase it. If you had killed Mrs. Kirk, what would have been your motive? You’re staying to hear my questions because you’re curious. I’m curious too. What would have been your motive? Is it inconceivable that you could have had one? You need not be reserved because your wife is here; she has informed me of your intimacy with Mrs. Kirk. When I suggested to her the possibility that you had killed her, she said no, you were too shallow. Are you?"
==> Fougere looked at Rita. "That’s a new one, my pet. Shallow. You should have told me." To Wolfe: "Certainly I could have had a motive for killing her. I could name four men that could - counting Kirk, five." <==
"What would yours have been?"
"That would depend on when. Two months ago it would have been for my - well, for my health."
"And Monday? I’m not just prattling. Monday?"
"It’s prattle to me. Monday, that would have been different. It would still have been for my health, but in a different way. Very different. Do you want me to spell it out?"
"I think not. So much for you. If your wife killed her, what was her motive?"

"I think not. So much for you. If your wife killed her, what was her motive?"
"Now that’s a thought." He grinned. "That appeals to me. We hadn’t touched each other for nearly a year and she wanted me back. I’m shallow, but I’ve got

 charm. I’m not using it right now, but I’ve got it, don’t think I haven’t."
I was looking at Rita because I had had enough of looking at him, and from the expression on her face I would have given twenty to one that she was thinking what I was: that he was one in a million. He actually had no idea of how she felt about Kirk. Not that he would necessarily have brought it in, but his tone, even more than his words, made it obvious. I took another look at him. A man that dumb could batter a woman’s skull with a vodka bottle and mosey to the nearest bar and order a vodka and tonic.
==> Wolfe had the thought too, for he asked, "Have you no other motive to suggest for your wife?" <==
"No. Isn’t that enough? A jealous wife?"
"There are precedents. I assume Mr. Kirk presents no difficulty. Since you think you know he killed her, you must know why."
"So do you."
"Correct. Since like the others it’s an if. He could no longer abide her infidelities, he couldn’t break loose because he was infatuated, and he couldn’t change her, so he took the only way out, since he wanted to live. You agree?"
"Sure. That has precedents too."

"But he was still hoping."
"Oh sure, for her that was easy. If you had known Bonny - Hell, she could have
played you and kept you hoping. Bonny could play any man alive."
"Have you told the police this?"
"You mean about Vance? No. Why would I? I don’t know why I’m telling you."
==> "I invited it. I worked for it." Wolfe leaned back and took a deep breath, then another one. "I am obliged to you, sir, and I don’t like to be in debt. I’ll save you a dollar. We’ll call the bet off." <==
"We will not," Fougere squeaked. "You want to welsh?"
"No. I want to show my appreciation. Very well; it can be returned to you." Wolfe swiveled. "Madam, it’s fortunate that you came with your husband. There will be three of us to refresh his memory on what he has told me if at some future time he is inclined to forget. I suggest that you should write it down and..."
I was listening with only one ear. Now that I knew which target he was aiming at, I should certainly be able to spot what had made him pick it, and I shut my eyes to concentrate. If you had already spotted it, as you probably had, and are thinking I’m thick, you will please consider that all four points went back to before the body was discovered. I got one point in half a minute, but that wasn’t enough, and by the time I opened my eyes Fougere had gone and Rita was on her feet, prattling. Wolfe looked at me. I am expected - by him - both to understand women and to know how to handle them, which is ridiculous. I’ll skip how I handled her and got her out because I was rude again, making twice in less than two hours.
When I returned to the office after shutting the door behind her I had things to say, but Wolfe was leaning back with his eyes closed, and his lips were working, so I went to my desk and sat. When we’re alone I’ll interrupt him no matter what he’s doing, with only one exception, the lip exercise. When he’s pushing his lips

He opened his eyes, sat up, and growled, "We’re going to need Mrs. Fougere." I stood up. "I might possibly catch her. Is it urgent?"

"Certainly not. We have a job before we’re ready for Mr. Cramer, and not an easy one. Phenomena needed for proof may not exist, and even if they do they may be undiscoverable. Our only recourse - "
The doorbell rang. I got up and went to the hall, took a look, stepped back into the office, and said, "Nuts. Cramer."
"No," he snapped.
"Do you want to count ten?" "No."

==> I admit it’s a pleasure to slip the bolt in, open the door the two inches the chain permits, and through the crack tell a police inspector that Mr. Wolfe is engaged and can’t be disturbed. The simple pleasures of a private detective. But that time I didn’t have it. I was still a step short of the door when a bellow came from the office, my name, and I turned and went back. <==
"Bring him," Wolfe commanded.
The doorbell rang. "Maybe this time you should count ten," I suggested. "No. Bring him."
I went. From my long acquaintance with Cramer’s face I can tell with one glance through the glass if he’s on the warpath, so I knew he wasn’t before I opened the door. He even greeted me as if it didn’t hurt. Of course he didn’t let me take his hat, that would have been going too far, but he removed it on his way down the hall. When he’s boiling he leaves it on. From the way he greeted Wolfe it seemed likely that he would have offered a hand to shake if he hadn’t known that Wolfe never did.
"Another hot day," he said and sat in the red leather chair, not settling back, and hanging on to his hat. "I just stopped in on my way home. You’re never on your way home, because you’re always home."
I stared at him. Unbelievable. He was chatting!

==> Wolfe nodded. "I’m prepared to. Not to give you facts, for you already have them; I’ll merely expound. You shouldn’t need it, but you have been centered on Mr. Kirk. Do you know all the details of the necktie episode? Mr. Goodwin getting it in the mail, the phone call he received, and his visit to Mr. Vance?" <==
"Yes."
"Then attend. Four points. First the phone call. It came at a quarter past eleven. You assume that Mr. Kirk made it, pretending he was Vance. That’s untenable, or at least implausible. How would he dare? For all he knew, Mr. Goodwin had phoned Vance or gone to see him immediately after opening the envelope. For him to phone and say he was Vance would have been asinine."
Cramer grunted. "He was off his hinges. The shape he was in, he wouldn’t see that."
"I concede the possibility. The second point. When Mr. Goodwin went to see Vance he showed him the envelope and letterhead and let him take the tie to examine it. Vance was completely mystified. You know what was said and done. He inspected the ties in his closet and said that the one that had been mailed to Mr. Goodwin was his. But when Mr. Goodwin asked for it he handed it over without hesitation. Preposterous."
Cramer shook his head. "I don’t think so. The body hadn’t been discovered. He thought it was just some screwy gag."

Nonsense."
"But he did. If he killed her, why isn’t it still nonsense?"

It was ill-conceived and ill-executed, and it was infantile, but it wasn’t nonsense. The third point, and the most significant: two missing neckties. He had nine and had given one to Mr. Kirk, and there were only seven left. Of course you have accounted for that in your theory. How?" <==

That’s obvious. Kirk took it from Vance’s closet. Part of his plan to implicate Vance."
Wolfe nodded. "As Vance intended you to. But have you examined that assumption thoroughly?"
"Yes. I don’t like it. That’s one reason I think the DA is moving too fast. Kirk would have been a sap to do that. Someone else could have taken it to implicate Kirk. For instance, Fougere."

Wolfe grunted. "I challenge that, but first the fourth point. Those neckties were an integral item of James Neville Vance’s projection of his selfhood. Made exclusively for him, they were more than merely distinctive and personal; they were morsels of his ego. Conceivably he might have given one of them to someone close and dear to him, but not to Martin Kirk - not unless it was an essential step in an undertaking of vital importance. So it was."
"Damn it," Cramer growled, "his reason!"

That’s obvious. Kirk took it from Vance’s closet. Part of his plan to implicate Vance."
Wolfe nodded. "As Vance intended you to. But have you examined that assumption thoroughly?"
"Yes. I don’t like it. That’s one reason I think the DA is moving too fast. Kirk would have been a sap to do that. Someone else could have taken it to implicate Kirk. For instance, Fougere."

"Damn it," Cramer growled, "his reason!"
A corner of Wolfe’s mouth went up. "Your new approach is an improvement, Mr. Cramer. You know I wouldn’t fix on a man as a murderer without a motive, so I must have one for Mr. Vance, and you want it. Not now. You would get up and go. That would be enough for you to take to the district attorney, and while it would postpone a murder charge against my client it would by no means clear him permanently, because I strongly doubt if you can get enough evidence against Vance to hold him, let alone convict him. My knowledge of Vance’s motive is by hearsay, so don’t bother to warn me about withholding evidence; I have none that you don’t have. If I get some I’ll be glad to share it. I need to know with certainty where Mr. Vance will be this evening from ten o’clock on, and when Mr. Goodwin told me that you were at the door it occurred to me that the surest way would be for you to have him with you. Do you want it in writing, signed by both of us, that there will be no illegal act - under penalty of losing our licenses?"
Cramer uttered a word about the same flavor as the one Fougere had used, but of

course there was no lady present. He followed it up. "I suppose I’d send it to the Commissioner so he could frame it?" He flattened his palms on the chair arms. "Look, Wolfe. I know you. I know you’ve got something. I admit your four points taken together add up. I’ll take your word that you won’t send Goodwin to break and enter. I know I can’t pry any more out of you even if it wasn’t time for you to eat, and anyway I eat too. But you say I’m to keep Vance until I hear from you or Goodwin, and that might mean all night, and he’s not just some bum. Nothing doing. Make it tomorrow morning, say ten o’clock, and limit it to six hours if I don’t hear from you or Goodwin, and I’ll buy it."

IF YOU EVER NEED an operative and only the best will do, get Saul Panzer if you can. If Saul isn’t available, get Fred Durkin or Orrie Cather. That was the trio who entered James Neville Vance’s apartment with me at a quarter past ten Thursday morning.
What made the entry legal was that when I rang the bells, both downstairs and upstairs, the doors were opened from the inside. Who opened them was Rita Fougere. Upstairs she held it open until we were in and then closed it. I preferred not to touch the door - not that it mattered, but I like things neat.

The door shut, Rita turned to me. She still had those eyes, but the lids were puffy, and her face had had no attention at all. "Where’s Martin?" she asked. Her

 soft little voice was more like a croak. "Have you heard from him?"
==> I shook my head. "As Mr. Wolfe told you last evening, he’s being held as a material witness. Getting a lawyer to arrange for bail would cost money - his money. This will be cheaper and better if it works. Mr. Wolfe told you that." <==
"I know, but... what if it doesn’t?"
"That’s his department." I turned. "This is Mr. Panzer. Mr. Durkin. Mr. Cather. They know who you are. As you know, you’re to stay put, and if you’d like to help you might make some coffee. If the phone rings answer it. If the doorbell rings don’t answer it. Right?"
"Yes."
"Okay. Gentlemen, sic ‘em."
The way you prowl a place depends on what you’re after. If you’re looking for one large item, say a stolen elephant, of course it’s simple. The toughest is when you’re just looking. We did want one specific item, a necktie, but also we wanted anything whatever that might help, no matter what, and Saul and Fred and Orrie had been thoroughly briefed. So we were just looking after Saul found the necktie, and that means things like inspecting the seams of a mattress and unfolding handkerchiefs and flipping through the pages of books. It takes a lot longer when you are leaving everything exactly as it was.

So we were just looking after Saul found the necktie, and that means things like inspecting the seams of a mattress and unfolding handkerchiefs and flipping through the pages of books. It takes a lot longer when you are leaving everything exactly as it was.
We had been at it over an hour when Saul found the tie. I had shown them the seven on the rack in the closet so they would know what it looked like. Saul and Orrie were up in the studio, and when I heard them coming down the spiral stair I knew they had something and met them at the foot, and Saul handed it to me. It was folded, and pinned to it was one of Vance’s engraved letterheads, on which Saul had written: "Found by me at 11:25 A.M. on August 9, 1962, inside a piano score of Scriabin’s Vers la Flamme which was in a cabinet in the studio of James Neville Vance at 219 Horn Street, Manhattan, New York City." He had signed it with his little twirl on the tail of the z.
"You’re my hero," I told him. "It would be an honor to tie your shoestrings and I want your autograph. But you know how Orrie is on gags and so do I. We’ll take a look."

entered the bedroom, with them following, and went to the closet. The seven were still on the rack; I counted them twice. "Okay," I told Saul, "it’s it. I’ll vote for you for President." I took the seven from the rack and handed them to him. "Here, we’ll take them along."
==> After that it was just looking, both in the apartment and in the studio, and that gets tedious. By two o’clock it was damn tedious because we were hungry and we had decided not to take time out to eat, but Cramer had agreed to keep Vance for six hours, and while we had Exhibit A and that was all Wolfe really expected, an Exhibit X would be deeply appreciated. So we kept at it. <==
A little before three o’clock I was standing in the middle of the living room frowning around. Rita was lying on a couch with her eyes closed. Fred was up in the studio with Saul and Orrie. I was trying to remember some little something that had been in my mind an hour ago, and finally I did. When Fred had taken a pile of gloves from a drawer he had looked in each glove but hadn’t felt in it, and he hadn’t taken them to the light. I went to the bedroom, got the gloves from the drawer, took them to the window, and really looked; and in the fifth glove, a pigskin hand-sewed number, there was Exhibit X. When I saw it inside the glove I thought it was just a gob of some kind of junk, but when I pulled it out and saw what it was I felt something I hadn’t felt very often, a hot spot at the base of my spine. I don’t often talk to myself either, but I said aloud, "Believe it or not, that’s exactly what it is. It has to be." I put it back in the glove, put the glove in my pocket, returned the other gloves to the drawer, went to the phone on the bedstand, and dialed a number.
Wolfe’s voice came: "Yes?" I’ve been trying for years to get him to answer the phone properly.
"Me," I said. "We’ll be there in less than half an hour. Saul found the tie. It was in a piano score in a cabinet in the studio. I just found Exhibit X. I can tell you what he did. After he killed her he cut off a lock of her hair with blood on it, plenty of blood, and took it for a keepsake. After the blood was dry he put it inside one of his gloves in a drawer, which is where I found it. That has to be it. You may not believe it till you see it, but you will then."
"Indeed." A pause. "Satisfactory. Very satisfactory. Bring the glove."
"Certainly. A suggestion - or call it a request. Tell Cramer to have him there at a quarter after four, or half past. We’re starving, including Mrs. Fougere, and we

"You know my schedule. I’ll tell Mr. Cramer six o’clock. Fritz will - "
"No." I was emphatic. "For once you’ll have to skip it. The six hours is up at four o’clock, and if you put it off until six Cramer may let him go home, with or without an escort, and he might find that both the tie and the keepsake are gone. Would that be satisfactory?"
Silence. "No." More silence. "Confound it." Still more. "Very well. Fritz will have something ready."
"Better make it half past and - " He had hung up.

==> INSPECTOR CRAMER SETTLED BACK in the red leather chair, narrowed his eyes at Wolfe, and rasped, "I’ve told Mr. Vance that this won’t be on any official record and he can answer your questions or not as he pleases." <==
He wouldn’t have settled back if he had been the only city employee present, since he knew that almost certainly some fur was going to fly. Sergeant Purley Stebbins was there at his right on a chair against the wall. Purley never sits with his back to anyone, even his superior officer, if he can help it. James Neville Vance was on a chair facing Wolfe’s desk, between Cramer and me. Rita Fougere was on the couch at the left of my desk, and Saul and Fred and Orrie were grouped over by the big globe.
"There won’t be many questions," Wolfe told Cramer. "Nothing remains to be satisfied but my curiosity on a point or two." His head turned. "Mr. Vance, only you can satisfy it." To me: "Archie?"
I regretted having to take my eyes away from Vance. Not that I thought he needed watching; it was just that I wanted to. You can learn things, or you think you can, from the face of a man who knows something is headed for him but doesn’t know exactly what and is trying to be ready to meet it. Up to that point Vance’s face hadn’t increased my knowledge of human nature. His lips were drawn in tight, and that made his oversized chin even more out of proportion.

 When Wolfe cued me I had to leave it. I got the seven ties from a drawer, put them in a row on Wolfe’s desk, and stood by.

Sergeant Purley Stebbins was there at his right on a chair against the wall. Purley never sits with his back to anyone, even his superior officer, if he can help it. James Neville Vance was on a chair facing Wolfe’s desk, between Cramer and me. Rita Fougere was on the couch at the left of my desk, and Saul and Fred and Orrie were grouped over by the big globe.
"There won’t be many questions," Wolfe told Cramer. "Nothing remains to be satisfied but my curiosity on a point or two." His head turned. "Mr. Vance, only you can satisfy it." To me: "Archie?"
I regretted having to take my eyes away from Vance. Not that I thought he needed watching; it was just that I wanted to. You can learn things, or you think you can, from the face of a man who knows something is headed for him but doesn’t know exactly what and is trying to be ready to meet it. Up to that point Vance’s face hadn’t increased my knowledge of human nature. His lips were drawn in tight, and that made his oversized chin even more out of proportion.

==>  When Wolfe cued me I had to leave it. I got the seven ties from a drawer, put them in a row on Wolfe’s desk, and stood by. <==
"Those," Wolfe told Vance, "are the seven ties that remained on the rack in your closet. I produce them - "
A growl from Cramer stopped him. It would have stopped anybody. It became words. "So you did. Stebbins, take Mr. Vance out to the car. I want to talk to Wolfe."
"No," Wolfe snapped. "I said there would be no illegal entry and there wasn’t. Mr. Goodwin, accompanied by Mr. Panzer, Mr. Durkin, and Mr. Cather, rang the bell at Mr. Vance’s apartment and were admitted by Mrs. Fougere. She was in the apartment with Mr. Vance’s knowledge and consent, having gone there earlier to talk with him. When an officer came to take him to you she remained, with no objection from him. Is that correct, Mrs. Fougere?"
"Yes." It came out a whisper, and she repeated it. "Yes." That time it was a croak.
"Is that correct, Mr. Vance?"

No comment. No response.
"Let me see that," Cramer growled. Of course he would; that’s why I was standing by. I took it from Wolfe and handed it over. He read the statement, twisted around for a look at Saul, and twisted the other way to hand the exhibit to Stebbins.

It’s just as well I haven’t many questions," Wolfe told Vance, "since apparently the few I do have won’t be answered. I’ll try answering them myself, and if you care to correct me, do so. I invite interruptions."
He cocked his head. "You realize, sir, that the facts are manifest. The problem is not what you did, or when or how, but why. As for when, you typed that envelope and message to Mr. Goodwin, using your own stationery and having found or made an opportunity to use Mr. Kirk’s typewriter, at least three weeks ago, since that machine wasn’t available after July nineteenth. Mr. Kirk’s disposing of it just then was of course coincidental. So your undertaking was not only premeditated, it was carefully planned. Also you retrieved the tie you had given Mr. Kirk before he moved from his apartment. Using the typewriter and retrieving the tie of course presented no difficulty, since you owned the house and had master keys. Any comment?"

Wolfe nodded. "That’s your rebuttal, naturally. You intended the necktie maneuver to appear as a clumsy stratagem by Mr. Kirk to implicate you. So of course a tie had to be missing from the rack in your closet. But if Mr. Kirk had taken it he wouldn’t have hidden it in your studio; he would have destroyed it. Why then didn’t you destroy it? You know; I don’t; but I can guess. You thought it possible that the situation might so develop that you could somehow use it, so why not keep it?"

Wolfe turned a hand over. "Now the primary why: why did you kill her? I learned yesterday that you probably had an adequate motive, but as I told Mr. Cramer, that was only hearsay. I had to have a demonstrable fact, an act or an object, and you supplied it. Not yesterday or today; you supplied it Tuesday afternoon when, after killing Mrs. Kirk, you stooped over her battered skull, or knelt or squatted, and cut off a lock of her hair, choosing one that had her blood on it. With a knife, or scissors? Did you stoop, or squat, or kneel?"
Vance’s lips moved, but no sound came. Unquestionably he was trying to say "I didn’t" but couldn’t make it.
Wolfe grunted. "I said a demonstrable fact. To demonstrate is to establish as true, and I’ll establish it. Mr. Goodwin found the lock of hair, caked with blood, some two hours ago, in a drawer in your bedroom.

 from the drawer I started too, but I wasn’t expecting him to dart like lightning, and he did; and he got the glove, snatched it out of Wolfe’s hand. Of course he didn’t keep it long. I came from his left side and Purley from his right, and since he had the glove in his right hand it was Purley who got his wrist and twisted it, and the glove dropped to the floor.

I can move fast and so can Purley Stebbins, but we both misjudged James Neville Vance, at least I did. When he started up at sight of the glove Wolfe took

 from the drawer I started too, but I wasn’t expecting him to dart like lightning, and he did; and he got the glove, snatched it out of Wolfe’s hand. Of course he didn’t keep it long. I came from his left side and Purley from his right, and since he had the glove in his right hand it was Purley who got his wrist and twisted it, and the glove dropped to the floor.
Cramer picked it up. Purley had Vance by the right arm, and I had him by the left.
Wolfe stood up. "It’s in the glove," he told Cramer. "Mr. Goodwin, will furnish any details you require, and Mrs. Fougere." He headed for the door. The clock said 5:22. His schedule had hit a snag, but by gum it wasn’t wrecked.

"I didn’t phone him."
I must say that Vance was showing more gumption than I had expected. By letting Wolfe talk he was finding out exactly how deep the hole was, and he was saying nothing.
Wolfe turned a hand over. "Now the primary why: why did you kill her? I learned yesterday that you probably had an adequate motive, but as I told Mr. Cramer, that was only hearsay. I had to have a demonstrable fact, an act or an object, and you supplied it. Not yesterday or today; you supplied it Tuesday afternoon when, after killing Mrs. Kirk, you stooped over her battered skull, or knelt or squatted, and cut off a lock of her hair, choosing one that had her blood on it. With a knife, or scissors? Did you stoop, or squat, or kneel?"
Vance’s lips moved, but no sound came. Unquestionably he was trying to say "I didn’t" but couldn’t make it.

A LITTLE BEFORE FIVE o’clock one afternoon last week the doorbell rang, and through the one-way glass I saw Martin Kirk on the stoop, his overcoat collar turned up and his hat on tight. When I opened the door snow came whirling in. Obviously he was calling on me, not Wolfe, since he knew the schedule, and I was glad to see an ex-client who had paid his bill promptly, so I took his hat and coat and put them on the rack, and ushered him to the office and a chair. When we had exchanged a few remarks about the weather, and his health and mine, and Wolfe’s, and he had declined an offer of a drink, he said he saw that Vance’s lawyer was trying a new approach on an appeal, and I said yeah, when you’ve got money you can do a lot of dodging. With that disposed of, he said he often wondered where he would be now if he hadn’t come straight to Wolfe from the DA’s office that day in August.
"Look," I said, "you’ve said that before. I have all the time there is and I enjoy your company, but you didn’t come all the way here through the worst storm this winter just to chew the fat. Something on your mind?"

REX STOUT
==> NATURALLY MOST OF THE ITEMS in the mail that is delivered to the old brownstone on West 35th Street are addressed to Nero Wolfe, but since I both work and live there eight or ten out of a hundred are addressed to me. It is my custom to let my share wait until after I have opened Wolfe’s, looked it over, and put it on his desk, but sometimes curiosity butts in. As it did that Tuesday morning when I came to an elegant cream-colored envelope, outsize, addressed to me on a typewriter, with the return address in the corner engraved in dark brown: <==
JAMES NEVILLE VANCE
Two Nineteen Horn Street New York 12 New York
Never heard of him. It wasn’t flat; it bulged with something soft inside. Like everybody else, I occasionally get envelopes containing samples of something that bulges them, but not expensive envelopes with engraving that isn’t phony. So I slit it open and removed the contents. A folded sheet of paper that matched the envelope, including the engraved name and address, had a message typed in the center:
Archie Goodwin - Keep this until you hear from me. JNV
"This" was a necktie, a four-in-hand, neatly folded to go in the envelope. I stretched it out - long, narrow, maybe silk, light tan, almost the same color as the stationery, with thin brown diagonal lines. A Sutcliffe label, so certainly silk, say twenty bucks. But he should have sent it to the cleaners instead of me, because it had a spot, a big one two inches long, near one end, about the same tone of brown as the thin lines; but the lines’ brown was clean and live and the spot’s brown was dirty and dead. I sniffed at it, but I am not a beagle. Having seen a few dried bloodstains here and there, I knew the dirty color was right, but that’s

"This" was a necktie, a four-in-hand, neatly folded to go in the envelope. I stretched it out - long, narrow, maybe silk, light tan, almost the same color as the stationery, with thin brown diagonal lines. A Sutcliffe label, so certainly silk, say twenty bucks. But he should have sent it to the cleaners instead of me, because it had a spot, a big one two inches long, near one end, about the same tone of brown as the thin lines; but the lines’ brown was clean and live and the spot’s brown was dirty and dead. I sniffed at it, but I am not a beagle. Having seen a few dried bloodstains here and there, I knew the dirty color was right, but that’s

 no phenolphthalin test. Even so, I told myself as I dropped the tie in a drawer, supposing that James Neville Vance worked in a butcher shop and forgot his bib, why pick on me? As I closed the drawer I shrugged.
That’s the way to take it when you get a bloodstained (maybe) necktie in the mail from a stranger, just shrug, but I admit that in the next couple of hours I did something and didn’t do something else. What I did do was ring Lon Cohen at the Gazette to ask a question, and an hour later he called back to say that James Neville Vance, now in his late fifties, still owned all the real estate he had inherited from his father, still spent winters on the Riviera, and was still a bachelor; and what did he want of a private detective? I reserved that. What I didn’t do was take a walk. When nothing is stirring and Wolfe has given me no program I usually go out after the routine morning chores to work my legs and have a look at the town and my fellow men, not to mention women, but that morning I skipped it because JNV might come or phone. It had been an honest shrug, but you can’t shrug all day.
I might as well have had my walk because the phone call didn’t come until a quarter past eleven, after Wolfe had come down to the office from his two-hour morning session with the orchids up in the plant rooms on the roof. He had put a spray of Cymbidium Doris in the vase on his desk and got his personal seventh of a ton disposed in his oversize custom-made chair, and was scowling at the dust jacket of a book, one of the items that had been addressed to him, when the phone rang and I got it.
==> "Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie Goodwin speaking." "Is this Archie Goodwin?" <==
Three people out of ten will do that. I am always tempted to say no, it’s a trained dog, and see what comes next, but I might get barked at. So I said, "It is. In person."
"This is James Neville Vance. Did you receive something in the mail from me?"
His voice couldn’t decide whether to be a squeak or a falsetto and had the worst features of both. "Yes, presumably," I said. "Your envelope and letterhead."
"And an enclosure." "Right."

It was a baritone, no trace of a squeak. I told the grill, "I have something that belongs to you and I want to return it."
"You have something that belongs to me?" "Right."
"What is it and where did you get it?"
"Correction. I think it belongs to you. It’s a four-in-hand silk tie, Sutcliffe label, the same color as this house, with diagonal lines the same color as the trim. Cream and brown."
"Who are you and where did you get it?"
==> I got impatient. "Here’s a suggestion," I said. "Install closed-circuit television so you can see the vestibule from up there, and phone me at the office of Nero Wolfe, where I work, and I’ll come back. It will take a week or so and set you back ten grand, but it’ll be worth it to see the tie without letting me in. After you’ve identified it I’ll tell you where I got it. If you don’t - " <==
"Did you say Nero Wolfe? The detective?"


"Yes."
"But what - This is ridiculous."

"It must be mine. I can settle that. Come along."
He headed for the rear and I followed, back beyond the second piano, and then down spiral stairs, wide for a spiral, with carpeted steps and a polished wooden rail. At the bottom, the rear end of a good-sized living room, he turned right through an open door and we were in a bedroom. He crossed to another door and opened it, and I stopped two steps off. It was a walk-in closet. A friend of mine once told me that a woman’s clothes closet will tell you more about her than any other room in the house, and if that goes for a man too there was my chance to get the lowdown on James Neville Vance, but I was interested only in his neckties. They were on a rack at the right, three rows of them, quite an assortment, some cream and brown but by no means all. He fingered through part of one row, repeated it, turned and emerged, and said, "It’s mine. I had nine and gave one to somebody, and there are only seven." He shook his head. "I can’t imagine ..." He let it hang. "What on earth ..." He let that hang too.
"And your stationery," I said.
"Yes. Of course."
"And the phone call telling me to burn it. With a squeak." "Yes. You asked if I had any ideas or suggestions. Have you?"
==> "I could have, but they would be expensive. I work for Nero Wolfe and it would be on his time, and the bill would be bad news. You must know who has access to your stationery and that closet, and you ought to be able to make some kind of a guess about who and why. And you won’t need the tie. It came to me in the mail, so actually and legally it’s in my possession, and I ought to keep it." I put a hand out. "If you don’t mind?" <==
"Of course." He handed it over. "But I might - You’re not going to burn it?"
"No indeed." I stuck it in my side pocket. The envelope and letterhead were back in my breast pocket. "I have a little collection of souvenirs. If and when you have occasion to produce it for - "
A bell tinkled somewhere, a soft music tinkle, possibly music of the future. He frowned and turned and started for the front, and I followed, back through the

 open door, and across the living room to another door, which he opened. Two men were there in a little foyer - one a square little guy in shirt sleeves and brown denim pants, and the other, also square but big, a harness bull.

"No, sir. I took it to Ludlow and it’s human blood. So I gave it to Cramer. Of
course you’ve read the Times?" "Yes."
"The blood is the same type as Mrs. Kirk’s. If it was or is a floundering numskull, obviously I’d better see - "
The doorbell rang.
I got up and went, telling myself it was even money it was James Neville Vance, but it wasn’t. A glance at the one-way glass panel in the front door settled that. It was a panhandler who had run out of luck and started ringing doorbells - a tall, lanky one pretending he had to lean against the jamb to keep himself upright. Opening the door, I said politely, "It’s a hard life. Good morning."
==> He got me in focus with bleary eyes and said, "I would like to see Nero Wolfe. <==

 My name is Martin Kirk."
If you think I should have recognized him from the pictures Lon had shown me, I don’t agree. You should have seen him. I told him Mr. Wolfe saw people only by appointment, but I’d ask. "You’re the Martin Kirk who lives at Two-nineteen Horn Street?"
He said he was, and I invited him in, ushered him into the front room and to a seat, which he evidently needed, went to the office by way of the connecting door, closed the door, and crossed to Wolfe’s desk. "I’m on my own time now," I told him. "It’s Martin Kirk. He asked to see you, but of course you’re not interested. May I use the front room?"
He took a deep breath, in through his nose and out through his mouth, then glared at me for five seconds and growled, "Bring him in."

"But you don’t - " "Bring him."
==> Unheard of. Absolutely contrary to nature - his nature. The Nero Wolfe I thought I knew would at least have wanted me to pump him first. With a genius you never know. As I returned to the front room and told Kirk to come, I decided that the idea must be to show me that I would be a sap to waste my time. He would make short work of Martin Kirk. So as Kirk flopped into the red leather chair near the end of Wolfe’s desk he snapped at him, "Well, sir? I have read the morning paper. Why do you come to me?" <==
Kirk pressed the heels of his palms against his eyes. He groaned. He lowered his hands and the bleary eyes blinked a dozen times. "You’ll have to make allowances," he said. "I just left the district attorney’s office. I was there all night and no sleep."
"Have you eaten?" "My God no."
Wolfe made a face. That complicated it. The mere thought of a man going without food was disagreeable, and to have one there in his house was intolerable. He had to either get him out in a hurry or feed him. "Why should I

 make allowances?" he demanded.

"That’s what I want, your services."
"You want to hire me to investigate this affair?" "Yes. That’s why I’m here."
"And you can pay me without undue strain?" "Yes. I have - Yes. Do you want a check now?"

 thousand dollars will do as a retainer."
==> I had to shut my eyes a second to keep from gawking. That wasn’t only unheard of, it was unbelievable. Taking on a job, which meant that he would have to work, without the usual dodging and stalling - that could be on account of the lag in receipts; but taking a murder suspect for a client offhand, no questions asked but the routine did you kill her and can you pay me, without the faintest notion whether he was guilty or not and how much the cops had on him - that simply wasn’t done, not by anybody, let alone Nero Wolfe. I had to clamp my teeth on my lip to sit and take it. As Kirk got out a checkfold and a pen Wolfe pushed a button on his desk, and in a moment Fritz came. <==
"A tray, please," Wolfe told him. "The madrilène is ready?" "Yes, sir."
"And the pudding?"
"Yes, sir."
"A bowl of each, cheese with water cress, and hot tea."
When Fritz turned and went I would have liked to go along, to tell him that there could be something worse than having no client.

 to a bar and bought a drink but didn’t drink it. I wanted to know if her things were there, and I thought of phoning Jimmy Vance, but finally decided to phone police headquarters instead. Even if they found her there and someone with her, that might - "
The doorbell rang, and I went, again giving myself even money that it was Vance, and losing again. It was a girl, or woman, and she had a kind of eyes that I had met only twice before, once a woman and once a man. I have a habit, when it’s a stranger on the stoop, of taking a five-second look through the one-way glass and tagging him or her, to see how close I can come. From inside, the view through the glass is practically clear, but from the outside it might as well be wood. But she could see through. Of course she couldn’t, but she was face-to- face with me, and her eyes, slanted up, had exactly the look they would have if she were seeing me. They were nice enough hazel eyes, but I hadn’t liked it the other two times it had happened, and I didn’t like it then. Not trying to tag her, I opened the door.
"I beg your pardon," she said. "I believe Mr. Kirk is here? Martin Kirk?"
It wasn’t possible. They wouldn’t put a female dick on his tail, and even if they did she wouldn’t be it, with that attractive little face and soft little voice. But there she was. "I beg your pardon," I said, "but what makes you think so?"
"He must be. I saw him come in and I haven’t seen him come out." "Then he’s here. And?"
==> "Would you mind telling me whose house - who lives here?" "Nero Wolfe. It’s his house and he lives here." <==
"That’s an odd name. Nero Wolfe? What does he - Is he a lawyer?"
Either she meant it or she was extremely good. If the former, it would be a pleasure to tell Wolfe and see him grunt. "No," I said. Let her work for it.
"Is Mr. Kirk all right?"

The doorbell rang, and I went, again giving myself even money that it was Vance, and losing again. It was a girl, or woman, and she had a kind of eyes that I had met only twice before, once a woman and once a man. I have a habit, when it’s a stranger on the stoop, of taking a five-second look through the one-way glass and tagging him or her, to see how close I can come. From inside, the view through the glass is practically clear, but from the outside it might as well be wood. But she could see through. Of course she couldn’t, but she was face-to- face with me, and her eyes, slanted up, had exactly the look they would have if she were seeing me. They were nice enough hazel eyes, but I hadn’t liked it the other two times it had happened, and I didn’t like it then. Not trying to tag her, I opened the door.
"I beg your pardon," she said. "I believe Mr. Kirk is here? Martin Kirk?"
It wasn’t possible. They wouldn’t put a female dick on his tail, and even if they did she wouldn’t be it, with that attractive little face and soft little voice. But there she was. "I beg your pardon," I said, "but what makes you think so?"
"He must be. I saw him come in and I haven’t seen him come out." "Then he’s here. And?"
"Would you mind telling me whose house - who lives here?" "Nero Wolfe. It’s his house and he lives here."
==> "That’s an odd name. Nero Wolfe? What does he - Is he a lawyer?" <==
Either she meant it or she was extremely good. If the former, it would be a pleasure to tell Wolfe and see him grunt. "No," I said. Let her work for it.
"Is Mr. Kirk all right?"
"We haven’t been introduced," I said. "My name is Archie Goodwin and I live here. Your turn."

"We haven’t been introduced," I said. "My name is Archie Goodwin and I live here. Your turn."


Her mouth opened and closed again. She considered it, her eyes meeting mine exactly as they had when she couldn’t see me. "I’m Rita Fougere," she said. "Mrs. Paul Fougere. Will you tell Mr. Kirk I’m here and would like to see him?"
It was my turn to consider. The rule didn’t apply - the rule that I am to take no one in to Wolfe without consulting him; she wanted to see Kirk, not Wolfe. And I was riled. The tie had been mailed to me, not him, but he hadn’t even glanced at me before taking Kirk on and feeding him. I was by no means satisfied that Kirk was straight, and I wanted to see how he took it when Paul Fougere’s wife suddenly appeared.
==> "You might as well tell him yourself," I said. "Also you might as well know that Nero Wolfe is a private detective, and so am I. Come in." <==
I made room for her and she entered, and after shutting the door I preceded her down the hall and into the office. As I approached Wolfe’s desk I said, "Someone to see Mr. Kirk," and I was right there when he twisted around and saw her, said "Rita!" and left the chair. She offered both hands, and he took them. "Martin, Martin," she said, low, with those eyes at him.
"But how ..." He let her hands go. "How did you know I was here?" "I followed you."
"Followed me?"
She nodded. "From down there. I was there too, and when I left and had got into a taxi you came out. I called to you but you didn’t hear me, and when you got another taxi I told my driver to follow. I saw you come in here, and I waited outside, and when you didn’t come out, a whole hour - "
"But what - You shouldn’t, Rita. You can’t - There’s nothing you can do. Were you there all night too?"

"But what - You shouldn’t, Rita. You can’t - There’s nothing you can do. Were you there all night too?"
"No, just this morning. I was afraid - your face, the way you looked. I was terribly afraid. I know I can’t - or maybe I can. If you’ll come - Have you eaten anything?"
==> "Yes. I thought I couldn’t, but Nero Wolfe - " He stopped and turned. "I’m sorry. Mr. Wolfe, Mrs. Fougere." Back to her: "They think I killed Bonny, but I didn’t, <==

 and Mr. Wolfe is going to - uh - investigate. That’s a swell word, that is - ’investigate.’ There’s nothing you can do, Rita, absolutely nothing, but I - you’re a real friend."
She started a hand to touch him but let it drop. "I’ll wait for you," she said. "I’ll be outside."
"If you please." It was Wolfe. His eyes were at the client. "You have a chore, Mr. Kirk. I need to know if that article is among your belongings in your room, and you will please go and find out and phone me. Meanwhile I’ll talk with Mrs. Fougere. If you will, madam? I’m working for Mr. Kirk."
"Why ..." She looked at Kirk. Those eyes. "If he’s working for you..."

"Martin?"
"Yes. Rita?"
"Yes. Where are you?"
"In my room at the hotel. You’re still there?"
"Yes. What are you going to do? Are you going to your office?"
==> "Good Lord no. I’m going to see Jimmy Vance. Then I’m going to see Nero Wolfe again. Someone has - " <==
I cut in. "Hold it. I’ve told Mr. Wolfe and he’ll have instructions. Hold the wire." I turned. "He says he’s going to see Vance. Shall I tell him to lay off or will you?"
"Neither. He’s had no sleep and not much to eat. Tell him to come this evening, say nine o’clock, if he’s awake, and report on his talk with Mr. Vance."
"You tell him," I said and hung up. Being a salaried employee, I should of course keep my place in the presence of company, and that’s exactly what I was doing, keeping my place. I had had enough and then some, and Wolfe’s glare, which of course came automatically, was wasted because my head was turned and he had my profile, including the set of my jaw. When Rita was through with the phone he took it, spoke briefly with his client, cradled it, and looked at the clock. Six minutes to lunch.

Do you want me any more?" she asked him. "I’d like to go." "Later perhaps," he said. "If you’ll phone a little after six?"

WHEN YOU’RE GOOD and sore at someone it’s simple. You cuss him out, to his face if he’s available and privately if he isn’t, and you take steps if and as you can. When you’re sore at yourself it’s even simpler; the subject is right there and can’t skip. But when you’re sore at yourself and someone else at the same time you’re in a fix. If you try to concentrate on one the other one horns in and gets you off balance, and that was the state I was in as I stood aside in the vestibule of Two-nineteen Horn Street while Rita Fougere used her key on the door. In the taxi on the way down I had told her about the necktie problem. She might as well get it from me as later from Kirk, and she might as well understand why Kirk wanted to see Vance.
I supposed she would want to go first to her own apartment on the ground floor; surely any woman would whose face needed attention as much as hers - but no. Straight to the elevator and up, and out at the third floor, and she pressed the button at Vance’s door. It opened, and Vance was there. His face wasn’t as neat and smooth as it had been the day before, and he had on a different outfit - a conservative gray suit, a white shirt, and a plain gray tie. Of course the DA’s office had had him down too. He said "Rita!" and put out a hand, then saw me, but I can’t say what kind of a welcome I would have got because Kirk interrupted, stepping over and telling Rita she shouldn’t have come. She said something, but he wasn’t listening because he had noticed me.
==> "I’m glad you’re here," he said. "It’s not very clear in my mind, what Nero Wolfe told me about the tie. I was just going to tell Vance about him. Rita, please! You can’t - this is my trouble." <==
"Listen, Martin," she said, "you shouldn’t be here. I know now why they think it was one of us, so it’s our trouble. You should leave it to him - Nero Wolfe. You shouldn’t be talking about it with anybody, not even me. Isn’t that right, Mr. Goodwin?"
"Mr. Wolfe knew he was coming," I said. I have mentioned that I was sore. "Mr. Wolfe has been called a wizard by various people, and with a wizard you never know. Of course he had me come." I had to force my tongue to let that through, but a private scrap should be kept private.
Vance was frowning at me. "Nero Wolfe had you come? Here?"

"I went to him," Kirk said. "He told me about the necktie. That’s what I want to ask you about. You remember you gave me one, one of those - "
A bell tinkled. I was between Vance and the door, and I moved to let him by. He opened the door and a man stepped in, darted a glance around, and squeaked, "What, a party? A hell of a time for a party, Jimmy."
I say he squeaked because he did, but it was obviously his natural squeak, not the kind on the phone that had told me to burn the tie, though it didn’t fit his six feet and broad shoulders and handsome, manly face. "It’s no party, Paul," Vance told him, but Paul ignored him and was at Rita. "My pet, you’re a perfect fright. You look godawful." He wheeled to Kirk. "And look at you, Martin my boy. Only why not? Why are you still loose?" He looked at me. "Are you a cop?"

That’s true love. Martin the Great had hit him, so he must be in a bad way. It

 would have been a shame to tell her it had been just pecks. I said no, he’d probably make it, and went to help Kirk examine his knuckles. They weren’t so bad.
"Why didn’t you stop them?" Vance demanded.
"I thought I did," I said. "With a mauler like Kirk you have to time it."
==> "I wouldn’t have thought..." He let it go. "Did you say he went to Nero Wolfe?" <==
"No, he did. But I can confirm it, I was present. He has hired Nero Wolfe. That’s why I’m here. I am collecting information that will establish the innocence of Mr. Wolfe’s client. Have you got any?"
"I’m afraid I haven’t." He was frowning. "But of course he is innocent. What Paul Fougere said, that’s ridiculous. I hope he didn’t tell the police that. But with their experience, I don’t suppose - "
The bell tinkled. Vance went to the door and opened it, and in came the law. Anyone with half an eye would know it was the law even if they had never seen or heard of Sergeant Purley Stebbins. Two steps in he stopped for a look and saw me.
"Yeah," he said, "I thought so. You and Wolfe are going to be good and sick of this one. I hope you try to hang on." His eyes went right. Fougere had appeared at the rear of the room. "Everybody, huh? I’m sorry to interrupt, Mr. Vance."
He moved. "You’re wanted downtown for more questions, Mr. Kirk. I’ll take you."

"Okay. We want you to identify the one you traded in. Come along."

 "Are you arresting me?"
"If you prefer it that way I can. Material witness. Or if you balk I’ll phone for a warrant and keep you company till it comes, maybe an hour. With Goodwin here I’ve got to toe the line. He’s hell on wheels, Goodwin is."
Kirk made it to his feet. "All right," he mumbled. He had been without sleep for thirty hours and maybe more. Rita Fougere aimed those eyes at me.
==> I bowed out. Being hell on wheels is fine and dandy if you have anywhere to steer for, but I hadn’t. I went and opened the door and on out, took the elevator down, exchanged no greeting with the driver of the police car out front, though we had met, walked till I found a taxi, and told the hackie 618 West 35th Street; and when he said that was Nero Wolfe’s house I actually said such is fame. That’s the shape I was in. <==
Wolfe was at table in the dining room, putting a gob of his favorite cheese on a wafer. When I entered he looked up and said politely, "Fritz is keeping the kidneys warm."
I stopped three steps in. "Many thanks," I said even more politely. "You were right as usual; the conversation was futile. They had a tail on Kirk, here and to the hotel and on to Horn Street. When Purley Stebbins arrived at Vance’s apartment he knew Kirk was there and he wasn’t surprised to see me. He had come for your client and took him. They have found the typewriter that addressed that envelope to me and the message. It belonged to Kirk, but on July nineteenth he traded it in on another one. Since you don’t talk business at meals, I’ll eat in the kitchen."
I wheeled, hell on wheels, and went to the kitchen.

NEARLY FOUR HOURS LATER, at six o’clock, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Fougere were in the office, waiting for Wolfe to come down from the plant rooms - she in the red leather chair and he in one of the yellow ones in front of Wolfe’s desk. To my surprise he had two marks, a red slightly puffed nose and a little bruise under his left eye. I hadn’t thought Kirk had shown that much power, but of course with bare knuckles it doesn’t take much.

Cut. I hadn’t expected him to open up, since he is as pigheaded as I am steadfast, but he could have made some little comment. As I looked up the Fougere number and dialed it, I was actually considering something I had never done and thought I never would: retract, apologize, and ask him please to tell me, as a favor to an old associate and loyal assistant, what the hell was in his mind, if anything. But of course I didn’t. When I hung up after getting no answer from the Fougere number, I had an idea: I would ask him if he wanted me to phone Parker. With a client collared as a material witness and probably headed for the coop on a murder charge, it should be not only routine but automatic for him to

 get Parker. But I looked at his face as he sat, comfortable, his eyes on the book, and vetoed it. He would merely say no and go on reading. It would have improved my feelings to pick up something and throw it at him, but not the situation, so I arose, went to the hall and up two flights to my room, stood at the window, and reviewed the past thirty hours, trying to spot the catch I had missed, granting there had been one. The trouble was I was sore. You can work when you’re sore, or eat or sleep or fight, but you can’t think straight.
My next sight of Wolfe was at two minutes past six when the elevator brought him down from the plant rooms and he entered the office. The slander approach had got results. The fifth time I tried the Fougere number, a little after four, Paul had answered, and I poured it on. On the phone his squeak sounded more like the one that had told me to burn the tie, but of course it would. A voice on a phone, unless it’s one you know well, is tricky. He said he’d come. An hour later Rita phoned. She was too frantic to be practical. She wanted to know if we had heard from Kirk, and were we doing anything and if so what, and shouldn’t Kirk have a lawyer. Being sore, I told her Wolfe was responsible to his client, not to her, that Kirk would of course need a lawyer, if and when he was charged with something, and that we were expecting her husband at six o’clock. When she said she knew that and she was coming along, I said she might as well have saved the dime. I am rude to people only when I am being rude to myself, or they have asked for it. I admit she hadn’t asked for it.
For Wolfe, being rude is no problem at all. When he entered he detoured around the red leather chair to his desk, gave Rita a nod, sat, narrowed his eyes at the husband, and snapped, "You’re Paul Fougere?"
==> It’s hard to snap back with a squeak, but Fougere did the best he could with what he had. "You’re Nero Wolfe?" <==
"I am. Did you kill that woman?"
I had known when I let them in that Fougere had decided on his line. It’s easy to see when a man’s all set. So the unexpected question flustered him. "You know damn well I didn’t," he said. "You know who did, or you ought to."
"Possibly I don’t. Do you?"
Fougere looked at his wife, at me, and back at Wolfe. He was adjusting. "You’d like that, wouldn’t you?" he said. "With witnesses. All right, I can’t prove it, and

REX STOUT
NATURALLY MOST OF THE ITEMS in the mail that is delivered to the old brownstone on West 35th Street are addressed to Nero Wolfe, but since I both work and live there eight or ten out of a hundred are addressed to me. It is my custom to let my share wait until after I have opened Wolfe’s, looked it over, and put it on his desk, but sometimes curiosity butts in. As it did that Tuesday morning when I came to an elegant cream-colored envelope, outsize, addressed to me on a typewriter, with the return address in the corner engraved in dark brown:
JAMES NEVILLE VANCE
Two Nineteen Horn Street New York 12 New York
Never heard of him. It wasn’t flat; it bulged with something soft inside. Like everybody else, I occasionally get envelopes containing samples of something that bulges them, but not expensive envelopes with engraving that isn’t phony. So I slit it open and removed the contents. A folded sheet of paper that matched the envelope, including the engraved name and address, had a message typed in the center:
==> Archie Goodwin - Keep this until you hear from me. JNV <==
"This" was a necktie, a four-in-hand, neatly folded to go in the envelope. I stretched it out - long, narrow, maybe silk, light tan, almost the same color as the stationery, with thin brown diagonal lines. A Sutcliffe label, so certainly silk, say twenty bucks. But he should have sent it to the cleaners instead of me, because it had a spot, a big one two inches long, near one end, about the same tone of brown as the thin lines; but the lines’ brown was clean and live and the spot’s brown was dirty and dead. I sniffed at it, but I am not a beagle. Having seen a few dried bloodstains here and there, I knew the dirty color was right, but that’s

 no phenolphthalin test. Even so, I told myself as I dropped the tie in a drawer, supposing that James Neville Vance worked in a butcher shop and forgot his bib, why pick on me? As I closed the drawer I shrugged.
That’s the way to take it when you get a bloodstained (maybe) necktie in the mail from a stranger, just shrug, but I admit that in the next couple of hours I did something and didn’t do something else. What I did do was ring Lon Cohen at the Gazette to ask a question, and an hour later he called back to say that James Neville Vance, now in his late fifties, still owned all the real estate he had inherited from his father, still spent winters on the Riviera, and was still a bachelor; and what did he want of a private detective? I reserved that. What I didn’t do was take a walk. When nothing is stirring and Wolfe has given me no program I usually go out after the routine morning chores to work my legs and have a look at the town and my fellow men, not to mention women, but that morning I skipped it because JNV might come or phone. It had been an honest shrug, but you can’t shrug all day.
I might as well have had my walk because the phone call didn’t come until a quarter past eleven, after Wolfe had come down to the office from his two-hour morning session with the orchids up in the plant rooms on the roof. He had put a spray of Cymbidium Doris in the vase on his desk and got his personal seventh of a ton disposed in his oversize custom-made chair, and was scowling at the dust jacket of a book, one of the items that had been addressed to him, when the phone rang and I got it.

==> "Nero Wolfe’s office, Archie Goodwin speaking." "Is this Archie Goodwin?" <==
Three people out of ten will do that. I am always tempted to say no, it’s a trained dog, and see what comes next, but I might get barked at. So I said, "It is. In person."
"This is James Neville Vance. Did you receive something in the mail from me?"
His voice couldn’t decide whether to be a squeak or a falsetto and had the worst features of both. "Yes, presumably," I said. "Your envelope and letterhead."
"And an enclosure." "Right."

"In the Village. Thirty-minute walk. I’ve had no walk." "Very well." He opened the book.


32
MOST OF THE HOUSES on Horn Street, which is only three blocks long, could stand a coat of paint, but Number 219, a four-story brick, was all dressed up - the brick cream-colored and the trim dark brown; and the Venetian blinds at the windows matched the bricks. Since Vance was in clover I supposed it was just for him, but in the vestibule there were three names in a panel on the wall with buttons. The bottom one was Fougere, the middle one was Kirk, and the top one was James Neville Vance. I pushed the top one, and after a wait a voice came from a grill. "Who is it?"
==> I stooped a little to put my mouth on a level with the lower grill and said, "My name is Archie Goodwin. I’d like to see Mr. Vance." <==
"This is Vance. What do you want?"
It was a baritone, no trace of a squeak. I told the grill, "I have something that belongs to you and I want to return it."
"You have something that belongs to me?" "Right."
"What is it and where did you get it?"
"Correction. I think it belongs to you. It’s a four-in-hand silk tie, Sutcliffe label, the same color as this house, with diagonal lines the same color as the trim. Cream and brown."

 for the first seven months of nineteen sixty-two is nine grand behind nineteen sixty-one. I am performing one of the main functions you pay me for."
"Not brilliantly," he said and picked up the book. Merely a childish gesture, since Fritz would enter in eight minutes to announce lunch. I went and opened the safe and stashed my souvenirs on a shelf in the inner compartment.
43
INSPECTOR CRAMER of Homicide South came at ten minutes past six.
I had been functioning all afternoon, I don’t say brilliantly. During lunch, in the dining room across the hall, while listening to Wolfe’s table talk with one ear, I decided to make myself scarce while I considered the matter. There was no sense in getting out on a limb just for the hell of it, and a homicide dick might show any minute, so as we left the table I told Wolfe that since we had no expectations or desires I was going out on some personal chores. He gave me a sharp glance, made a face, and headed for the office. As I was turning to the front the phone rang and I went in and got it. If it was the DA’s office inviting me to call, I would make up my mind on the way downtown.
==> It was Lon Cohen. He had compliments. "No question about it, Archie," he said, "you’d be worth your weight in blood rubies to any newspaper in town, especially the Gazette. At nine-thirty you phone for dope on James Neville Vance. At twelve-twenty, less than three hours later, a cop finds a body in his house and both you and he are present. Marvelous. Any leg man can find out what happened, but knowing what’s going to happen - you’re one in ten million. What’s on the program for tomorrow? I only want a day at a time." <==
I was a little short with him because my problem was the program for today.
I was out of the house and halfway to Eighth Avenue, no destination in mind, when I realized I was ignoring the main point - no, two main points. One, if a dick came before Wolfe went up to the plant rooms at four o’clock, Wolfe might possibly give him the souvenirs, to keep me out of trouble. Two, if the spot on the tie wasn’t blood and its being sent to me was just some kind of a gag, and it had no connection with a murder, I was stewing about nothing. So I turned and went back. Wolfe, at his desk with his book, apparently paid no attention as I opened the safe and took out the souvenirs, but of course he saw. I pocketed

 them and left.
Twenty minutes later I was seated in a room on the tenth floor of a building on 43rd Street, telling a man at a desk, "This is for me personally, Mr. Hirsh, not for Mr. Wolfe, but it’s possible that he may have a use for it before long." I put the tie on the desk and pointed to the spot. "How long will it take to tell what that is?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74005    window = 74000 74010


So, I told myself as I got the lobster out, I got not only my money’s worth but my time’s worth, and by the time I was upstairs and in my pajamas I had decided that if Wolfe wasn’t interested I certainly was, and I was going to find out who had sent me that tie even if I had to take a month’s leave of absence.
Except in emergencies I get a full eight hours’ sleep, and that was merely a project, not an emergency, so I didn’t get down for breakfast, which I eat in the kitchen, until after ten o’clock. As I got orange juice from the refrigerator and Fritz started the burner under the cake griddle he asked where I had dined, and I said he knew darned well I hadn’t dined at all, since I had phoned that I was at the DA’s office, and he nodded and said, "These clients in trouble."
"Look, Fritz," I told him, "you’re a chef, not a diplomat, so why do you keep that up? You know we’ve had no client for a month and you want to know if we’ve hooked one, so why don’t you just ask? Repeat after me, ‘Have we got a client?’

 Try it."
==> "Archie." He turned a palm up. "You would have to say yes or no. The way I do it, you can biaiser if you wish." <==
I had to ask him how to spell it so I could look it up when I went to the office. Sitting, I picked up the Times, and my brow went up when I saw that it had made the front page. Probably on account of Martin Kirk; the Times loves architects as much as it hates disk jockeys and private detectives. It had nothing useful to add to what I had got from Lon, but it mentioned that Mrs. Kirk had been born in Manhattan, Kansas. Any other paper which had dug up that detail would have had a feature piece about born in Manhattan and died in Manhattan.
After three griddle cakes with homemade sausage and one with thyme honey, and two cups of coffee, I made it to the office in time to have the desks dusted, fresh water in the vase, biaiser looked up, and the mail opened, when Wolfe came down from the plant rooms. I waited until the orchids were in the vase and he had sat and glanced through the mail to tell him that it now looked as if someone had sent me a hot piece of evidence in a homicide, and I intended to find out why, of course on my own time, and anyway he wouldn’t be needing me since apparently there was nobody that needed him.
His lips tightened. "Evidence? Merely a conjecture."
"No, sir. I took it to Ludlow and it’s human blood. So I gave it to Cramer. Of
course you’ve read the Times?" "Yes."

Wolfe made a face. That complicated it. The mere thought of a man going without food was disagreeable, and to have one there in his house was intolerable. He had to either get him out in a hurry or feed him. "Why should I

 make allowances?" he demanded.
Kirk actually tried to smile, and it made me want to feed him myself. "I know about you," he said. "You’re hard. And you charge high fees. I can pay you, don’t worry about that. They think I killed my wife. They let me go, but they - "
"Did you kill your wife?"
==> "No. But they think I did, and they think they can prove it. I haven’t got a lawyer, and I don’t know any lawyer I want to go to. I came to you because I know about you - partly that, and partly because they asked me a lot of questions about you - about you and Archie Goodwin." He looked at me, blinking to manage the change of focus. "You’re Archie Goodwin, aren’t you?" <==
I told him yes and he went back to Wolfe. "They asked if I knew you or Goodwin, if I had ever met you, and they seemed to think I had - no, they did think I had. It seemed to have some connection with something that was mailed to Goodwin, and something about a necktie, and something about a phone call he got yesterday. I’m sorry to be so vague, but I said you’d have to make allowances, I’m not myself. I haven’t been myself since - I found - " His jaw had started to work and he stopped to control it. "My wife," he said. "They kept at me that she wasn’t much of a wife, and all right, she wasn’t, but if a woman - I mean if a man - "
He stopped again to handle his jaw. In a moment he went on, "So I came to you partly because I thought you might know about a necktie and a phone call and something that was mailed to Goodwin. Do you?"
"Possibly." Wolfe was regarding him. "Mr. Kirk. You said you can pay me, but I don’t sell information; I sell only services."
"That’s what I want, your services."
"You want to hire me to investigate this affair?" "Yes. That’s why I’m here."

 comprehend?"
"I’m better. I didn’t think I could eat. I’m glad you made me." He didn’t look any better.
Wolfe nodded. "The brain can be hoodwinked but not the stomach. First, then, your statement that you didn’t kill your wife is of course of no weight. I have assumed that you didn’t for reasons of my own, which I reserve. Do you know or suspect who did kill her?"
"No. There are - No."
==> "Then attend. An item in yesterday’s mail to this house was an envelope addressed to Mr. Goodwin, typewritten. A paper inside had a typewritten note saying, ‘Archie Goodwin, keep this until you hear from me, JNV.’ The envelope and paper were the engraved stationery of James Neville Vance. Also in the envelope was a four-in-hand necktie, cream-colored with brown diagonal stripes, and it had a spot on it, a large brown stain." <==
Kirk was squinting, concentrating. "So that’s how it was. They never told me exactly..."
"They wouldn’t. Neither would I if I weren’t engaged in your interest. At a quarter past eleven yesterday morning Mr. Goodwin got a phone call, and a voice that squeaked, presumably for disguise, said it was James Neville Vance and asked him to burn what he had received in the mail. Mr. Goodwin, provoked, went to Two-nineteen Horn Street and was admitted by Vance, who identified the tie as one of his but denied that he had sent it. As Mr. Goodwin was about to go a policeman arrived who wanted access to your apartment, and he was with Mr. Vance and the policeman when your wife’s body was discovered, but he left immediately. Later he took - "
"But what - "
"Don’t interrupt. He took the tie to a laboratory and learned that the spot was human blood. He gave the tie, and the envelope and letterhead, to a law officer who had been told of the tie episode by Mr. Vance, and the police have established that the blood is the same type as your wife’s. You say they think they can prove that you killed your wife. Did they take your fingerprints?"
"Yes. They - I let them."

"He must be. I saw him come in and I haven’t seen him come out." "Then he’s here. And?"
"Would you mind telling me whose house - who lives here?" "Nero Wolfe. It’s his house and he lives here."
"That’s an odd name. Nero Wolfe? What does he - Is he a lawyer?"
Either she meant it or she was extremely good. If the former, it would be a pleasure to tell Wolfe and see him grunt. "No," I said. Let her work for it.
"Is Mr. Kirk all right?"
==> "We haven’t been introduced," I said. "My name is Archie Goodwin and I live here. Your turn." <==


Her mouth opened and closed again. She considered it, her eyes meeting mine exactly as they had when she couldn’t see me. "I’m Rita Fougere," she said. "Mrs. Paul Fougere. Will you tell Mr. Kirk I’m here and would like to see him?"
It was my turn to consider. The rule didn’t apply - the rule that I am to take no one in to Wolfe without consulting him; she wanted to see Kirk, not Wolfe. And I was riled. The tie had been mailed to me, not him, but he hadn’t even glanced at me before taking Kirk on and feeding him. I was by no means satisfied that Kirk was straight, and I wanted to see how he took it when Paul Fougere’s wife suddenly appeared.
"You might as well tell him yourself," I said. "Also you might as well know that Nero Wolfe is a private detective, and so am I. Come in."

I had known when I let them in that Fougere had decided on his line. It’s easy to see when a man’s all set. So the unexpected question flustered him. "You know damn well I didn’t," he said. "You know who did, or you ought to."
"Possibly I don’t. Do you?"
Fougere looked at his wife, at me, and back at Wolfe. He was adjusting. "You’d like that, wouldn’t you?" he said. "With witnesses. All right, I can’t prove it, and

 anyway that’s not up to me, it’s up to the cops. But I’m not going to sign anything. I’ve told Vance I shouldn’t have said it, and I’ve told my wife. Ask her." He turned to me. "You were the only other one that heard me. I’m telling you now, I can’t prove it and I shouldn’t have said it." Back to Wolfe: "That covers it. Now try hooking me for defamation of character."
==> "Pfui." Wolfe flipped a hand to dismiss it. "I never intended to. That was only to get you here. I wanted to tell you something and ask you something. First, you’re a blatherskite. You may perhaps know that Mr. Kirk didn’t kill his wife, but you can’t possibly know that he did. Manifestly you’re either a jackass or a murderer, and conceivably both." He turned his head. "Archie. A twenty-dollar bill, please." <==
I went to the safe and got a twenty from the petty cash drawer and came back and offered it, but he shook his head. "Give it to Mrs. Fougere." To Paul: "I assume your wife is an acceptable stakeholder. Give her a dollar. Twenty to one Mr. Kirk did not kill his wife."
"You’ve got a bet." Fougere got out his wallet, extracted a bill, and handed it to me. "You keep it, Goodwin. My wife might spend it. I suppose his conviction decides it? Do I have to wait until after the appeals and all the horsing around?"
Obviously Rita wasn’t hearing him. Probably she had had a lot of practice at not hearing him. She was gazing at Wolfe. "You really mean that, don’t you?" she asked. "You mean it?"
"I expect to win that dollar, madam." His eyes stayed at Fougere. "As for you, sir, let’s see how sure you are. I would like to ask some questions which may give you a hint of my expectations. If you don’t care to hear them you are of course at liberty to go."
Fougere laughed. It would be fair to say that he giggled, but I’ll give him a break. He laughed. "Hell, I’ve got a bet down," he said. "Go right ahead. You’ve already asked me if I killed her. I’ve answered that."

Cramer uttered a word about the same flavor as the one Fougere had used, but of

course there was no lady present. He followed it up. "I suppose I’d send it to the Commissioner so he could frame it?" He flattened his palms on the chair arms. "Look, Wolfe. I know you. I know you’ve got something. I admit your four points taken together add up. I’ll take your word that you won’t send Goodwin to break and enter. I know I can’t pry any more out of you even if it wasn’t time for you to eat, and anyway I eat too. But you say I’m to keep Vance until I hear from you or Goodwin, and that might mean all night, and he’s not just some bum. Nothing doing. Make it tomorrow morning, say ten o’clock, and limit it to six hours if I don’t hear from you or Goodwin, and I’ll buy it."
Wolfe grinned. "That’s better anyway. I was rushing it. I said send a man to get him."
"I heard you."
==> "Very well." Wolfe turned. "Archie. Mr. Cramer and I need a few minutes to make sure of details. Tell Fritz. And use the phone in the kitchen to get Mrs. Fougere. I must see her this evening. Also get Saul and Fred and Orrie. I want them either this evening or at eight in the morning." <==
I rose. "Does it matter which?" "No."
I beat it to the kitchen.

IF YOU EVER NEED an operative and only the best will do, get Saul Panzer if you can. If Saul isn’t available, get Fred Durkin or Orrie Cather. That was the trio who entered James Neville Vance’s apartment with me at a quarter past ten Thursday morning.
What made the entry legal was that when I rang the bells, both downstairs and upstairs, the doors were opened from the inside. Who opened them was Rita Fougere. Upstairs she held it open until we were in and then closed it. I preferred not to touch the door - not that it mattered, but I like things neat.

Silence. "No." More silence. "Confound it." Still more. "Very well. Fritz will have something ready."
"Better make it half past and - " He had hung up.

INSPECTOR CRAMER SETTLED BACK in the red leather chair, narrowed his eyes at Wolfe, and rasped, "I’ve told Mr. Vance that this won’t be on any official record and he can answer your questions or not as he pleases."
He wouldn’t have settled back if he had been the only city employee present, since he knew that almost certainly some fur was going to fly. Sergeant Purley Stebbins was there at his right on a chair against the wall. Purley never sits with his back to anyone, even his superior officer, if he can help it. James Neville Vance was on a chair facing Wolfe’s desk, between Cramer and me. Rita Fougere was on the couch at the left of my desk, and Saul and Fred and Orrie were grouped over by the big globe.
==> "There won’t be many questions," Wolfe told Cramer. "Nothing remains to be satisfied but my curiosity on a point or two." His head turned. "Mr. Vance, only you can satisfy it." To me: "Archie?" <==
I regretted having to take my eyes away from Vance. Not that I thought he needed watching; it was just that I wanted to. You can learn things, or you think you can, from the face of a man who knows something is headed for him but doesn’t know exactly what and is trying to be ready to meet it. Up to that point Vance’s face hadn’t increased my knowledge of human nature. His lips were drawn in tight, and that made his oversized chin even more out of proportion.

 When Wolfe cued me I had to leave it. I got the seven ties from a drawer, put them in a row on Wolfe’s desk, and stood by.
"Those," Wolfe told Vance, "are the seven ties that remained on the rack in your closet. I produce them - "
A growl from Cramer stopped him. It would have stopped anybody. It became words. "So you did. Stebbins, take Mr. Vance out to the car. I want to talk to Wolfe."

Bonny Kirk had last been seen alive, to present knowledge, by a man from a package store who had delivered a bottle of vodka to her at the apartment door, and been paid by her, a little before one o’clock Monday afternoon. The unopened vodka bottle, found under the couch with blood on it, had been used to smash Bonny Kirk’s skull sometime between one P.M. and eight P.M. Monday, the latter limit having been supplied by the medical examiner.
Among those who had been summoned or escorted to the DA’s office were Martin Kirk, James Neville Vance, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Fougere, and Bert Odom, the janitor. Presumably some of them, perhaps all, were still there.
For all that and a lot more I’m leaving out I didn’t owe Lon anything, since on our give-and-take record to date I had a credit balance, and I didn’t mention the necktie. Of course he wanted to know who Wolfe’s client was and what about Vance, and it never hurts to have Wolfe’s name in the paper, not to mention mine, but since the whole point was that Wolfe was short on clients I decided to save it. Naturally he didn’t believe it, that Wolfe had no client, and when I got up to go he said, "No welcome and no fare you well either."
I took a taxi because Wolfe likes to find me in the office when he comes down from the plant rooms at six o’clock, and he pays me and I had spent the day on personal chores, but with the traffic at that hour I might as well have walked, and it was ten past six when the hackie finally made it. As I was climbing out, a car I recognized pulled up just behind, and as I stood a man I also recognized got out of it - a big solid specimen with a big red face topped by an old felt hat even on a hot August day. As he approached I greeted him, "I’ll be damned. You yourself?"
==> Ignoring me, he called to my hackie, "Where did you get this fare?" Apparently the hackie recognized Inspector Cramer of Homicide South, for he called back, "Forty-second and Lexington, Inspector." <==
"All right, move on." To me: "We’ll go in."
I shook my head. "I’ll save you the trouble. Mr. Wolfe has a new book and there’s no point in annoying him. The tie was mailed to me, not him, and he knows nothing about it and doesn’t want to."
"I’d rather get that from him. Come on."

Nothing doing. He’s sore enough as it is, and so am I. I’ve wasted a day. I’ve learned that the spot on the tie is human blood, but what - "

 Try it."
"Archie." He turned a palm up. "You would have to say yes or no. The way I do it, you can biaiser if you wish."
I had to ask him how to spell it so I could look it up when I went to the office. Sitting, I picked up the Times, and my brow went up when I saw that it had made the front page. Probably on account of Martin Kirk; the Times loves architects as much as it hates disk jockeys and private detectives. It had nothing useful to add to what I had got from Lon, but it mentioned that Mrs. Kirk had been born in Manhattan, Kansas. Any other paper which had dug up that detail would have had a feature piece about born in Manhattan and died in Manhattan.
After three griddle cakes with homemade sausage and one with thyme honey, and two cups of coffee, I made it to the office in time to have the desks dusted, fresh water in the vase, biaiser looked up, and the mail opened, when Wolfe came down from the plant rooms. I waited until the orchids were in the vase and he had sat and glanced through the mail to tell him that it now looked as if someone had sent me a hot piece of evidence in a homicide, and I intended to find out why, of course on my own time, and anyway he wouldn’t be needing me since apparently there was nobody that needed him.
His lips tightened. "Evidence? Merely a conjecture."
==> "No, sir. I took it to Ludlow and it’s human blood. So I gave it to Cramer. Of <==
course you’ve read the Times?" "Yes."
"The blood is the same type as Mrs. Kirk’s. If it was or is a floundering numskull, obviously I’d better see - "
The doorbell rang.
I got up and went, telling myself it was even money it was James Neville Vance, but it wasn’t. A glance at the one-way glass panel in the front door settled that. It was a panhandler who had run out of luck and started ringing doorbells - a tall, lanky one pretending he had to lean against the jamb to keep himself upright. Opening the door, I said politely, "It’s a hard life. Good morning."
He got me in focus with bleary eyes and said, "I would like to see Nero Wolfe.

"Neither. He’s had no sleep and not much to eat. Tell him to come this evening, say nine o’clock, if he’s awake, and report on his talk with Mr. Vance."
"You tell him," I said and hung up. Being a salaried employee, I should of course keep my place in the presence of company, and that’s exactly what I was doing, keeping my place. I had had enough and then some, and Wolfe’s glare, which of course came automatically, was wasted because my head was turned and he had my profile, including the set of my jaw. When Rita was through with the phone he took it, spoke briefly with his client, cradled it, and looked at the clock. Six minutes to lunch.

Do you want me any more?" she asked him. "I’d like to go." "Later perhaps," he said. "If you’ll phone a little after six?"
I got up and spoke. "If you don’t mind, Mrs. Fougere." I crossed to the door to the front room and opened it. "If you’ll wait in here just a few minutes?"
==> She looked at Wolfe, saw that he had no comment, and came. When she had crossed the sill I closed the door, which is as soundproof as the wall, went to Wolfe’s desk, and said, "If it blows up in your face you’re not going to blame it on me. I merely called your attention a couple of times to the fact that a fee would be welcome. I didn’t say it was desperate, that you should grab a measly grand from a character who is probably going to be tagged for the big one. And now when he says he is going to see Vance, to handle the tie question on his own - and the tie was sent to me, not you - you not only don’t veto it, you don’t even tell me to go and sit in. Also she’s going there too, that’s obvious, and you merely tell her to phone you later. I admit you’re a genius, but when you took his check you couldn’t possibly have had the faintest idea whether he was guilty or not, and even now you don’t know the score. They may have him absolutely wrapped up. The tie was mailed to me and I gave it to Cramer, and I’m asking, not respectfully." <==
He nodded. "Well said. A good speech." "Thank you. And?"
"I didn’t tell you to go because it’s lunchtime. Also I doubt if you would get anything useful. Naturally I’ll have to see Mr. Vance - and Mr. Fougere. As for desperation, when I took Mr. Kirk’s check I knew it was extremely improbable that he had killed his wife, and I - "
"How?"
He shook his head. "You call me to account? You know everything that I know; ponder it yourself. If instead of lunch you choose to be present at a futile conversation, do so by all means. I will not be hectored into an explanation you shouldn’t need."
Fritz entered to announce lunch, saw what the atmosphere was, and stood. I went and opened the door to the front room, passed through, and told Rita, "All right, Mrs. Fougere. I’m going along."

"I agree." I sat down. "I’m up with you. There were two things. Right?" "Four."
"Then I’m shy a couple. I have his phoning and his letting me have the tie. What else?"
"Only seven ties. Why?"
"Oh." I looked at it. "Okay. And?"
"Well... take you. What have you that is a part of you? Say the relics you keep in a locked drawer. Would you give one of them to someone casually?"
==> "No." I gave that a longer look. "Uhuh," I conceded. "Check. But all four points wouldn’t convince a jury that he’s a murderer, and I doubt if they would convince Cramer or the DA that he ought to be jugged." <==
"Certainly not. We have a job before we’re ready for Mr. Cramer, and not an easy one. Phenomena needed for proof may not exist, and even if they do they may be undiscoverable. Our only recourse - "
The doorbell rang. I got up and went to the hall, took a look, stepped back into the office, and said, "Nuts. Cramer."
"No," he snapped.
"Do you want to count ten?" "No."

I admit it’s a pleasure to slip the bolt in, open the door the two inches the chain permits, and through the crack tell a police inspector that Mr. Wolfe is engaged and can’t be disturbed. The simple pleasures of a private detective. But that time I didn’t have it. I was still a step short of the door when a bellow came from the office, my name, and I turned and went back.

The doorbell rang. "Maybe this time you should count ten," I suggested. "No. Bring him."
==> I went. From my long acquaintance with Cramer’s face I can tell with one glance through the glass if he’s on the warpath, so I knew he wasn’t before I opened the door. He even greeted me as if it didn’t hurt. Of course he didn’t let me take his hat, that would have been going too far, but he removed it on his way down the hall. When he’s boiling he leaves it on. From the way he greeted Wolfe it seemed likely that he would have offered a hand to shake if he hadn’t known that Wolfe never did. <==
"Another hot day," he said and sat in the red leather chair, not settling back, and hanging on to his hat. "I just stopped in on my way home. You’re never on your way home, because you’re always home."
I stared at him. Unbelievable. He was chatting!
Wolfe grunted. "I go out now and then. Will you have some beer?" That was logical. If Cramer acted like a guest, he had to act like a host.
"No, thanks." Pals. "A couple of questions and I’ll go. The district attorney has about decided to hold Martin Kirk on a homicide charge. Kirk was here today for over an hour. Are you working for him?"
"Yes."

Cramer put his hat on the stand at his elbow. "I’m not going to pretend that I’m here to hand you something - like a chance to cut loose from a murderer. The fact is, frankly, I think it’s possible the DA’s office is moving a little too fast. There are several reasons why I think that. The fact that you have taken Kirk on as a client isn’t the most important one, but I admit it is one.

"Another hot day," he said and sat in the red leather chair, not settling back, and hanging on to his hat. "I just stopped in on my way home. You’re never on your way home, because you’re always home."
I stared at him. Unbelievable. He was chatting!
Wolfe grunted. "I go out now and then. Will you have some beer?" That was logical. If Cramer acted like a guest, he had to act like a host.
"No, thanks." Pals. "A couple of questions and I’ll go. The district attorney has about decided to hold Martin Kirk on a homicide charge. Kirk was here today for over an hour. Are you working for him?"
"Yes."

One corner of Wolfe’s mouth went up a sixteenth of an inch, his kind of a smile. "A new approach, Mr. Cramer. Rather transparent."
"The hell it is. It’s a compliment. I wouldn’t use it with any other private dick alive, and you know it. I’m not shoving, I’m just asking."
"Well. It’s barely possible ..." Wolfe focused narrowed eyes on a corner of his desk and rubbed his nose with a fingertip. Pure fake. He had had his idea, whatever it was, when he bellowed me back to the office. He held the pose for ten seconds and then moved his eyes to Cramer and said, "I know who killed Mrs. Kirk."

"Then I don’t see ..." Moving back in the chair, he lost the cigar. It dropped to the floor. He ignored it. "No. Vance is a respectable citizen in good standing. You’d have to open up."

Wolfe nodded. "I’m prepared to. Not to give you facts, for you already have them; I’ll merely expound. You shouldn’t need it, but you have been centered on Mr. Kirk. Do you know all the details of the necktie episode? Mr. Goodwin getting it in the mail, the phone call he received, and his visit to Mr. Vance?"

"Yes."
"Then attend. Four points. First the phone call. It came at a quarter past eleven. You assume that Mr. Kirk made it, pretending he was Vance. That’s untenable, or at least implausible. How would he dare? For all he knew, Mr. Goodwin had phoned Vance or gone to see him immediately after opening the envelope. For him to phone and say he was Vance would have been asinine."
==> Cramer grunted. "He was off his hinges. The shape he was in, he wouldn’t see that." <==
"I concede the possibility. The second point. When Mr. Goodwin went to see Vance he showed him the envelope and letterhead and let him take the tie to examine it. Vance was completely mystified. You know what was said and done. He inspected the ties in his closet and said that the one that had been mailed to Mr. Goodwin was his. But when Mr. Goodwin asked for it he handed it over without hesitation. Preposterous."
Cramer shook his head. "I don’t think so. The body hadn’t been discovered. He thought it was just some screwy gag."
"Pfui. One of his ties taken from his closet, his stationery used to mail it to a private detective with a message ostensibly from him, and the phone call; and he was so devoid of curiosity or annoyance that he let Mr. Goodwin take the tie, and the envelope and letterhead, with no sign of reluctance? Nonsense."
"But he did. If he killed her, why isn’t it still nonsense?"
"Because it was part of his devious and crackbrained plan." Wolfe looked at the clock. "It’s too close to dinnertime to go into that now. It was ill-conceived and ill-executed, and it was infantile, but it wasn’t nonsense. The third point, and the most significant: two missing neckties. He had nine and had given one to Mr. Kirk, and there were only seven left. Of course you have accounted for that in your theory. How?"

That’s obvious. Kirk took it from Vance’s closet. Part of his plan to implicate Vance."

Wolfe nodded. "As Vance intended you to. But have you examined that assumption thoroughly?"
"Yes. I don’t like it. That’s one reason I think the DA is moving too fast. Kirk would have been a sap to do that. Someone else could have taken it to implicate Kirk. For instance, Fougere."
"Why not Vance himself?"
"Because a man doesn’t smash a woman’s skull unless he has a damn good reason and Vance had no reason at all."
Wolfe grunted. "I challenge that, but first the fourth point. Those neckties were an integral item of James Neville Vance’s projection of his selfhood. Made exclusively for him, they were more than merely distinctive and personal; they were morsels of his ego. Conceivably he might have given one of them to someone close and dear to him, but not to Martin Kirk - not unless it was an essential step in an undertaking of vital importance. So it was."
==> "Damn it," Cramer growled, "his reason!" <==
A corner of Wolfe’s mouth went up. "Your new approach is an improvement, Mr. Cramer. You know I wouldn’t fix on a man as a murderer without a motive, so I must have one for Mr. Vance, and you want it. Not now. You would get up and go. That would be enough for you to take to the district attorney, and while it would postpone a murder charge against my client it would by no means clear him permanently, because I strongly doubt if you can get enough evidence against Vance to hold him, let alone convict him. My knowledge of Vance’s motive is by hearsay, so don’t bother to warn me about withholding evidence; I have none that you don’t have. If I get some I’ll be glad to share it. I need to know with certainty where Mr. Vance will be this evening from ten o’clock on, and when Mr. Goodwin told me that you were at the door it occurred to me that the surest way would be for you to have him with you. Do you want it in writing, signed by both of us, that there will be no illegal act - under penalty of losing our licenses?"
Cramer uttered a word about the same flavor as the one Fougere had used, but of

course there was no lady present. He followed it up. "I suppose I’d send it to the Commissioner so he could frame it?" He flattened his palms on the chair arms. "Look, Wolfe. I know you. I know you’ve got something. I admit your four points taken together add up. I’ll take your word that you won’t send Goodwin to break and enter. I know I can’t pry any more out of you even if it wasn’t time for you to eat, and anyway I eat too. But you say I’m to keep Vance until I hear from you or Goodwin, and that might mean all night, and he’s not just some bum. Nothing doing. Make it tomorrow morning, say ten o’clock, and limit it to six hours if I don’t hear from you or Goodwin, and I’ll buy it."
Wolfe grinned. "That’s better anyway. I was rushing it. I said send a man to get him."

IF YOU EVER NEED an operative and only the best will do, get Saul Panzer if you can. If Saul isn’t available, get Fred Durkin or Orrie Cather. That was the trio who entered James Neville Vance’s apartment with me at a quarter past ten Thursday morning.
What made the entry legal was that when I rang the bells, both downstairs and upstairs, the doors were opened from the inside. Who opened them was Rita Fougere. Upstairs she held it open until we were in and then closed it. I preferred not to touch the door - not that it mattered, but I like things neat.

The way you prowl a place depends on what you’re after. If you’re looking for one large item, say a stolen elephant, of course it’s simple. The toughest is when you’re just looking. We did want one specific item, a necktie, but also we wanted anything whatever that might help, no matter what, and Saul and Fred and Orrie had been thoroughly briefed. So we were just looking after Saul found the necktie, and that means things like inspecting the seams of a mattress and unfolding handkerchiefs and flipping through the pages of books. It takes a lot longer when you are leaving everything exactly as it was.
We had been at it over an hour when Saul found the tie. I had shown them the seven on the rack in the closet so they would know what it looked like. Saul and Orrie were up in the studio, and when I heard them coming down the spiral stair I knew they had something and met them at the foot, and Saul handed it to me. It was folded, and pinned to it was one of Vance’s engraved letterheads, on which Saul had written: "Found by me at 11:25 A.M. on August 9, 1962, inside a piano score of Scriabin’s Vers la Flamme which was in a cabinet in the studio of James Neville Vance at 219 Horn Street, Manhattan, New York City." He had signed it with his little twirl on the tail of the z.
"You’re my hero," I told him. "It would be an honor to tie your shoestrings and I want your autograph. But you know how Orrie is on gags and so do I. We’ll take a look."

entered the bedroom, with them following, and went to the closet. The seven were still on the rack; I counted them twice. "Okay," I told Saul, "it’s it. I’ll vote for you for President." I took the seven from the rack and handed them to him. "Here, we’ll take them along."
==> After that it was just looking, both in the apartment and in the studio, and that gets tedious. By two o’clock it was damn tedious because we were hungry and we had decided not to take time out to eat, but Cramer had agreed to keep Vance for six hours, and while we had Exhibit A and that was all Wolfe really expected, an Exhibit X would be deeply appreciated. So we kept at it. <==
A little before three o’clock I was standing in the middle of the living room frowning around. Rita was lying on a couch with her eyes closed. Fred was up in the studio with Saul and Orrie. I was trying to remember some little something that had been in my mind an hour ago, and finally I did. When Fred had taken a pile of gloves from a drawer he had looked in each glove but hadn’t felt in it, and he hadn’t taken them to the light. I went to the bedroom, got the gloves from the drawer, took them to the window, and really looked; and in the fifth glove, a pigskin hand-sewed number, there was Exhibit X. When I saw it inside the glove I thought it was just a gob of some kind of junk, but when I pulled it out and saw what it was I felt something I hadn’t felt very often, a hot spot at the base of my spine. I don’t often talk to myself either, but I said aloud, "Believe it or not, that’s exactly what it is. It has to be." I put it back in the glove, put the glove in my pocket, returned the other gloves to the drawer, went to the phone on the bedstand, and dialed a number.
Wolfe’s voice came: "Yes?" I’ve been trying for years to get him to answer the phone properly.
"Me," I said. "We’ll be there in less than half an hour. Saul found the tie. It was in a piano score in a cabinet in the studio. I just found Exhibit X. I can tell you what he did. After he killed her he cut off a lock of her hair with blood on it, plenty of blood, and took it for a keepsake. After the blood was dry he put it inside one of his gloves in a drawer, which is where I found it. That has to be it. You may not believe it till you see it, but you will then."
"Indeed." A pause. "Satisfactory. Very satisfactory. Bring the glove."
"Certainly. A suggestion - or call it a request. Tell Cramer to have him there at a quarter after four, or half past. We’re starving, including Mrs. Fougere, and we

When Fred had taken a pile of gloves from a drawer he had looked in each glove but hadn’t felt in it, and he hadn’t taken them to the light. I went to the bedroom, got the gloves from the drawer, took them to the window, and really looked; and in the fifth glove, a pigskin hand-sewed number, there was Exhibit X. When I saw it inside the glove I thought it was just a gob of some kind of junk, but when I pulled it out and saw what it was I felt something I hadn’t felt very often, a hot spot at the base of my spine. I don’t often talk to myself either, but I said aloud, "Believe it or not, that’s exactly what it is. It has to be." I put it back in the glove, put the glove in my pocket, returned the other gloves to the drawer, went to the phone on the bedstand, and dialed a number.
Wolfe’s voice came: "Yes?" I’ve been trying for years to get him to answer the phone properly.
"Me," I said. "We’ll be there in less than half an hour. Saul found the tie. It was in a piano score in a cabinet in the studio. I just found Exhibit X. I can tell you what he did. After he killed her he cut off a lock of her hair with blood on it, plenty of blood, and took it for a keepsake. After the blood was dry he put it inside one of his gloves in a drawer, which is where I found it. That has to be it. You may not believe it till you see it, but you will then."
"Indeed." A pause. "Satisfactory. Very satisfactory. Bring the glove."
==> "Certainly. A suggestion - or call it a request. Tell Cramer to have him there at a quarter after four, or half past. We’re starving, including Mrs. Fougere, and we <==

 need time - "
"You know my schedule. I’ll tell Mr. Cramer six o’clock. Fritz will - "
"No." I was emphatic. "For once you’ll have to skip it. The six hours is up at four o’clock, and if you put it off until six Cramer may let him go home, with or without an escort, and he might find that both the tie and the keepsake are gone. Would that be satisfactory?"
Silence. "No." More silence. "Confound it." Still more. "Very well. Fritz will have something ready."

"Better make it half past and - " He had hung up.

INSPECTOR CRAMER SETTLED BACK in the red leather chair, narrowed his eyes at Wolfe, and rasped, "I’ve told Mr. Vance that this won’t be on any official record and he can answer your questions or not as he pleases."

He wouldn’t have settled back if he had been the only city employee present, since he knew that almost certainly some fur was going to fly. Sergeant Purley Stebbins was there at his right on a chair against the wall. Purley never sits with his back to anyone, even his superior officer, if he can help it. James Neville Vance was on a chair facing Wolfe’s desk, between Cramer and me. Rita Fougere was on the couch at the left of my desk, and Saul and Fred and Orrie were grouped over by the big globe.

"There won’t be many questions," Wolfe told Cramer. "Nothing remains to be satisfied but my curiosity on a point or two." His head turned. "Mr. Vance, only you can satisfy it." To me: "Archie?"
I regretted having to take my eyes away from Vance. Not that I thought he needed watching; it was just that I wanted to. You can learn things, or you think you can, from the face of a man who knows something is headed for him but doesn’t know exactly what and is trying to be ready to meet it. Up to that point Vance’s face hadn’t increased my knowledge of human nature. His lips were drawn in tight, and that made his oversized chin even more out of proportion.

 When Wolfe cued me I had to leave it. I got the seven ties from a drawer, put them in a row on Wolfe’s desk, and stood by.
"Those," Wolfe told Vance, "are the seven ties that remained on the rack in your closet. I produce them - "

A growl from Cramer stopped him. It would have stopped anybody. It became words. "So you did. Stebbins, take Mr. Vance out to the car. I want to talk to Wolfe."

Mr. Goodwin, accompanied by Mr. Panzer, Mr. Durkin, and Mr. Cather, rang the bell at Mr. Vance’s apartment and were admitted by Mrs. Fougere. She was in the apartment with Mr. Vance’s knowledge and consent, having gone there earlier to talk with him. When an officer came to take him to you she remained, with no objection from him. Is that correct, Mrs. Fougere?"
"Yes." It came out a whisper, and she repeated it. "Yes." That time it was a croak.
"Is that correct, Mr. Vance?"
Vance’s drawn-in lips opened and then closed. "I don’t think ..." he mumbled. He raised his voice. "I’m not going to answer that."
"You might answer me," Cramer said. "Is it correct?" "I prefer not to answer."

"Then I’ll proceed," Wolfe said. "I produce these seven ties merely to establish them." He opened a drawer and produced Exhibit A. "Here is an eighth tie. Pinned to it is a statement written and signed by Mr. Panzer, on your stationery. I’ll read it." He did so. "Have you any comment?"
No comment. No response.
"Let me see that," Cramer growled. Of course he would; that’s why I was standing by. I took it from Wolfe and handed it over. He read the statement, twisted around for a look at Saul, and twisted the other way to hand the exhibit to Stebbins.

It’s just as well I haven’t many questions," Wolfe told Vance, "since apparently the few I do have won’t be answered. I’ll try answering them myself, and if you care to correct me, do so. I invite interruptions."

It’s just as well I haven’t many questions," Wolfe told Vance, "since apparently the few I do have won’t be answered. I’ll try answering them myself, and if you care to correct me, do so. I invite interruptions."
He cocked his head. "You realize, sir, that the facts are manifest. The problem is not what you did, or when or how, but why. As for when, you typed that envelope and message to Mr. Goodwin, using your own stationery and having found or made an opportunity to use Mr. Kirk’s typewriter, at least three weeks ago, since that machine wasn’t available after July nineteenth. Mr. Kirk’s disposing of it just then was of course coincidental. So your undertaking was not only premeditated, it was carefully planned. Also you retrieved the tie you had given Mr. Kirk before he moved from his apartment. Using the typewriter and retrieving the tie of course presented no difficulty, since you owned the house and had master keys. Any comment?"
"No."
"Then I’ll continue. Only the whys are left, and I’ll leave the most important one, why you killed her, to the last. For some of them I can offer only conjecture - for instance, why you wished to implicate Mr. Kirk. It may have been a fatuous effort to divert attention from yourself, or, more likely, you merely wanted it known that Mrs. Kirk had not been the victim of some chance intruder, or you had an animus against Mr. Kirk. Any of those would serve. For other whys I can do better than conjecture. Why did you take a tie from your closet and hide it in your studio? That was part of the design to implicate Mr. Kirk, and it was rather shrewd. You calculated - "

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74489    window = 74484 74494


 someone, an essential step in the scheme to involve Mr. Kirk, but why Mr. Goodwin? That’s the point I’m chiefly curious about, and I would sincerely appreciate an answer. Why did you send the tie to Mr. Goodwin?"
"I didn’t."
"Very well, I can’t insist. It’s only that he is my confidential assistant, and I would like to know how you got the strange notion that he would best serve your purpose. He is inquisitive, impetuous, alert, skeptical, pertinacious, and resourceful - the worst choice you could possibly have made. One more why before the last and crucial one: why did you phone Mr. Goodwin to burn the tie? That was unnecessary, because his curiosity was sufficiently aroused without that added fillip; and it was witless, because whoever phoned must have known that he had not already phoned you or gone to see you, and only you could have known that. Do you wish to comment?"
"I didn’t phone him."
I must say that Vance was showing more gumption than I had expected. By letting Wolfe talk he was finding out exactly how deep the hole was, and he was saying nothing.
==> Wolfe turned a hand over. "Now the primary why: why did you kill her? I learned yesterday that you probably had an adequate motive, but as I told Mr. Cramer, that was only hearsay. I had to have a demonstrable fact, an act or an object, and you supplied it. Not yesterday or today; you supplied it Tuesday afternoon when, after killing Mrs. Kirk, you stooped over her battered skull, or knelt or squatted, and cut off a lock of her hair, choosing one that had her blood on it. With a knife, or scissors? Did you stoop, or squat, or kneel?" <==
Vance’s lips moved, but no sound came. Unquestionably he was trying to say "I didn’t" but couldn’t make it.
Wolfe grunted. "I said a demonstrable fact. To demonstrate is to establish as true, and I’ll establish it. Mr. Goodwin found the lock of hair, caked with blood, some two hours ago, in a drawer in your bedroom. He called it a keepsake, but a keepsake is something given and kept for the sake of the giver, a token of friendship. Trophy would be a better term." He opened a desk drawer.
I can move fast and so can Purley Stebbins, but we both misjudged James Neville Vance, at least I did. When he started up at sight of the glove Wolfe took

 from the drawer I started too, but I wasn’t expecting him to dart like lightning, and he did; and he got the glove, snatched it out of Wolfe’s hand. Of course he didn’t keep it long. I came from his left side and Purley from his right, and since he had the glove in his right hand it was Purley who got his wrist and twisted it, and the glove dropped to the floor.

Wolfe stood up. "It’s in the glove," he told Cramer. "Mr. Goodwin, will furnish any details you require, and Mrs. Fougere." He headed for the door. The clock said 5:22. His schedule had hit a snag, but by gum it wasn’t wrecked.

A LITTLE BEFORE FIVE o’clock one afternoon last week the doorbell rang, and through the one-way glass I saw Martin Kirk on the stoop, his overcoat collar turned up and his hat on tight. When I opened the door snow came whirling in. Obviously he was calling on me, not Wolfe, since he knew the schedule, and I was glad to see an ex-client who had paid his bill promptly, so I took his hat and coat and put them on the rack, and ushered him to the office and a chair. When we had exchanged a few remarks about the weather, and his health and mine, and Wolfe’s, and he had declined an offer of a drink, he said he saw that Vance’s lawyer was trying a new approach on an appeal, and I said yeah, when you’ve got money you can do a lot of dodging. With that disposed of, he said he often wondered where he would be now if he hadn’t come straight to Wolfe from the DA’s office that day in August.
"Look," I said, "you’ve said that before. I have all the time there is and I enjoy your company, but you didn’t come all the way here through the worst storm this winter just to chew the fat. Something on your mind?"
He nodded. "I thought you might know - might have an idea." "I seldom do, but it’s possible."

"Why didn’t you stop them?" Vance demanded.
"I thought I did," I said. "With a mauler like Kirk you have to time it."
"I wouldn’t have thought..." He let it go. "Did you say he went to Nero Wolfe?"
"No, he did. But I can confirm it, I was present. He has hired Nero Wolfe. That’s why I’m here. I am collecting information that will establish the innocence of Mr. Wolfe’s client. Have you got any?"
"I’m afraid I haven’t." He was frowning. "But of course he is innocent. What Paul Fougere said, that’s ridiculous. I hope he didn’t tell the police that. But with their experience, I don’t suppose - "
==> The bell tinkled. Vance went to the door and opened it, and in came the law. Anyone with half an eye would know it was the law even if they had never seen or heard of Sergeant Purley Stebbins. Two steps in he stopped for a look and saw me. <==
"Yeah," he said, "I thought so. You and Wolfe are going to be good and sick of this one. I hope you try to hang on." His eyes went right. Fougere had appeared at the rear of the room. "Everybody, huh? I’m sorry to interrupt, Mr. Vance."
He moved. "You’re wanted downtown for more questions, Mr. Kirk. I’ll take you."
Rita made a noise. Kirk tilted his head to look up at the tough, rough face. "My God, I’ve answered all the questions there are."
"We’ve got some new ones. I might as well ask one of them now. Did you buy a typewriter at the Midtown Office Equipment Company on July nineteenth and trade in your old one?"
"Yes. I don’t know - July nineteenth - about then, yes."

 "Are you arresting me?"
"If you prefer it that way I can. Material witness. Or if you balk I’ll phone for a warrant and keep you company till it comes, maybe an hour. With Goodwin here I’ve got to toe the line. He’s hell on wheels, Goodwin is."
Kirk made it to his feet. "All right," he mumbled. He had been without sleep for thirty hours and maybe more. Rita Fougere aimed those eyes at me.
I bowed out. Being hell on wheels is fine and dandy if you have anywhere to steer for, but I hadn’t. I went and opened the door and on out, took the elevator down, exchanged no greeting with the driver of the police car out front, though we had met, walked till I found a taxi, and told the hackie 618 West 35th Street; and when he said that was Nero Wolfe’s house I actually said such is fame. That’s the shape I was in.
Wolfe was at table in the dining room, putting a gob of his favorite cheese on a wafer. When I entered he looked up and said politely, "Fritz is keeping the kidneys warm."
==> I stopped three steps in. "Many thanks," I said even more politely. "You were right as usual; the conversation was futile. They had a tail on Kirk, here and to the hotel and on to Horn Street. When Purley Stebbins arrived at Vance’s apartment he knew Kirk was there and he wasn’t surprised to see me. He had come for your client and took him. They have found the typewriter that addressed that envelope to me and the message. It belonged to Kirk, but on July nineteenth he traded it in on another one. Since you don’t talk business at meals, I’ll eat in the kitchen." <==
I wheeled, hell on wheels, and went to the kitchen.

NEARLY FOUR HOURS LATER, at six o’clock, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Fougere were in the office, waiting for Wolfe to come down from the plant rooms - she in the red leather chair and he in one of the yellow ones in front of Wolfe’s desk. To my surprise he had two marks, a red slightly puffed nose and a little bruise under his left eye. I hadn’t thought Kirk had shown that much power, but of course with bare knuckles it doesn’t take much.

"No." I was emphatic. "For once you’ll have to skip it. The six hours is up at four o’clock, and if you put it off until six Cramer may let him go home, with or without an escort, and he might find that both the tie and the keepsake are gone. Would that be satisfactory?"
Silence. "No." More silence. "Confound it." Still more. "Very well. Fritz will have something ready."
"Better make it half past and - " He had hung up.

INSPECTOR CRAMER SETTLED BACK in the red leather chair, narrowed his eyes at Wolfe, and rasped, "I’ve told Mr. Vance that this won’t be on any official record and he can answer your questions or not as he pleases."
==> He wouldn’t have settled back if he had been the only city employee present, since he knew that almost certainly some fur was going to fly. Sergeant Purley Stebbins was there at his right on a chair against the wall. Purley never sits with his back to anyone, even his superior officer, if he can help it. James Neville Vance was on a chair facing Wolfe’s desk, between Cramer and me. Rita Fougere was on the couch at the left of my desk, and Saul and Fred and Orrie were grouped over by the big globe. <==
"There won’t be many questions," Wolfe told Cramer. "Nothing remains to be satisfied but my curiosity on a point or two." His head turned. "Mr. Vance, only you can satisfy it." To me: "Archie?"
I regretted having to take my eyes away from Vance. Not that I thought he needed watching; it was just that I wanted to. You can learn things, or you think you can, from the face of a man who knows something is headed for him but doesn’t know exactly what and is trying to be ready to meet it. Up to that point Vance’s face hadn’t increased my knowledge of human nature. His lips were drawn in tight, and that made his oversized chin even more out of proportion.

 When Wolfe cued me I had to leave it. I got the seven ties from a drawer, put them in a row on Wolfe’s desk, and stood by.
"Those," Wolfe told Vance, "are the seven ties that remained on the rack in your closet. I produce them - "

"I didn’t phone him."
I must say that Vance was showing more gumption than I had expected. By letting Wolfe talk he was finding out exactly how deep the hole was, and he was saying nothing.
Wolfe turned a hand over. "Now the primary why: why did you kill her? I learned yesterday that you probably had an adequate motive, but as I told Mr. Cramer, that was only hearsay. I had to have a demonstrable fact, an act or an object, and you supplied it. Not yesterday or today; you supplied it Tuesday afternoon when, after killing Mrs. Kirk, you stooped over her battered skull, or knelt or squatted, and cut off a lock of her hair, choosing one that had her blood on it. With a knife, or scissors? Did you stoop, or squat, or kneel?"
Vance’s lips moved, but no sound came. Unquestionably he was trying to say "I didn’t" but couldn’t make it.
Wolfe grunted. "I said a demonstrable fact. To demonstrate is to establish as true, and I’ll establish it. Mr. Goodwin found the lock of hair, caked with blood, some two hours ago, in a drawer in your bedroom. He called it a keepsake, but a keepsake is something given and kept for the sake of the giver, a token of friendship. Trophy would be a better term." He opened a desk drawer.
==> I can move fast and so can Purley Stebbins, but we both misjudged James Neville Vance, at least I did. When he started up at sight of the glove Wolfe took <==

 from the drawer I started too, but I wasn’t expecting him to dart like lightning, and he did; and he got the glove, snatched it out of Wolfe’s hand. Of course he didn’t keep it long. I came from his left side and Purley from his right, and since he had the glove in his right hand it was Purley who got his wrist and twisted it, and the glove dropped to the floor.
Cramer picked it up. Purley had Vance by the right arm, and I had him by the left.
Wolfe stood up. "It’s in the glove," he told Cramer. "Mr. Goodwin, will furnish any details you require, and Mrs. Fougere." He headed for the door. The clock said 5:22. His schedule had hit a snag, but by gum it wasn’t wrecked.

A LITTLE BEFORE FIVE o’clock one afternoon last week the doorbell rang, and through the one-way glass I saw Martin Kirk on the stoop, his overcoat collar turned up and his hat on tight. When I opened the door snow came whirling in. Obviously he was calling on me, not Wolfe, since he knew the schedule, and I was glad to see an ex-client who had paid his bill promptly, so I took his hat and coat and put them on the rack, and ushered him to the office and a chair. When we had exchanged a few remarks about the weather, and his health and mine, and Wolfe’s, and he had declined an offer of a drink, he said he saw that Vance’s lawyer was trying a new approach on an appeal, and I said yeah, when you’ve got money you can do a lot of dodging. With that disposed of, he said he often wondered where he would be now if he hadn’t come straight to Wolfe from the DA’s office that day in August.
"Look," I said, "you’ve said that before. I have all the time there is and I enjoy your company, but you didn’t come all the way here through the worst storm this winter just to chew the fat. Something on your mind?"

"Certainly. And if James Neville Vance comes or calls to say that he expects to be charged with the murder of Mrs. Kirk, if that’s who she was, partly because of the tie he didn’t send me, and he wants to hire you, wouldn’t it be convenient to have the tie? And the envelope and letterhead?"
"I have no expectation of being engaged by Mr. Vance. Nor desire."
"Sure. Because you would have to work. I remarked yesterday that the gross take

 for the first seven months of nineteen sixty-two is nine grand behind nineteen sixty-one. I am performing one of the main functions you pay me for."
==> "Not brilliantly," he said and picked up the book. Merely a childish gesture, since Fritz would enter in eight minutes to announce lunch. I went and opened the safe and stashed my souvenirs on a shelf in the inner compartment. <==

INSPECTOR CRAMER of Homicide South came at ten minutes past six.
I had been functioning all afternoon, I don’t say brilliantly. During lunch, in the dining room across the hall, while listening to Wolfe’s table talk with one ear, I decided to make myself scarce while I considered the matter. There was no sense in getting out on a limb just for the hell of it, and a homicide dick might show any minute, so as we left the table I told Wolfe that since we had no expectations or desires I was going out on some personal chores. He gave me a sharp glance, made a face, and headed for the office. As I was turning to the front the phone rang and I went in and got it. If it was the DA’s office inviting me to call, I would make up my mind on the way downtown.
It was Lon Cohen. He had compliments. "No question about it, Archie," he said, "you’d be worth your weight in blood rubies to any newspaper in town, especially the Gazette. At nine-thirty you phone for dope on James Neville Vance. At twelve-twenty, less than three hours later, a cop finds a body in his house and both you and he are present. Marvelous. Any leg man can find out what happened, but knowing what’s going to happen - you’re one in ten million. What’s on the program for tomorrow? I only want a day at a time."
I was a little short with him because my problem was the program for today.

I GOT HOME well after midnight and before going up two flights to bed hit the refrigerator for leftover lobster and a glass of milk, to remove both hunger and the taste of the excuse for bread and stringy corned beef I had been supplied with at the DA’s office.
Since my connection with their homicide had been short and simple, the twenty seconds I had spent in the Kirk apartment, and my connection with Vance hadn’t been a lot longer, an hour of me should have been more than enough, including typing the statement for me to sign, and it wasn’t until after nine o’clock that I realized, from a question by Assistant DA Mandel, what the idea was. They actually thought that the tie thing might be some kind of dodge that I had been in on, and they were keeping me until they got a report on the stain. So I cooled down and took it easy, got on speaking terms with a dick who was put in a room with me to see that I didn’t jump out a window, got him to produce a deck for some friendly gin, and in two hours managed to lose $4.70. I called time at that point and paid him because he was getting sleepy and it would have been next to impossible to keep him ahead.
I got my money’s worth. Around midnight someone came and called him out, and when he returned ten minutes later and said I was no longer needed I gave him a friendly grin, a good loser, no hard feelings, and said, "So the blood’s the same type, huh?" And he nodded and said, "Yeah, modern science is wonderful."
So, I told myself as I got the lobster out, I got not only my money’s worth but my time’s worth, and by the time I was upstairs and in my pajamas I had decided that if Wolfe wasn’t interested I certainly was, and I was going to find out who had sent me that tie even if I had to take a month’s leave of absence.
==> Except in emergencies I get a full eight hours’ sleep, and that was merely a project, not an emergency, so I didn’t get down for breakfast, which I eat in the kitchen, until after ten o’clock. As I got orange juice from the refrigerator and Fritz started the burner under the cake griddle he asked where I had dined, and I said he knew darned well I hadn’t dined at all, since I had phoned that I was at the DA’s office, and he nodded and said, "These clients in trouble." <==
"Look, Fritz," I told him, "you’re a chef, not a diplomat, so why do you keep that up? You know we’ve had no client for a month and you want to know if we’ve hooked one, so why don’t you just ask? Repeat after me, ‘Have we got a client?’

 Try it."
"Archie." He turned a palm up. "You would have to say yes or no. The way I do it, you can biaiser if you wish."
I had to ask him how to spell it so I could look it up when I went to the office. Sitting, I picked up the Times, and my brow went up when I saw that it had made the front page. Probably on account of Martin Kirk; the Times loves architects as much as it hates disk jockeys and private detectives. It had nothing useful to add to what I had got from Lon, but it mentioned that Mrs. Kirk had been born in Manhattan, Kansas. Any other paper which had dug up that detail would have had a feature piece about born in Manhattan and died in Manhattan.

After three griddle cakes with homemade sausage and one with thyme honey, and two cups of coffee, I made it to the office in time to have the desks dusted, fresh water in the vase, biaiser looked up, and the mail opened, when Wolfe came down from the plant rooms. I waited until the orchids were in the vase and he had sat and glanced through the mail to tell him that it now looked as if someone had sent me a hot piece of evidence in a homicide, and I intended to find out why, of course on my own time, and anyway he wouldn’t be needing me since apparently there was nobody that needed him.

"That’s what I want, your services."
"You want to hire me to investigate this affair?" "Yes. That’s why I’m here."
"And you can pay me without undue strain?" "Yes. I have - Yes. Do you want a check now?"

 thousand dollars will do as a retainer."
==> I had to shut my eyes a second to keep from gawking. That wasn’t only unheard of, it was unbelievable. Taking on a job, which meant that he would have to work, without the usual dodging and stalling - that could be on account of the lag in receipts; but taking a murder suspect for a client offhand, no questions asked but the routine did you kill her and can you pay me, without the faintest notion whether he was guilty or not and how much the cops had on him - that simply wasn’t done, not by anybody, let alone Nero Wolfe. I had to clamp my teeth on my lip to sit and take it. As Kirk got out a checkfold and a pen Wolfe pushed a button on his desk, and in a moment Fritz came. <==
"A tray, please," Wolfe told him. "The madrilène is ready?" "Yes, sir."
"And the pudding?"
"Yes, sir."
"A bowl of each, cheese with water cress, and hot tea."
When Fritz turned and went I would have liked to go along, to tell him that there could be something worse than having no client.

AN HOUR LATER, when the doorbell rang again, Kirk was still there and still the client, and I would still have had to toss a coin to decide where I stood on the question, did he or didn’t he?
Wolfe had of course refused to either talk or listen until the tray had come and gone. Kirk had said he couldn’t eat, but when Wolfe insisted he tried, and if a man can swallow anything he can swallow Fritz’s madrilène with beet juice, and after one spoonful of his lemon sherry pudding with brown sugar sauce there’s no argument. The cheese and water cress were still on the tray when I took it to the kitchen, but the bowls were empty.
When I returned Wolfe had started in. "... so I’ll reverse the process," he was saying. "I’ll tell you and then ask you. Are you sufficiently yourself to

 comprehend?"
"I’m better. I didn’t think I could eat. I’m glad you made me." He didn’t look any better.
Wolfe nodded. "The brain can be hoodwinked but not the stomach. First, then, your statement that you didn’t kill your wife is of course of no weight. I have assumed that you didn’t for reasons of my own, which I reserve. Do you know or suspect who did kill her?"

She looked at Wolfe, saw that he had no comment, and came. When she had crossed the sill I closed the door, which is as soundproof as the wall, went to Wolfe’s desk, and said, "If it blows up in your face you’re not going to blame it on me. I merely called your attention a couple of times to the fact that a fee would be welcome. I didn’t say it was desperate, that you should grab a measly grand from a character who is probably going to be tagged for the big one. And now when he says he is going to see Vance, to handle the tie question on his own - and the tie was sent to me, not you - you not only don’t veto it, you don’t even tell me to go and sit in. Also she’s going there too, that’s obvious, and you merely tell her to phone you later. I admit you’re a genius, but when you took his check you couldn’t possibly have had the faintest idea whether he was guilty or not, and even now you don’t know the score. They may have him absolutely wrapped up. The tie was mailed to me and I gave it to Cramer, and I’m asking, not respectfully."
He nodded. "Well said. A good speech." "Thank you. And?"
"I didn’t tell you to go because it’s lunchtime. Also I doubt if you would get anything useful. Naturally I’ll have to see Mr. Vance - and Mr. Fougere. As for desperation, when I took Mr. Kirk’s check I knew it was extremely improbable that he had killed his wife, and I - "
"How?"
He shook his head. "You call me to account? You know everything that I know; ponder it yourself. If instead of lunch you choose to be present at a futile conversation, do so by all means. I will not be hectored into an explanation you shouldn’t need."
==> Fritz entered to announce lunch, saw what the atmosphere was, and stood. I went and opened the door to the front room, passed through, and told Rita, "All right, Mrs. Fougere. I’m going along." <==

WHEN YOU’RE GOOD and sore at someone it’s simple. You cuss him out, to his face if he’s available and privately if he isn’t, and you take steps if and as you can. When you’re sore at yourself it’s even simpler; the subject is right there and can’t skip. But when you’re sore at yourself and someone else at the same time you’re in a fix. If you try to concentrate on one the other one horns in and gets you off balance, and that was the state I was in as I stood aside in the vestibule of Two-nineteen Horn Street while Rita Fougere used her key on the door. In the taxi on the way down I had told her about the necktie problem. She might as well get it from me as later from Kirk, and she might as well understand why Kirk wanted to see Vance.

 "Are you arresting me?"
"If you prefer it that way I can. Material witness. Or if you balk I’ll phone for a warrant and keep you company till it comes, maybe an hour. With Goodwin here I’ve got to toe the line. He’s hell on wheels, Goodwin is."
Kirk made it to his feet. "All right," he mumbled. He had been without sleep for thirty hours and maybe more. Rita Fougere aimed those eyes at me.
I bowed out. Being hell on wheels is fine and dandy if you have anywhere to steer for, but I hadn’t. I went and opened the door and on out, took the elevator down, exchanged no greeting with the driver of the police car out front, though we had met, walked till I found a taxi, and told the hackie 618 West 35th Street; and when he said that was Nero Wolfe’s house I actually said such is fame. That’s the shape I was in.
==> Wolfe was at table in the dining room, putting a gob of his favorite cheese on a wafer. When I entered he looked up and said politely, "Fritz is keeping the kidneys warm." <==
I stopped three steps in. "Many thanks," I said even more politely. "You were right as usual; the conversation was futile. They had a tail on Kirk, here and to the hotel and on to Horn Street. When Purley Stebbins arrived at Vance’s apartment he knew Kirk was there and he wasn’t surprised to see me. He had come for your client and took him. They have found the typewriter that addressed that envelope to me and the message. It belonged to Kirk, but on July nineteenth he traded it in on another one. Since you don’t talk business at meals, I’ll eat in the kitchen."
I wheeled, hell on wheels, and went to the kitchen.
87
NEARLY FOUR HOURS LATER, at six o’clock, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Fougere were in the office, waiting for Wolfe to come down from the plant rooms - she in the red leather chair and he in one of the yellow ones in front of Wolfe’s desk. To my surprise he had two marks, a red slightly puffed nose and a little bruise under his left eye. I hadn’t thought Kirk had shown that much power, but of course with bare knuckles it doesn’t take much.

Cramer uttered a word about the same flavor as the one Fougere had used, but of

course there was no lady present. He followed it up. "I suppose I’d send it to the Commissioner so he could frame it?" He flattened his palms on the chair arms. "Look, Wolfe. I know you. I know you’ve got something. I admit your four points taken together add up. I’ll take your word that you won’t send Goodwin to break and enter. I know I can’t pry any more out of you even if it wasn’t time for you to eat, and anyway I eat too. But you say I’m to keep Vance until I hear from you or Goodwin, and that might mean all night, and he’s not just some bum. Nothing doing. Make it tomorrow morning, say ten o’clock, and limit it to six hours if I don’t hear from you or Goodwin, and I’ll buy it."
Wolfe grinned. "That’s better anyway. I was rushing it. I said send a man to get him."
"I heard you."
==> "Very well." Wolfe turned. "Archie. Mr. Cramer and I need a few minutes to make sure of details. Tell Fritz. And use the phone in the kitchen to get Mrs. Fougere. I must see her this evening. Also get Saul and Fred and Orrie. I want them either this evening or at eight in the morning." <==
I rose. "Does it matter which?" "No."
I beat it to the kitchen.
98
IF YOU EVER NEED an operative and only the best will do, get Saul Panzer if you can. If Saul isn’t available, get Fred Durkin or Orrie Cather. That was the trio who entered James Neville Vance’s apartment with me at a quarter past ten Thursday morning.
What made the entry legal was that when I rang the bells, both downstairs and upstairs, the doors were opened from the inside. Who opened them was Rita Fougere. Upstairs she held it open until we were in and then closed it. I preferred not to touch the door - not that it mattered, but I like things neat.

"Me," I said. "We’ll be there in less than half an hour. Saul found the tie. It was in a piano score in a cabinet in the studio. I just found Exhibit X. I can tell you what he did. After he killed her he cut off a lock of her hair with blood on it, plenty of blood, and took it for a keepsake. After the blood was dry he put it inside one of his gloves in a drawer, which is where I found it. That has to be it. You may not believe it till you see it, but you will then."
"Indeed." A pause. "Satisfactory. Very satisfactory. Bring the glove."
"Certainly. A suggestion - or call it a request. Tell Cramer to have him there at a quarter after four, or half past. We’re starving, including Mrs. Fougere, and we

 need time - "
==> "You know my schedule. I’ll tell Mr. Cramer six o’clock. Fritz will - " <==
"No." I was emphatic. "For once you’ll have to skip it. The six hours is up at four o’clock, and if you put it off until six Cramer may let him go home, with or without an escort, and he might find that both the tie and the keepsake are gone. Would that be satisfactory?"
Silence. "No." More silence. "Confound it." Still more. "Very well. Fritz will have something ready."
"Better make it half past and - " He had hung up.

INSPECTOR CRAMER SETTLED BACK in the red leather chair, narrowed his eyes at Wolfe, and rasped, "I’ve told Mr. Vance that this won’t be on any official record and he can answer your questions or not as he pleases."

He wouldn’t have settled back if he had been the only city employee present, since he knew that almost certainly some fur was going to fly. Sergeant Purley Stebbins was there at his right on a chair against the wall. Purley never sits with his back to anyone, even his superior officer, if he can help it. James Neville Vance was on a chair facing Wolfe’s desk, between Cramer and me. Rita Fougere was on the couch at the left of my desk, and Saul and Fred and Orrie were grouped over by the big globe.
"There won’t be many questions," Wolfe told Cramer. "Nothing remains to be satisfied but my curiosity on a point or two." His head turned. "Mr. Vance, only you can satisfy it." To me: "Archie?"
